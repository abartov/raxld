<head>PREFACE.</head>

<p>
Few men there are who having once visited Greece
do not contrive to visit it again. And yet when the
returned traveller meets the ordinary friend who asks
him where he has been, the next remark is generally,
<q>Dear me! have you not been there before? How is
it you are so fond of going to Greece?</q> There are
even people who imagine a trip to America far more
interesting, and who at all events look upon a trip
to Spain as the same kind of thing—southern climate,
bad food, dirty inns, and general discomfort, odious
to bear, though pleasant to describe afterward in a
comfortable English home.
</p>

<p>
This is a very ignorant way of looking at the
matter, for excepting Southern Italy, there is no
country which can compare with Greece in beauty
and interest to the intelligent traveller. It is not
a land for creature comforts, though the climate is
splendid, and though the hotels in Athens are as
good as those in most European towns. It is not a
land for society, though the society at Athens is
excellent, and far easier of access than that of most
European capitals. But if a man is fond of the large
<pb n='viii'/><anchor id='Pgviii'/>effects of natural scenery, he will find in the Southern
Alps and fiords of Greece a variety and a richness
of color which no other part of Europe affords.
If he is fond of the details of natural scenery, flowers,
shrubs, and trees, he will find the wild-flowers and
flowering-trees of Greece more varied than anything
he has yet seen. If he desires to study national
character, and peculiar manners and customs, he
will find in the hardy mountaineers of Greece one of
the most unreformed societies, hardly yet affected by
the great tide of sameness which is invading all
Europe in dress, fabrics, and usages. And yet, in
spite of the folly still talked in England about brigands,
he will find that without troops, or police, or
patrols, or any of those melancholy safeguards which
are now so obtrusive in England and Ireland, life
and property are as secure as they ever were in our
most civilized homes. Let him not know a word of
history, or of art, and he will yet be rewarded by all
this natural enjoyment; perhaps also, if he be a
politician, he may study the unsatisfactory results of
a constitution made to order, and of a system of free
education planted in a nation of no political training,
but of high intelligence.
</p>

<p>
Need I add that as to Cicero the whole land was
one vast shrine of hallowed memories—<hi rend='italic'>quocunque
incedis, historia est</hi>—so to the man of culture this
splendor of associations has only increased with the
lapse of time and the greater appreciation of human
<pb n='ix'/><anchor id='Pgix'/>perfection. Even were such a land dead to all
further change, and a mere record in its ruins of the
past, I know not that any man of reflection could
satisfy himself with contemplating it. Were he to
revisit the Parthenon, as it stands, every year of his
life, it would always be fresh, it would always be
astonishing. But Greece is a growing country, both
in its youth and in its age. The rapid development
of the nation is altering the face of the country,
establishing new roads and better communications,
improving knowledge among the people, and making
many places accessible which were before beyond
the reach of brief holiday visits. The insecurity
which haunted the Turkish frontier has been pushed
back to the north; new Alps and new monasteries
are brought within the range of Greece. And this
is nothing to what has been done in recovering the
past. Every year there are new excavations made,
new treasures found, new problems in archæology
raised, old ones solved; and so at every visit there
is a whole mass of new matter for the student who
feels he had not yet grasped what was already there.
</p>

<p>
The traveller who revisits the country now after
a lapse of four or five years will find at Athens the
Schliemann museum set up and in order, where the
unmatched treasures of Mycenæ are now displayed
before his astonished eyes. He will find an Egyptian
museum of extraordinary merit—the gift of a
patriotic merchant of Alexandria—in which there
<pb n='x'/><anchor id='Pgx'/>are two figures—that of a queen, in bronze and
silver, and that of a slave kneading bread, in wood—which
alone would make the reputation of any
collection throughout Europe. In the Parthenon
museum he will find the famous statuette, copied
from Phidias’s Athene, and the recent wonder,
archaic statues on which the brightness of the colors
is not more astonishing than the moulding of the
figures.
</p>

<p>
And these are only the most salient novelties. It
is indeed plain that were not the new city covering
the site of the old, discoveries at Athens might be
made perhaps every year, which would reform and
enlarge our knowledge of Greek life and history.
</p>

<p>
But Athens is rapidly becoming a great and rich
city. It already numbers 110,000, without counting
the Peiræus; accordingly, except in digging foundations
for new houses, it is not possible to find room
for any serious excavations. House rent is enormously
high, and building is so urgent that the ordinary
mason receives eight to ten francs per day.
This rapid increase ought to be followed by an equal
increase in the wealth of the surrounding country,
where all the little proprietors ought to turn their
land into market-gardens. I found that either they
could not, or (as I was told) they would not, keep
pace with the increased wants of the city. They
are content with a little, and allow the city to be
supplied—badly and at great cost—from Salonica,
<pb n='xi'/><anchor id='Pgxi'/>Syra, Constantinople, and the islands, while meat
comes in tons from America. How different is the
country round Paris and London!
</p>

<p>
But this is a digression into vulgar matters, when
I had merely intended to inform the reader what
intellectual novelties he would find in revisiting
Athens. For nothing is more slavish in modern
travel than the inability the student feels, for want
of time in long journeys, or want of control over his
conveyance, to stop and examine something which
strikes him beside his path. And that is the main
reason why Oriental—and as yet Greek—travelling
is the best and most instructive of all.
</p>

<p>
You can stop your pony or mule, you can turn
aside from the track which is called your road, you
are not compelled to catch a train or a steamer at a
fixed moment. When roads and rails have been
brought into Greece, hundreds of people will go to
see its beauty and its monuments, and will congratulate
themselves that the country is at last accessible.
But the real charm will be gone. There will be no
more riding at dawn through orchards of oranges
and lemons, with the rich fruit lying on the ground,
and the nightingales, that will not end their exuberant
melody, still outsinging from the deep-green
gloom the sounds of opening day. There will be no
more watching the glowing east cross the silver-gray
glitter of dewy meadows; no more wandering along
grassy slopes, where the scarlet anemones, all
<pb n='xii'/><anchor id='Pgxii'/>drenched with the dews of night, are striving to
raise their drooping heads and open their splendid
eyes to meet the rising sun. There will be no more
watching the serpent and the tortoise, the eagle and
the vulture, and all the living things whose ways and
habits animate the sunny solitudes of the south.
The Greek people now talk of going to Europe, and
coming from Europe, justly too, for Greece is still,
as it always was, part of the East. But the day is
coming when enlightened politicians, like Mr. Tricoupi,
will insist on introducing through all the remotest
glens the civilization of Europe, with all its
benefits forsooth, but with all its shocking ugliness,
its stupid hurry, and its slavish uniformity.
</p>

<p>
I will conclude with a warning to the archæologist,
and one which applies to all amateurs who go to visit
excavations, and cannot see what has been reported
by the actual excavators. As no one is able to see
what the evidences of digging are, except the trained
man, who knows not only archæology, but architecture,
and who has studied the accumulation of soil
in various places and forms, so the observer who
comes to the spot after some years, and expects to
find all the evidences unchanged, commits a blunder
of the gravest kind. As Dr. Dörpfeld, now one of
the highest living authorities on such matters, observed
to me, if you went to Hissarlik expecting to
find there clearly marked the various strata of successive
occupations, you would show that you were
<pb n='xiii'/><anchor id='Pgxiii'/>ignorant of the first elements of practical knowledge.
For in any climate, but especially in these southern
lands, Nature covers up promptly what has been
exposed by man; all sorts of plants spring up along
and across the lines which in the cutting when
freshly made were clear and precise. In a few
years the whole place turns back again into a brake,
or a grassy slope, and the report of the actual diggers
remains the only evidence till the soil is cut
open again in the same way. I saw myself, at
Olympia, important lines disappearing in this way.
Dr. Purgold showed me where the line marking the
embankment of the stadium—it was never surrounded
with any stone seats—was rapidly becoming
effaced, and where the plan of the foundations
was being covered with shrubs and grass. The
day for visiting and verifying the Trojan excavations
is almost gone by. That of all the excavations
will pass away, if they are not carefully kept clear
by some permanent superintendence; and to expect
this of the Greek nation, who know they have endless
more treasures to find in new places, is more
than could reasonably be expected. The proper
safeguard is to do what Dr. Schliemann does, to
have with him not only the Greek ephoros or superintendent—generally
a very competent scholar, and
sometimes not a very friendly witness of foreign
triumphs—but also a first-rate architect, whose joint
observation will correct any hastiness or misprision,
<pb n='xiv'/><anchor id='Pgxiv'/>and so in the mouth of two or more witnesses every
word will be confirmed.
</p>

<p>
In passing on I cannot but remark how strange
it is that among the many rich men in the world
who profess an interest in archæology, not one can
be found to take up the work as Dr. Schliemann did,
to enrich science with splendid fields of new evidence,
and illustrate art, not only with the naïve efforts of
its infancy, but with forgotten models of perfect and
peerless form.

<p>
This New Edition is framed with a view of still
satisfying the demand for the book as a traveller’s
handbook, somewhat less didactic than the official
guide-books, somewhat also, I hope, more picturesque.
For that purpose I have added a new chapter
on mediæval Greece, as well as many paragraphs
with new information, especially the ride over
Mount Erymanthus, <ref target="Pg343">pp. 343</ref>, <hi rend='italic'>sqq.</hi> I have corrected
many statements which are now antiquated by recent
discoveries, and I have obliterated the traces of
controversy borne by the Second Edition. For the
criticisms on the book are dead, while the book survives.
To me it is very pleasant to know that
many visitors to Greece have found it an agreeable
companion.

<head type="sub">INTRODUCTION—FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF THE COAST.</head>

<p>
A voyage to Greece does not at first sight seem
a great undertaking. We all go to and fro to Italy
as we used to go to France. A trip to Rome, or
even to Naples, is now an Easter holiday affair.
And is not Greece very close to Italy on the map?
What signifies the narrow sea that divides them?
This is what a man might say who only considered
geography, and did not regard the teaching of
history. For the student of history cannot look
upon these two peninsulas without being struck
with the fact that they are, historically speaking,
turned back to back; that while the face of Italy
is turned westward, and looks towards France and
Spain, and across to us, the face of Greece looks
eastward, towards Asia Minor and towards Egypt.
Every great city in Italy, except Venice, approaches
or borders the Western Sea—Genoa, Pisa, Florence,
Rome, Naples. All the older history of Rome, its
<pb n='2'/><anchor id='Pg002'/>development, its glories, lie on the west of the
Apennines. When you cross them you come to
what is called the back of Italy; and you feel that
in that flat country, and that straight coast-line, you
are separated from its true beauty and charm.<note place="foot">Though this statement is broadly true, it requires some modification.
I should be sorry to be thought insensible to the beauties,
not only of Ravenna, with its mosaics and its pines, but of Ancona,
of the splendid Monte Gargano, of Trani and Bari, and of
the rich gardens and vineyards of Apulia.</note>
Contrariwise, in Greece, the whole weight and dignity
of its history gravitate towards the eastern
coast. All its great cities—Athens, Thebes, Corinth,
Argos, Sparta—are on that side. Their nearest
neighbors were the coast cities of Asia Minor and
of the Cyclades, but the western coasts were to
them harborless and strange. If you pass Cape
Malea, they said, then forget your home.
</p>

<p>
So it happens that the coasts of Italy and Greece,
which look so near, are outlying and out-of-the way
parts of the countries to which they belong; and if
you want to go straight from real Italy to real
Greece, the longest way is that from Brindisi to
Corfu, for you must still journey across Italy to
Brindisi, and from Corfu to Athens. The shortest
way is to take ship at Naples, and to be carried
round Italy and round Greece, from the centres of
culture on the west of Italy to the centres of culture
(such as they are) on the east of Greece. But this
<pb n='3'/><anchor id='Pg003'/>is no trifling passage. When the ship has left the
coasts of Calabria, and steers into the open sea, you
feel that you have at last left the west of Europe,
and are setting sail for the Eastern Seas. You are,
moreover, in an open sea—the furious Adriatic—in
which I have seen storms which would be creditable
to the Atlantic Ocean, and which at times forbid
even steam navigation.
</p>

<p>
I may anticipate for a moment here, and say that
even now the face of Athens is turned, as of old,
to the East. Her trade and her communications
are through the Levant. Her chief intercourse is
with Constantinople, and Smyrna, and Syra, and
Alexandria.
</p>

<p>
This curious parallel between ancient and modern
geographical attitudes in Greece is, no doubt, greatly
due to the now bygone Turkish rule. In addition
to other contrasts, Mohammedan rule and Eastern
jealousy—long unknown in Western Europe—first
jarred upon the traveller when he touched the coasts
of Greece; and this dependency was once really
part of a great Asiatic Empire, where all the interests
and communications gravitated eastward, and
away from the Christian and better civilized West.
The revolution which expelled the Turks was
unable to root out the ideas which their subjects
had learned; and so, in spite of Greek hatred of the
Turk, his influence still lives through Greece in a
thousand ways.
</p>

<pb n='4'/><anchor id='Pg004'/>

<p>
For many hours after the coasts of Calabria had
faded into the night, and even after the snowy dome
of Etna was lost to view, our ship steamed through
the open sea, with no land in sight; but we were
told that early in the morning, at the very break of
dawn, the coasts of Greece would be visible. So,
while others slept, I started up at half-past three,
eager to get the earliest possible sight of the land
which still occupies so large a place in our thoughts.
It was a soft gray morning; the sky was covered
with light, broken clouds; the deck was wet with a
passing shower, of which the last drops were still
flying in the air; and before us, some ten miles
away, the coasts and promontories of the Peloponnesus
were reaching southward into the quiet sea.
These long serrated ridges did not look lofty, in
spite of their snow-clad peaks, nor did they look
inhospitable, in spite of their rough outline, but
were all toned in harmonious color—a deep purple
blue, with here and there, on the far Arcadian peaks,
and on the ridge of Mount Taygetus, patches of
pure snow. In contrast to the large sweeps of the
Italian coast, its open seas, its long waves of mountain,
all was here broken, and rugged, and varied.
The sea was studded with rocky islands, and the land
indented with deep, narrow bays. I can never forget
the strong and peculiar impression of that first
sight of Greece; nor can I cease to wonder at the
strange likeness which rose in my mind, and which
<pb n='5'/><anchor id='Pg005'/>made me think of the bays and rocky coasts of
the west and south-west of Ireland. There was
the same cloudy, showery sky, which is so common
there; there was the same serrated outline
of hills, the same richness in promontories, and
rocky islands, and land-locked bays. Nowhere
have I seen a light purple color, except in the wilds
of Kerry and Connemara; and though the general
height of the Greek mountains, as the snow in May
testified, was far greater than that of the Irish
hills, yet on that morning, and in that light, they
looked low and homely, not displaying their grandeur,
or commanding awe and wonder, but rather
attracting the sight by their wonderful grace,
and by their variety and richness of outline and
color.
</p>

<p>
I stood there, I know not how long—without
guide or map—telling myself the name of each
mountain and promontory, and so filling out the idle
names and outlines of many books with the fresh
reality itself. There was the west coast of Elis, as
far north as the eye could reach—the least interesting
part of the view, as it was of the history, of
Greece; then the richer and more varied outline of
Messene, with its bay, thrice famous at great intervals,
and yet for long ages feeding idly on that
fame; Pylos, Sphacteria, Navarino—each a foremost
name in Hellenic history. Above the bay could be
seen those rich slopes which the Spartans coveted of
<pb n='6'/><anchor id='Pg006'/>old, and which, as I saw them, were covered with
golden corn. The three headlands which give to
the Peloponnesus <q>its plane-leaf form,</q><note place="foot">Cf. Strabo, viii. c. 2,
    <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἐστι τοίνυν ἡ Πελοπόννησος ἐοικυῖα φύλλῳ πλατάνου τὸ σχῆμα</foreign>.</note> were as
yet lying parallel before us, and their outline confused;
but the great crowd of heights and intersecting
chains, which told at once the Alpine character
of the peninsula, called to mind the other remark of
the geographer, in which he calls it the Acropolis
of Greece. The words of old Herodotus, too, rise
in the mind with new reality, when he talks of the
poor and stony soil of the country as a <q>rugged
nurse of liberty.</q>
</p>

<p>
For the nearer the ship approaches, the more this
feature comes out; increased, no doubt, greatly in
later days by depopulation and general decay, when
many arable tracts have lain desolate, but still at all
times necessary, when a large proportion of the
country consists of rocky peaks and precipices,
where a goat may graze, but where the eagle builds
secure from the hand of man. The coast, once
teeming with traffic, is now lonely and deserted. A
single sail in the large gulf of Koron, and a few
miserable huts, discernible with a telescope, only
added to the feeling of solitude. It was, indeed,
<q>Greece, but living Greece no more.</q> Even the
pirates, who sheltered in these creeks and moun<pb n='7'/><anchor id='Pg007'/>tains, have abandoned this region, in which there is
nothing now to plunder.<note place="foot">These words were written in 1873. On a later occasion, our
ship was obliged to run into this bay for shelter from a storm,
when we found some cultivation along the coasts, and a village
(Koron), with extensive fortifications above it, said to be Venetian.
The aspect was by no means so desolate as appeared from a passing
view outside the headlands. Coasting steamers now call here
(at Kalamata) every second day.</note>
</p>

<p>
But as we crossed the mouth of the gulf, the eye
fastened with delight on distant white houses along
the high ground of the eastern side—in other words,
along the mountain slopes which run out into the
promontory of Tainaron; and a telescope soon
brought them into distinctness, and gave us the
first opportunity of discussing modern Greek life.
We stood off the coast of Maina—the home of those
Mainotes whom Byron has made so famous as pirates,
as heroes, as lovers, as murderers; and even
now, when the stirring days of war and of piracy have
passed away, the whole district retains the aspect of
a country in a state of siege or of perpetual danger.
Instead of villages surrounded by peaceful homesteads,
each Mainote house, though standing alone,
was walled in, and in the centre was a high square
tower, in which, according to trustworthy travellers,
the Mainote men used to spend their day watching
their enemies, while only the women and children
ventured out to till the fields. For these fierce
mountaineers were not only perpetually defying the
<pb n='8'/><anchor id='Pg008'/>Turkish power, which was never able to subdue them
thoroughly, but they were all engaged at home with
internecine feuds, of which the origin was often forgotten,
but of which the consequences remained in
the form of vengeance due for the life of a kinsman.
When this was exacted on one side, the obligation
changed to the other; and so for generation after generation
they spent their lives in either seeking or
avoiding vengeance. This more than Corsican <hi rend='italic'>vendetta</hi><note place="foot">Which the reader will find best portrayed in Prosper Mérimée’s
<hi rend='italic'>Colomba</hi>.</note>
was, by a sort of mediæval chivalry, prohibited
to the women and children, who were thus
in perfect safety, while their husbands and fathers
were in daily and deadly danger.
</p>

<p>
They are considered the purest in blood of all
the Greeks, though it does not appear that their
dialect approaches old Greek nearer than those of
their neighbors; but for beauty of person, and independence
of spirit, they rank first among the inhabitants
of the Peloponnesus, and most certainly they
must have among them a good deal of the old Messenian
blood. Most of the country is barren, but
there are orange woods, which yield the most delicious
fruit—a fruit so large and rich that it makes
all other oranges appear small and tasteless. The
country is now perfectly safe for visitors, and the
people extremely hospitable, though the diet is not
very palatable to the northern traveller.
</p>

<pb n='9'/><anchor id='Pg009'/>

<p>
So with talk and anecdote about the Mainotes—for
every one was now upon deck and sight-seeing—we
neared the classic headland of Tainaron, almost
the southern point of Europe, once the site of a
great temple of Poseidon—not preserved to us, like
its sister monument on Sunium—and once, too, the
entry to the regions of the dead. And, as if to remind
us of its most beautiful legend, the dolphins,
which had befriended Arion of old, and carried him
here to land, rose in the calm summer sea, and came
playing round the ship, showing their quaint forms
above the water, and keeping with our course, as it
were an escort into the homely seas and islands of
truer Greece. Strangely enough, in many other
journeys through Greek waters, once again only did
we see these dolphins; and here as elsewhere, the
old legend, I suppose, based itself upon the fact that
this, of all their wide domain, was the favorite resort
of these creatures, with which the poets of old
felt so strong a sympathy.
</p>

<p>
But, while the dolphins have been occupying our
attention, we have cleared Cape Matapan, and the
deep Gulf of Asine and Gythium—in fact, the Gulf
of Sparta is open to our view. We strained our
eyes to discover the features of <q>hollow Lacedæmon,</q>
and to take in all the outline of this famous
bay, through which so many Spartans had held their
course in the days of their greatness. The site of
Sparta is far from the sea, probably twelve or fifteen
<pb n='10'/><anchor id='Pg010'/>miles; but the place is marked for every spectator,
throughout all the Peloponnesus and its coasts, by
the jagged top of Mount Taygetus, even in June
covered with snow. Through the forests upon its
slopes the young Spartans would hunt all day with
their famous Laconian hounds, and after a rude
supper beguile the evening with stories of their
dangers and their success. But, as might be expected,
of the five villages which made up the
famous city, few vestiges remain. The old port
of Gythium is still a port; but here, too, the
<q>wet ways,</q> and that sea once covered with boats,
which a Greek comic poet has called the <q>ants of
the sea,</q> have been deserted.
</p>

<p>
We were a motley company on board—Russians,
Greeks, Turks, French, English; and it was not
hard to find pleasant companions and diverting conversation
among them all. I turned to a Turkish
gentleman, who spoke French indifferently. <q>Is it
not,</q> said I, <q>a great pity to see this fair coast so
desolate?</q> <q>A great pity, indeed,</q> said he; <q>but
what can you expect from these Greeks? They are
all pirates and robbers; they are all liars and
knaves. Had the Turks been allowed to hold possession
of the country they would have improved it
and developed its resources; but since the Greeks
became independent everything has gone to ruin.
Roads are broken up, communications abandoned;
<pb n='11'/><anchor id='Pg011'/>the people emigrate and disappear—in fact, nothing
prospers.</q>
</p>

<p>
Presently, I got beside a Greek gentleman, from
whom I was anxiously picking up the first necessary
phrases and politenesses of modern Greek, and, by
way of amusement, put to him the same question.
I got the answer I expected. <q>Ah!</q> said he, <q>the
Turks, the Turks! When I think how these miscreants
have ruined our beautiful country! How
could a land thrive or prosper under such odious
tyranny?</q> I ventured to suggest that the Turks
were now gone five and forty years, and that it was
high time to see the fruits of recovered liberty in
the Greeks. No, it was still too soon. The Turks
had cut down all the woods, and so ruined the
climate; they had destroyed the cities, broken up
the roads, encouraged the bandits—in fact, they had
left the country in such a state that centuries would
not cure it.
</p>

<p>
The verdict of Europe is in favor of the Greek
gentleman; but it might have been suggested, had
we been so disposed, that the greatest and the most
hopeless of all these sorrows—the utter depopulation
of the country—is not due to either modern Greeks
or Turks, nor even to the Slav hordes of the Middle
Ages. It was a calamity which came upon Greece
almost suddenly, immediately after the loss of her
independence, and which historians and phys<pb n='12'/><anchor id='Pg012'/>iologists have as yet been only partially able to
explain.<note place="foot">See the remarks of Polybius, who was himself witness of this
great change, quoted in the last chapter of my <hi rend='italic'>Greek Life and
Thought, from Alexander to the Roman Conquest</hi>.</note>
</p>

<p>
Of this very coast upon which we were then gazing,
the geographer Strabo, about the time of Christ,
says, <q>that of old, Lacedæmon had numbered one
hundred cities; in his day there were but ten remaining.</q>
So, then, the sum of the crimes of both
Greeks and Turks may be diminished by one. But
I, perceiving that each of them would have been
extremely indignant at this historical palliation of
the other’s guilt, <q>kept silence, even from good
words.</q>
</p>

<p>
These dialogues beguiled us till we found ourselves,
almost suddenly, facing the promontory of Malea,
with the island of Cythera (Cerigo) on our right.
The island is little celebrated in history. The
Phœnicians seem, in very old times, to have had a
settlement there for the working of their purple
shell-fishery, for which the coasts of Laconia were
celebrated; and they doubtless founded there the
worship of the Sidonian goddess, who was transformed
by the Greeks into Aphrodite (Venus).
During the Peloponnesian War we hear of the
Athenians using it as a station for their fleet, when
they were ravaging the adjacent coasts. It was, in
fact, used by their naval power as the same sort of
<pb n='13'/><anchor id='Pg013'/>blister (<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἐπιτείχισις</foreign>) on Sparta that Dekelea was when
occupied by the Spartans in Attica.
</p>

<p>
Cape Malea is more famous. It was in olden
days the limit of the homely Greek waters, the bar
to all fair weather and regular winds—a place of
storms and wrecks, and the portal to an inhospitable
open sea; and we can well imagine the delight of
the adventurous trader who had dared to cross the
Western Seas, to gather silver and lead in the mines
of Spain, when he rounded the dreaded Cape, homeward
bound in his heavy-laden ship, and looked
back from the quiet Ægean. The barren and rocky
Cape has its new feature now. On the very extremity
there is a little platform, at some elevation
over the water, and only accessible with great difficulty
from the land by a steep goat-path. Here a
hermit built himself a tiny hut, cultivated his little
plot of corn, and lived out in the lone seas, with no
society but stray passing ships.<note place="foot">We hailed him with a steam whistle in 1886, in vain; so it
may be that he has passed to some newer and more social kind of
life.</note> When Greece was
thickly peopled he might well have been compelled
to seek loneliness here; but now, when in almost any
mountain chain he could find solitude and desolation
enough, it seems as if that poetic instinct which so
often guides the ignorant and unconscious anchorite
had sent him to this spot, which combines, in a
strange way, solitude and publicity, and which ex<pb n='14'/><anchor id='Pg014'/>cites the curiosity, but forbids the intrusion, of every
careless passenger to the East.
</p>

<p>
So we passed into the Ægean, the real thoroughfare
of the Greeks, the mainstay of their communication—a
sea, and yet not a sea, but the frame of
countless headlands and islands, which are ever in
view to give confidence to the sailor in the smallest
boat. The most striking feature in our view was the
serrated outline of the mountains of Crete, far away
to the S. E. Though the day was gray and cloudy,
the atmosphere was perfectly clear, and allowed us to
see these very distant Alps, on which the snow still
lay in great fields. The chain of Ida brought back
to us the old legends of Minos and his island kingdom,
nor could any safer seat of empire be imagined
for a power coming from the south than this
great long bar of mountains, to which half the
islands of the Ægean could pass a fire signal in times
of war or piracy.<note place="foot">A closer view of Crete disclosed to me the interesting fact
that the island is turned to the north, as regards its history. It is
barred on the south by great walls of rock, with hardly any landing-places,
so that all traffic and culture must have started from
the slopes and bays on the north side, where the Cyclades are its
neighbors.</note> The legends preserved to us of
Minos—the human sacrifices to the Minotaur—the
hostility to Theseus—the identification of Ariadne
with the legends of Bacchus, so eastern and orgiastic
in character—make us feel, with a sort of instinctive
certainty, that the power of Minos was
<pb n='15'/><anchor id='Pg015'/>no Hellenic empire, but one of Phœnicians, from
which, as afterwards from Carthage, they commanded
distant coasts and islands, for the purposes
of trade. They settled, as we know, at Corinth, at
Thebes, and probably at Athens, in the days of their
greatness, but they seem always to have been
strangers and sojourners there, while in Crete they
kept the stronghold of their power. Thucydides
thinks that Minos’s main object was to put down
piracy, and protect commerce; and this is probably
the case, though we are without evidence on the point.
The historian evidently regards this old Cretan
empire as the older model of the Athenian, but
settled in a far more advantageous place, and
not liable to the dangers which proved the ruin
of Athens.
</p>

<p>
The nearer islands were small, and of no reputation,
but each like a mountain top reaching out of
a submerged valley, stony and bare. Melos was
farther off, but quite distinct—the old scene of
Athenian violence and cruelty, to Thucydides so
impressive, that he dramatizes the incidents, and
passes from cold narrative and set oration to a
dialogue between the oppressors and the oppressed.
Melian starvation was long proverbial among the
Greeks, and there the fashionable and aristocratic
Alcibiades applied the arguments and carried out
the very policy which the tanner Cleon could not
propose without being pilloried by the great histo<pb n='16'/><anchor id='Pg016'/>rian whom he made his foe. This and other islands,
which were always looked upon by the mainland
Greeks with some contempt, have of late days received
special attention from archæologists. It is
said that the present remains of the old Greek type
are now to be found among the islanders—an observation
which I found fully justified by a short sojourn
at Ægina, where the very types of the Parthenon
frieze can be found among the inhabitants, if the
traveller will look for them diligently. The noblest
and most perfect type of Greek beauty has, indeed,
come to us from Melos, but not in real life. It is
the celebrated Venus of Melos—the most pure and
perfect image we know of that goddess, and one
which puts to shame the lower ideals so much
admired in the museums of Italy.<note place="foot">I should except the splendid <hi rend='italic'>Venus victrix</hi>, as she is called,
found at Capua, and now in the Museum of Naples.</note>
</p>

<p>
Another remark should be made in justice to the
islands, that the groups of Therasia and Santorin,
which lie round the crater of a great active volcano,
have supplied us not only with the oldest forms of
the Greek alphabet in their inscriptions, but with
far the oldest vestiges of inhabitants in any part of
Greece. In these, beneath the lava slopes formed
by a great eruption—an eruption earlier than any
history, except, perhaps, Egyptian—have been found
the dwellings, the implements, and the bones of men
who cannot have lived there much later than 2000
<pb n='17'/><anchor id='Pg017'/><hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi> The arts, as well as the implements, of these
old dwellers in their Stone Age, have shown us how
very ancient Greek forms, and even Greek decorations,
are in the world’s history: and we may yet
from them and from further researches, such as
Schliemann’s, be able to reconstruct the state of
things in Greece before the Greeks came from their
Eastern homes. The special reason why these
inquiries seem to me likely to lead to good result
is this, that what is called neo-barbarism is less likely
to mislead us here than elsewhere. Neo-barbarism
means the occurrence in later times of the manners
and customs which generally mark very old and
primitive times. Some few things of this kind
survive everywhere; thus, in the Irish Island of
Arran, a group of famous <hi rend='italic'>savants</hi> mistook a stone
donkey-shed of two years’ standing for the building
of an extinct race in gray antiquity: as a
matter of fact, the construction had not changed
from the oldest type. But the spread of culture,
and the fulness of population in the good days of
Greece, make it certain that every spot about the
thoroughfares was improved and civilized; and so,
as I have said, there is less chance here than anywhere
of our being deceived into mistaking rudeness
for oldness, and raising a modern savage to the dignity
of a primæval man.
</p>

<p>
But we must not allow speculations to spoil our
observations, nor waste the precious moments given
<pb n='18'/><anchor id='Pg018'/>us to take in once for all the general outline of the
Greek coasts. While the long string of islands,
from Melos up to the point of Attica, framed in
our view to the right, to the left the great bay of
Argolis opened far into the land, making a sort of
vista into the Peloponnesus, so that the mountains
of Arcadia could be seen far to the west standing
out against the setting sun; for the day was now
clearer—the clouds began to break, and let us feel
touches of the sun’s heat towards evening. As we
passed Hydra, the night began to close about us,
and we were obliged to make out the rest of our
geography with the aid of a rich full moon.
</p>

<p>
But these Attic waters, if I may so call them, will
be mentioned again and again in the course of our
voyage, and need not now be described in detail.
The reader will, I think, get the clearest notion of
the size of Greece by reflecting upon the time
required to sail round the Peloponnesus in a good
steamer. The ship in which we made the journey—the
<hi rend='italic'>Donnai</hi>, of the French Messagerie Company,—made
about eight miles an hour. Coming within
close range of the coast of Messene, about five
o’clock in the morning, we rounded all the headlands,
and arrived at the Peiræus about eleven
o’clock the same night. So, then, the Peloponnesus
is a small peninsula, but even to an outside view
<q>very large for its size;</q> for the actual climbing
up and down of constant mountains, in any land
<pb n='19'/><anchor id='Pg019'/>journey from place to place, makes the distance in
miles very much greater than the line as the crow
flies. If I said that every ordinary distance, as
measured on the map, is doubled in the journey,
I believe I should be under the mark.
</p>

<p>
It may be well to add a word here upon the other
route into Greece, that by Brindisi and the Ionian
Islands. It is fully as picturesque, in some respects
more so, for there is no more beautiful bay than the
long fiord leading up to Corinth, which passes Patras,
Vostitza, and Itea, the port of Delphi. The Akrokeraunian
mountains, which are the first point of
the Albanian coast seen by the traveller, are also
very striking, and no one can forget the charms and
beauties of Corfu. I think a market-day in Corfu,
with those royal-looking peasant lads, who come
clothed in sheepskins from the coast, and spend their
day handling knives and revolvers with peculiar
interest at the stalls, is among the most picturesque
sights to be seen in Europe. The lofty mountains
of Ithaca and its greater sister, and then the rich
belt of verdure along the east side of Zante—all
these features make this journey one of surpassing
beauty and interest. Yet notwithstanding all these
advantages, there is not the same excitement in first
approaching semi-Greek or outlying Greek settlements,
and only gradually arriving at the real centres
of historic interest. Such at least was the feeling
(shared by other observers) which I had in approach<pb n='20'/><anchor id='Pg020'/>ing Greece by this more varied route. No traveller,
however, is likely to miss either, as it is obviously
best to enter by one route and depart by the other,
in a voyage not intended to reach beyond Greece.
But from what I have said, it may be seen that I
prefer to enter by the direct route from Naples, and
to leave by the Gulf of Corinth and the Ionian
Islands. I trust that ere long arrangements may
be made for permitting travellers who cross the
isthmus to make an excursion to the Akrokorinthus—the
great citadel of Corinth—which they are now
compelled to hurry past, in order to catch the boat
for Athens.
</p>

<p>
The modern Patras, still a thriving port, is now
the main point of contact between Greece and the
rest of Europe. For, as a railway has now been
opened from Patras to Athens, all the steamers from
Brindisi, Venice, and Trieste put in there, and from
thence the stream of travellers proceeds by the new
line to the capital. The old plan of steaming up the
long fiord to Corinth is abandoned; still more the once
popular route round the Morea, which, if somewhat
slower, at least saved the unshipping at Lechæum,
the drive in omnibuses across the isthmus, and reshipment
at Cenchreæ—all done with much confusion,
and with loss and damage to luggage and temper.
Not that there is no longer confusion. The railway
station at Patras, and that at Athens, are the most
curious bear-gardens in which business ever was
<pb n='21'/><anchor id='Pg021'/>done. The traveller (I speak of the year of our
Lord 1889) is informed that unless he is there an
hour before the time he will not get his luggage
weighed and despatched. And when he comes down
from his comfortable hotel to find out what it all
means, he meets the whole population of the town
in possession of the station. Everybody who has
nothing to do gets in the way of those who have;
everything is full of noise and confusion.
</p>

<p>
At last the train steams out of the station, and
takes its deliberate way along the coast, through
woods of fir trees, bushes of arbutus and mastic,
and the many flowers which stud the earth. And
here already the traveller, looking out of the
window, can form an idea of the delights of real
Greek travel, by which he must understand mounting
a mule or pony, and making his way along
woody paths, or beside the quiet sea, or up the steep
side of a rocky defile. Every half-hour the train
crosses torrents coming from the mountains, which
in flood times color the sea for some distance with
the brilliant brick-red of the clay they carry with
them from their banks. The peacock blue of the
open sea bounds this red water with a definite line,
and the contrast in the bright sun is something very
startling. Shallow banks of sand also reflect their
pale yellow in many places, so that the brilliancy of
this gulf exceeds anything I had ever seen in sea or
lake. We pass the sites of Ægion, now Vostitza,
<pb n='22'/><anchor id='Pg022'/>once famous as the capital or centre (politically) of
the Achæan League. We pass Sicyon, the home
of Aratus, the great regenerator, the mean destroyer
of that League, as you can still read in Plutarch’s fascinating
life of the man. But these places, like so
many others in Greece, once famous, have now no
trace of their greatness left above ground. The day
may, however, still come when another Schliemann
will unearth the records and fragments of a civilization
distinguished even in Greece for refinement.
Sicyon was a famous school of art. Painting and
sculpture flourished there, and there was a special
school of Sicyon, whose features we can still recognize
in extant copies of the famous statues they produced.
There is a statue known as the Canon Statue, a
model of human proportions, which was the work of
the famous Polycleitus of Sicyon, and which we
know from various imitations preserved at Rome
and elsewhere. But we shall return in due time to
Greek sculpture as a whole, and shall not interrupt
our journey at this moment.
</p>

<p>
All that we have passed through hitherto may be
classed under the title of <q>first impressions.</q> The
wild northern coast shows us but one inlet, of the
Gulf of Salona, with a little port of Itea at its
mouth. This was the old highway to ascend to the
oracle of Delphi on the snowy Parnassus, which we
shall approach better from the Bœotian side. But
now we strain our eyes to behold the great rock of
<pb n='23'/><anchor id='Pg023'/>Corinth, and to invade this, the first great centre of
Greek life, which closes the long bay at its westernmost
end.
</p>

<p>
I will add a word upon the form and scope of the
following work. My aim is to bring the living
features of Greece home to the student, by connecting
them, as far as possible, with the facts of older history,
which are so familiar to most of us. I shall also
have a good deal to say about the modern politics of
Greece, and the character of the modern population.
A long and careful survey of the extant literature
of ancient Greece has convinced me that the pictures
usually drawn of the old Greeks are idealized, and
that the real people were of a very different—if you
please, of a much lower—type. I may mention, as
a very remarkable confirmation of my judgment,
that intelligent people at Athens, who had read my
opinions elsewhere set forth upon the subject,<note place="foot">In my <hi rend='italic'>Social Life in Greece, from Homer to Menander</hi>.</note> were
so much struck with the close resemblance of my
pictures of the old Greeks to the present inhabitants,
that they concluded that I must have visited the
country before writing these opinions, and that I
was, in fact, drawing my classical people from the
life of the moderns. If this is not a proof of the
justice of these views, it at least strongly suggests
that they may be true, and is a powerful support in
arguing the matter on the perfectly independent
ground of the inferences from old literature. After
<pb n='24'/><anchor id='Pg024'/>all, national characteristics are very permanent, and
very hard to shake off, and it would seem strange,
indeed, if both these and the Greek language should
have remained almost intact, and yet the race have
either changed, or been saturated with foreign blood.
Foreign invasions and foreign conquests of Greece
were common enough; but here, as elsewhere, the
climate and circumstances which have formed a race
seem to conspire to preserve it, and to absorb foreign
types and features, rather than to permit the extinction
or total change of the older race.
</p>

<p>
I feel much fortified in my judgment of Greek
character by finding that a very smart, though too
sarcastic, observer, M. E. About, in his well-known
<hi rend='italic'>Grèce contemporaine</hi>, estimates the people very
nearly as I am disposed to estimate the common
people of ancient Greece. He notices, in the
second and succeeding chapters of his book, a
series of features which make this nationality a very
distinct one in Europe. Starting from the question
of national beauty, and holding rightly that the
beauty of the men is greater than that of the women,
he touches on a point which told very deeply upon
all the history of Greek art. At the present day,
the Greek men are much more particular about their
appearance, and more vain of it, than the women.
The most striking beauty among them is that of
young men; and as to the care of figure, as About
well observes, in Greece it is the men who pinch
<pb n='25'/><anchor id='Pg025'/>their waists—a fashion unknown among Greek
women. Along with this handsome appearance, the
people are, without doubt, a very temperate people;
although they make a great deal of strong wine,
they seldom drink much, and are far more critical
about good water than wine. Indeed, in so warm a
climate, wine is disagreeable even to the northern
traveller; and, as Herodotus remarked long ago,
very likely to produce insanity, the rarest form of
disease among the Greeks. In fact, they are not
a passionate race—having at all ages been gifted
with a very bright intellect, and a great reasonableness;
they have an intellectual insight into
things, which is inconsistent with the storms of
wilder passion.
</p>

<p>
They are, probably, as clever a people as can be
found in the world, and fit for any mental work
whatever. This they have proved, not only by getting
into their hands all the trade of the Eastern
Mediterranean, but by holding their own perfectly
among English merchants in England. As yet they
have not found any encouragement in other directions;
but there can be no doubt that, if settled
among a great people, and weaned from the follies
and jealousies of Greek politics, they would (like
the Jews) outrun many of us, both in politics and in
science. However that may be—and perhaps such
a development requires moral qualities in which
they seem deficient—it is certain that their work<pb n='26'/><anchor id='Pg026'/>men learn trades with extraordinary quickness;
while their young commercial or professional men
acquire languages, and the amount of knowledge
necessary for making money, with the most singular
aptness. But as yet they are stimulated chiefly by
the love of gain.
</p>

<p>
Besides this, they have great national pride, and,
as M. About remarks, we need never despair of a
people who are at the same time intelligent and
proud. They are very fond of displaying their
knowledge on all points—I noted especially their
pride in exhibiting their acquaintance with old Greek
history and legend. When I asked them whether
they believed the old mythical stories which they
repeated, they seemed afraid of being thought simple
if they confessed that they did, and of injuring the
reputation of their ancestors if they declared they
did not. So they used to preserve a discreet neutrality.
</p>

<p>
The instinct of liberty appears to me as strong in
the nation now as it ever was. In fact, the people
have never been really enslaved. The eternal refuge
for liberty afforded by the sea and the mountains
has saved them from this fate; and, even
beneath the heavy yoke of the Turks, a large part
of the nation was not subdued, but, in the guise of
bandits and pirates, enjoyed the great privilege for
which their ancestors had contended so earnestly.
The Mainotes, for example, of whom I have just
<pb n='27'/><anchor id='Pg027'/>spoken as occupying the coast of Messene, never
tolerated any resident Turkish magistrate among
them, but <q>handed to a trembling tax-collector a
little purse of gold pieces, hung on the end of a
naked sword.</q><note place="foot">The words are M. About’s.</note> Now, the whole nation is more intensely
and thoroughly democratic than any other in
Europe. They acknowledge no nobility save that
of descent from the chiefs who fought in the war of
liberation; they will allow no distinction of classes;
every common mule-boy is a gentleman (<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">κύριος</foreign>), and
fully your equal. He sits in the room at meals, and
joins in the conversation at dinner. They only
tolerate a king because they cannot endure one of
themselves as their superior. This jealousy is, unfortunately,
a mainspring of Greek politics, and
when combined with a dislike of agriculture, as a
stupid and unintellectual occupation, fills all the
country with politicians, merchants, and journalists.
Moreover, they want the spirit of subordination of
their great ancestors, and are often accused of lack
of honesty—a very grave feature, and the greatest
obstacle to progress in all ages. It is better, however,
to let points of character come out gradually
in the course of our studies than to bring them together
into an official portrait. It is impossible to
wander through the country without seeing and
understanding the inhabitants; for the traveller is
<pb n='28'/><anchor id='Pg028'/>in constant contact with them, and they have no
scruple in displaying all their character.
</p>

<p>
M. About has earned the profound hatred and
contempt of the nation by his picture, and I do not
wonder at it, seeing that the tone in which he writes
is flippant and ill-natured, and seems to betoken
certain private animosities, of which the Greeks tell
numerous anecdotes.
</p>

<p>
I have no such excuse for being severe or ill-natured,
as I found nothing but kindness and hospitality
everywhere, and sincerely hope that my free
judgments may not hurt any sensitive Greek who
may chance to see them. Even the great Finlay—one
of their best friends—is constantly censured by
them for his writings about Modern Greece.
</p>

<p>
But, surely, any real lover of Greece must feel
that plain speaking about the faults of the nation is
much wanted. The worship lavished upon them by
Byron and his school has done its good, and can now
only do harm. On the other hand, I must confess
that a longer and more intimate intercourse with the
Greeks of the interior and of the mountains leads a
fair observer to change his earlier estimate, and
think more highly of the nation than at first acquaintance.
Unfortunately, the Greeks known to
most of us are sailors—mongrel villains from the ports
of the Levant, having very little in common with the
bold, honest, independent peasant who lives under
his vine and his fig-tree in the valleys of Arcadia
<pb n='29'/><anchor id='Pg029'/>or of Phocis. It was, no doubt, an intimate knowledge
of the sound core of the nation which inspired
Byron with that enthusiasm which many now think
extravagant and misplaced. But here, as elsewhere,
the folly of a great genius has more truth in
it than the wisdom of his feebler critics.

<head type="sub">GENERAL IMPRESSIONS OF ATHENS AND ATTICA.</head>

<p>
There is probably no more exciting voyage, to
any educated man, than the approach to Athens
from the sea. Every promontory, every island,
every bay, has its history. If he knows the map of
Greece, he needs no guide-book or guide to distract
him; if he does not, he needs little Greek to ask of
any one near him the name of this or that object;
and the mere names are sufficient to stir up all his
classical recollections. But he must make up his
mind not to be shocked at <hi rend='italic'>Ægina</hi> or <hi rend='italic'>Phalerum</hi>, and
even to be told that he is utterly wrong in his way
of pronouncing them.
</p>

<p>
It was our fortune to come into Greece by night,
with a splendid moon shining upon the summer sea.
The varied outlines of Sunium on the one side, and
Ægina on the other, were very clear, but in the deep
shadows there was mystery enough to feed the burning
impatience to see it all in the light of common
day; and though we had passed Ægina, and had
come over against the rocky Salamis, as yet there
was no sign of Peiræus. Then came the light on
Psyttalea, and they told us that the harbor was right
<pb n='31'/><anchor id='Pg031'/>opposite. Yet we came nearer and nearer, and no
harbor could be seen. The barren rocks of the
coast seemed to form one unbroken line, and nowhere
was there a sign of indentation or of break in the
land. But, suddenly, as we turned from gazing on
Psyttalea, where the flower of the Persian nobles
had once stood in despair, looking upon their fate
gathering about them, the vessel had turned eastward,
and discovered to us the crowded lights and
thronging ships of the famous harbor. Small it
looked, very small, but evidently deep to the water’s
edge, for great ships seemed touching the shore;
and so narrow is the mouth that we almost wondered
how they had made their entrance in safety.
But we saw it some weeks later, with nine men-of-war
towering above all its merchant shipping
and its steamers, and among them crowds of
ferry-boats skimming about in the breeze with their
wing-like sails. Then we found out that, like the
rest of Greece, the Peiræus was far larger than it
looked.

<p>
It differed little, alas! from more vulgar harbors
in the noise and confusion of disembarking; in the
delays of its custom house; in the extortion and
insolence of its boatmen. It is still, as in Plato’s
day, <q>the haunt of sailors, where good manners are
unknown.</q> But when we had escaped the turmoil,
and were seated silently on the way to Athens,
almost along the very road of classical days, all our
<pb n='32'/><anchor id='Pg032'/>classical notions, which had been scared away by
vulgar bargaining and protesting, regained their
sway. We had sailed in through the narrow passage
where almost every great Greek that ever
lived had sometime passed; now we went along the
line, hardly less certain, which had seen all these
great ones going to and fro between the city and the
port. The present road is shaded with great silver
poplars and plane trees, and the moon had set, so that
our approach to Athens was even more mysterious
than our approach to the Peiræus. We were, moreover,
perplexed at our carriage stopping under some
large plane trees, though we had driven but two
miles, and the night was far spent. Our coachman
would listen to no advice or persuasion. We learned
afterwards that every carriage going to and from the
Peiræus stops at this half-way house, that the horses
may drink, and the coachman take <q>Turkish delight</q>
and water. There is no exception made to
this custom, and the traveller is bound to submit.
At last we entered the unpretending ill-built streets
at the west of Athens.
</p>

<p>
The stillness of the night is a phenomenon hardly
known in that city. No sooner have men and
horses gone to rest than all the dogs and cats of the
town come out to bark and yell about the thoroughfares.
Athens, like all parts of modern Greece,
abounds in dogs. You cannot pass a sailing boat
in the Levant without seeing a dog looking angrily
<pb n='33'/><anchor id='Pg033'/>over the taffrail, and barking at you as you pass.
Every ship in the Peiræus has at least one, often a
great many, on board. I suppose every house in
Athens is provided with one. These creatures
seem to make it their business to prevent silence
and rest all the night long. They were ably
seconded by cats and crowing cocks, as well as by
an occasional wakeful donkey; and both cats and
donkeys seemed to have voices of almost tropical
violence.
</p>

<p>
So the night wore away under rapidly growing
adverse impressions. How is a man to admire art
and revere antiquity if he is robbed of his repose?
The Greeks sleep so much in the day that they
seem indifferent about nightly disturbances; and,
perhaps, after many years’ habit, even Athenian
caterwauling may fail to rouse the sleeper. But
what chance has the passing traveller? Even the
strongest ejaculations are but a narrow outlet for his
feelings.
</p>

<p>
In this state of mind, then, I rose at the break of
dawn to see whether the window would afford any
prospect to serve as a requital for angry sleeplessness.
And there, right opposite, stood the rock which of
all rocks in the world’s history has done most
for literature and art—the rock which poets, and
orators, and architects, and historians have ever
glorified, and cannot stay their praise—which is
ever new and ever old, ever fresh in its decay, ever
<pb n='34'/><anchor id='Pg034'/>perfect in its ruin, ever living in its death—the
Acropolis of Athens.
</p>

<p>
When I saw my dream and longing of many years
fulfilled, the first rays of the rising sun had just
touched the heights, while the town below was still
hid in gloom. Rock, and rampart, and ruined fanes—all
were colored in uniform tints; the lights were
of a deep rich orange, and the shadows of dark
crimson, with the deeper lines of purple. There
was no variety in color between what nature and
what man had set there. No whiteness shone from
the marble, no smoothness showed upon the hewn
and polished blocks; but the whole mass of orange
and crimson stood out together into the pale, pure
Attic air. There it stood, surrounded by lanes and
hovels, still perpetuating the great old contrast in
Greek history, of magnificence and meanness—of
loftiness and lowness—as well in outer life as in inward
motive. And, as it were in illustration of that
art of which it was the most perfect bloom, and
which lasted in perfection but a day of history, I saw
it again and again, in sunlight and in shade, in daylight
and at night, but never again in this perfect
and singular beauty.
</p>

<p>
If we except the Acropolis, there are only two
striking buildings of classical antiquity within the
modern town of Athens—the Temple of Theseus and
the few standing columns of Hadrian’s great temple
to Zeus. The latter is, indeed, very remarkable.
<pb n='35'/><anchor id='Pg035'/>The pillars stand on a vacant platform, once the site
of the gigantic temple; the Acropolis forms a noble
background; away towards Phalerum stretch undulating
hills which hide the sea; to the left (if we
look from the town), Mount Hymettus raises its
barren slopes; and in the valley, immediately below
the pillars, flows the famous little Ilisus,<note place="foot">I beg to point out to a learned and kindly critic in the
<hi rend='italic'>Athenæum</hi>, who corrected several faults of spelling in the first
edition, that this is the form of the name warranted by inscriptions,
and now to be received by scholars: cf. Wachsmuth’s <hi rend='italic'>Stadt
Athen</hi>, i. p. 49.</note> glorified
for ever by the poetry of Plato, and in its summer-dry
bed the fountain Callirrhoe, from which the
Athenian maidens still draw water as of old—water
the purest and best in the city. It wells out from
under a great limestone rock, all plumed with the
rich <hi rend='italic'>Capillus Veneris</hi>, which seems to find out and
frame with its delicate green every natural spring
in Greece.
</p>

<p>
But the pillars of the Temple of Zeus, though
very stately and massive, and with their summits
bridged together by huge blocks of architrave, are
still not Athenian, not Attic, not (if I may say so)
genuine Greek work; for the Corinthian capitals,
which are here seen perhaps in their greatest perfection,
cannot be called pure Greek taste. As is
well known, they were hardly ever used, and never
used prominently, till the Græco-Roman stage of
<pb n='36'/><anchor id='Pg036'/>art. The older Greeks seem to have had a fixed
objection to intricate ornamentation in their larger
temples. All the greater temples of Greece and
Greek Italy are of the Doric Order, with its perfectly
plain capital. Groups of figures were admitted
upon the pediments and metopes, because
these groups formed clear and massive designs
visible from a distance. But such intricacies as
those of the Corinthian capital were not approved,
except in small monuments, which were merely
intended for close inspection, and where delicate
ornament gave grace to a building which could not
lay claim to grandeur. Such is clearly the case with
the only purely Greek (as opposed to Græco-Roman)
monument of the Corinthian Order, which is still
standing—the Choragic monument of Lysicrates at
Athens.<note place="foot">This beautiful monument has been so defaced and mutilated
that the photographs of to-day give no idea of its decoration.
The careful drawings and restorations of Stuart and Revett were
made in the last century, when it was still comparatively intact,
and it is through their book alone that we can now estimate the
merits of many of the ancient buildings of Athens. It should be
added that there was a solitary Corinthian capital found in the
temple of Bassæ, which I will describe in another chapter. But
this still affords an unsolved problem. The Philippeion at Olympia
(built by the famous Philip of Macedon) also contained an inner
circle of Corinthian pillars, while the outer circle was Ionic.</note> It was also the case with that beautiful
little temple, or group of temples, known as the
Erechtheum, which, standing beside the great massive
Parthenon on the Acropolis of Athens, presents
<pb n='37'/><anchor id='Pg037'/>the very contrasts upon which I am insisting. It is
small and essentially graceful, being built in the
Ionic style, with rich ornamentation; while the
Parthenon is massive, and, in spite of much ornamentation,
very severe in its plainer Doric style.

<p>
But to return to the pillars of Hadrian’s Temple.
They are about fifty-five feet high, by six and a
half feet in diameter, and no Corinthian pillar of
this colossal size would ever have been set up by
the Greeks in their better days. So, then, in spite
of the grandeur of these isolated remains—a grandeur
not destroyed, perhaps even not diminished, by coffee
tables, and inquiring waiters, and military bands,
and a vulgar crowd about their base—to the student
of really Greek art they are not of the highest
interest; nay, they even suggest to him what the
Periclean Greeks would have done had they, with
such resources, completed the great temple due to
the munificence of the Roman Emperor.
</p>

<p>
Let us turn, in preference, to the Temple of
Theseus, at the opposite extremity of the town, it
too standing upon a clear platform, and striking the
traveller with its symmetry and its completeness, as
he approaches from the Peiræus. It is in every
way a contrast to the temple of which we have just
spoken. It is very small—in fact so small in comparison
with the Parthenon, or the great temple at
Pæstum, that we are disappointed with it; and yet
it is built, not in the richly-decorated Ionic style of
<pb n='38'/><anchor id='Pg038'/>the Erechtheum, but in severe Doric; and though
small and plain, it is very perfect—as perfect as any
such relic that we have. It is many centuries older
than Hadrian’s great temple. It could have been
destroyed with one-tenth of the trouble, and yet it
still stands almost in its perfection. The reason is
simply this. Few of the great classical temples
suffered much from wanton destruction till the
Middle Ages. Now, in the Middle Ages this
temple, as well as the Parthenon, was usurped by
the Greek Church, and turned into a place of
Christian worship. So, then, the little Temple of
Theseus has escaped the ravages which the last few
centuries—worse than all that went before—have
made in the remains of a noble antiquity. To
those who desire to study the effect of the Doric
Order this temple appears to me an admirable specimen.
From its small size and clear position, all its
points are very easily taken in. <q>Such,</q> says Bishop
Wordsworth, <q>is the integrity of its structure, and
the distinctness of its details, that it requires no
description beyond that which a few glances might
supply. Its beauty defies all: its solid yet graceful
form is, indeed, admirable; and the loveliness of
its coloring is such that, from the rich mellow hue
which the marble has now assumed, it looks as if it
had been quarried, not from the bed of a rocky mountain,
but from the golden light of an Athenian sunset.</q>
And in like terms many others have spoken.
</p>

<pb n='39'/><anchor id='Pg039'/>

<p>
I have only one reservation to make. The Doric
Order being essentially massive, it seems to me that
this beautiful temple lacks one essential feature of
that order, and therefore, after the first survey, after
a single walk about it, it loses to the traveller who
has seen Pæstum, and who presently cannot fail to
see the Parthenon, that peculiar effect of massiveness—of
almost Egyptian solidity—which is ever
present, and ever imposing, in these huger Doric
temples. It seems as if the Athenians themselves
felt this—that the plain simplicity of its style was
not effective without size—and accordingly decorated
this structure with colors more richly than their
other temples. All the reliefs and raised ornaments
seem to have been painted; other decorations were
added in color on the flat surfaces, so that the whole
temple must have been a mass of rich variegated
hues, of which blue, green, and red are still distinguishable—or
were in Stuart’s time—and in
which bronze and gilding certainly played an important
part.
</p>

<p>
We are thus brought naturally face to face with
one of the peculiarities of old Greek art most difficult
to realize, and still more to appreciate.<note place="foot">The following remarks on the polychromy of Greek art are
not intended for Professors of Fine Art, to whom, indeed, few
things in this book, if true, can be new, but for the ordinary
reader, who may not have seen it discussed elsewhere.</note> We
can recognize in Egyptian and in Assyrian art the
<pb n='40'/><anchor id='Pg040'/>richness and appropriateness of much coloring.
Modern painters are becoming so alive to this, that
among the most striking pictures in our Royal
Academy in London have been seen, for some years
back, scenes from old Egyptian and Assyrian life, in
which the rich coloring of the architecture has been
quite a prominent feature.
</p>

<p>
But in Greek art—in the perfect symmetry of the
Greek temple, in the perfect grace of the Greek
statue—we come to think form of such paramount
importance, that we look on the beautiful Parian and
Pentelic marbles as specially suited for the expression
of form apart from color. There is even something
in unity of tone that delights the modern eye.
Thus, though we feel that the old Greek temples
have lost all their original brightness, yet, as I have
myself said, and as I have quoted from Bishop
Wordsworth, the rich mellow hue which tones all
these ruins has to us its peculiar charm. The same
rich yellow brown, almost the color of the Roman
travertine, is one of the most striking features in the
splendid remains which have made Pæstum unique
in all Italy. This color contrasts beautifully with
the blue sky of southern Europe; it lights up with
extraordinary richness in the rising or setting sun.
We can easily conceive that were it proposed to
restore the Attic temples to their pristine whiteness,
we should feel a severe shock, and beg to have these
venerable buildings left in the soberness of their
<pb n='41'/><anchor id='Pg041'/>acquired color. Still more does it shock us to be
told that great sculptors, with Parian marble at
hand, preferred to set up images of the gods in gold
and ivory, or, still worse, with parts of gold and
ivory; and that they thought it right to fill out the
eyes with precious stones, and set gilded wreaths
upon colored hair.
</p>

<p>
When we first come to realize these things, we
are likely to exclaim against such a jumble, as we
should call it, of painting and architecture—still
worse, of painting and sculpture. Nor is it possible
or reasonable that we should at once submit to such
a revolution in our artistic ideas, and bow without
criticism to these shocking features in Greek art.
But if blind obedience to these our great masters in
the laws of beauty is not to be commended, neither
is an absolute resistance to all argument on the
question to be respected; nor do I acknowledge the
good sense or the good taste of that critic who insists
that nothing can possibly equal the color and texture
of white marble, and that all coloring of such a substance
is the mere remains of barbarism. For, say
what we will, the Greeks were certainly, as a nation,
the best judges of beauty the world has yet seen.
And this is not all. The beauty of which they were
evidently the most fond was beauty of form—harmony
of proportions, symmetry of design. They
always hated the tawdry and the extravagant. As
to their literature, there is no poetry, no oratory, no
<pb n='42'/><anchor id='Pg042'/>history, which is less decorated with the flowers of
rhetoric: it is all pure in design, chaste in detail.
So with their dress; so with their dwellings. We
cannot but feel that, had the effect of painted temples
and statues been tawdry, there is no people on earth
who would have felt it so keenly, and disliked it so
much. There must, then, have been strong reasons
why this bright coloring did not strike their eye as
it would the eye of sober moderns.
</p>

<p>
To any one who has seen the country, and thought
about the question there, many such reasons present
themselves. In the first place, all through southern
Europe, and more especially in Greece, there is an
amount of bright color in nature, which prevents
almost any artificial coloring from producing a startling
effect. Where all the landscape, the sea, and
the air are exceedingly bright, we find the inhabitants
increasing the brightness of their dress and
houses, as it were to correspond with nature. Thus,
in Italy, they paint their houses green, and pink,
and yellow, and so give to their towns and villas
that rich and warm effect which we miss so keenly
among the gray and sooty streets of northern
Europe. So also in their dress, these people wear
scarlet, and white, and rich blue, not so much in
patterns as in large patches, and a festival in Sicily
or Greece fills the streets with intense color. We
know that the coloring of the old Greek dress was
quite of the same character as that of the modern,
<pb n='43'/><anchor id='Pg043'/>though in design it has completely changed. We
must, therefore, imagine the old Greek crowd before
their temples, or in their market-places, a very white
crowd, with patches of scarlet and various blue;
perhaps altogether white in processions, if we except
scarlet shoe-straps and other such slight relief. One
cannot but feel that a richly colored temple—that
pillars of blue and red—that friezes of gilding, and
other ornament, upon a white marble ground, and in
white marble framing, must have been a splendid
and appropriate background, a genial feature, in
such a sky and with such costume. We must get
accustomed to such combinations—we must dwell
upon them in imagination, or ask our good painters
to restore them for us, and let us look upon them
constantly and calmly.
</p>

<p>
But I will not seek to persuade; let us merely
state the case fairly, and put the reader in a position
to judge for himself. So much for the painted
architecture. I will but add, the most remarkable
specimen of a richly painted front to which we can
now appeal is also really one of the most beautiful
in Europe—the front of S. Mark’s at Venice. The
rich frescoes and profuse gilding on this splendid
front, of which photographs give a very false idea,
should be studied by all who desire to judge fairly
of this side of Greek taste.
</p>

<p>
But I must say a word, before passing on, concerning
the statues. No doubt, the painting of
<pb n='44'/><anchor id='Pg044'/>statues, and the use of gold and ivory upon them,
were derived from a rude age, when no images
existed but rude wooden work—at first a mere
block, then roughly altered and reduced to shape,
probably requiring some coloring to produce any
effect whatever. To a public accustomed from
childhood to such painted, and often richly dressed
images, a pure white marble statue must appear
utterly cold and lifeless. So it does to us, when we
have become accustomed to the mellow tints of old
and even weather-stained Greek statues; and it
should be here noticed that this mellow skin-surface
on antique statues is not the mere result of age, but
of an artificial process, whereby they burnt into the
surface a composition of wax and oil, which gave a
yellowish tone to the marble, as well as also that
peculiar surface which so accurately represents the
texture of the human skin. But if we imagine all
the marble surfaces and reliefs in the temple colored
for architectural richness’ sake, we can feel even
more strongly how cold and out-of-place would be
a perfectly colorless statue in the centre of all this
pattern.
</p>

<p>
I will go further, and say we can point out cases
where coloring greatly heightens the effect and
beauty of sculpture. The first is from the bronzes
found at Herculaneum, now in the museum at
Naples. Though they are not marble, they are
suitable for our purpose, being naturally of a single
<pb n='45'/><anchor id='Pg045'/>dark brown hue, which is indeed even more unfavorable
(we should think) for such treatment. In
some of the finest of these bronzes—especially in
the two young men starting for a race—the eyeballs
are inserted in white, with iris and pupil colored.
Nothing can be conceived more striking and lifelike
than the effect produced. There is in the Varvakion
at Athens a marble mask, found in the Temple of
Æsculapius under the south side of the Acropolis,
probably an <hi rend='italic'>ex voto</hi> offered for a recovery from some
disease of the eyes. This marble face also has its
eyes colored in the most striking and lifelike way,
and is one of the most curious objects found in the
late excavations.
</p>

<p>
I will add one remarkable modern example—the
monument at Florence to a young Indian prince,
who visited England and this country some years
ago, and died of fever during his homeward voyage.
They have set up to him a richly colored and gilded
baldachin, in the open air, and in a quiet, wooded
park. Under this covering is a life-sized bust of
the prince, in his richest state dress. The whole
bust—the turban, the face, the drapery—all is colored
to the life, and the dress, of course, of the most
gorgeous variety. The turban is chiefly white,
striped with gold, in strong contrast to the mahogany
complexion and raven hair of the actual head;
the robe is gold and green, and covered with ornament.
The general effect is, from the very first
<pb n='46'/><anchor id='Pg046'/>moment, striking and beautiful. The longer it is
studied, the better it appears; and there is hardly a
reasonable spectator who will not confess that, were
we to replace the present bust with a copy of it in
white marble, the beauty and harmony of the monument
would be utterly marred. To those who have
the opportunity of visiting Greece or Italy, I
strongly commend these specimens of colored buildings
and sculpture. When they have seen them,
they will hesitate to condemn what we still hear
called the curiously bad taste of the old Greeks in
their use of color in the plastic arts.
</p>

<p>
But these archæological discussions are truly
<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἐκβολαὶ λόγου</foreign>, digressions—in themselves necessary,
yet only tolerable if they are not too long. I revert
to the general state of the antiquities at Athens,
always reserving the Acropolis for a special chapter.
As I said, the isolated pillars of Hadrian’s Temple
of Zeus, and the so-called Temple of Theseus, are
the only very striking objects.<note place="foot">By the way, the appellation <q>Temple of Theseus</q> is more
than doubtful. The building fronts towards the east. This is
proved by the greater size and more elaborate decoration of the
eastern portal. It is almost certain, according to an old scholion
on Pindar, that the temples of heroes like Theseus faced west,
while those only of the Olympian gods faced the rising sun. The
temple, therefore, was the temple, not of a hero, but of a god.
Probably the Temple of Heracles, worshipped as a <hi rend='italic'>god</hi> at Athens,
which is mentioned in the scholia of Aristophanes as situated in
this part of Athens, is to be identified with the building in question.
But I suppose for years to come we must be content to abide
by the old name of Theseon, which is now too long in general use
to be easily disturbed.</note> There are, of
<pb n='47'/><anchor id='Pg047'/>course, many other buildings, or remains of buildings.
There is the monument of Lysicrates—a
small and very graceful round chamber, adorned
with Corinthian engaged pillars, and with friezes
of the school of Scopas, and intended to carry on its
summit the tripod Lysicrates had gained in a musical
and dramatic contest (334 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>) at Athens. There
is the later Temple of the Winds, as it is called—a
sort of public clock, with sundials and fine reliefs
of the Wind-gods on its outward surfaces, and arrangements
for a water-clock within. There are
two portals, or gateways—one leading into the old
agora, or market-place, the other leading from old
Athens into the Athens of Hadrian.
</p>

<p>
But all these buildings are either miserably defaced,
or of such late date and decayed taste as to
make them unworthy specimens of pure Greek art.
A single century ago there was much to be seen and
admired which has since disappeared; and even
to-day the majority of the population are careless
as to the treatment of ancient monuments, and sometimes
even mischievous in wantonly defacing them.
Thus, I saw the marble tombs of Ottfried Müller
and Charles Lenormant—tombs which, though modern,
were yet erected at the cost of the nation to
men who were eminent lovers and students of Greek
art—I saw these tombs used as common targets by
<pb n='48'/><anchor id='Pg048'/>the neighborhood, and all peppered with marks of
shot and of bullets. I saw them, too, all but blown
up by workmen blasting for building-stones close
beside them.<note place="foot">I was since informed at Athens that this complaint had not
been without results, and that steps are being taken to prevent
quarrying at random on classical sites.</note> I saw, also, from the Acropolis, a
young gentleman practising with a pistol at a piece
of old carved marble work in the Theatre of Dionysus.
His object seemed to be to chip off a piece
from the edge at every shot. Happily, on this occasion,
our vantage ground enabled us to take the law
into our own hands; and after in vain appealing to
a custodian to interfere, we adopted the tactics of
Apollo at Delphi, and by detaching stones from the
top of our precipice, we put to flight the wretched
barbarian who had come to ravage the treasures of
that most sacred place.
</p>

<p>
These unhappy examples of the defacing of architectural
monuments,<note place="foot">Even the marble statue set up to the patriot Botzari over the
grave of the heroes of Missolonghi was so mutilated by the inhabitants
that the authorities have removed it from mere shame.</note> which can hardly be removed,
naturally suggest to the traveller in Greece the
kindred question how all the smaller and movable
antiquities that are found should be distributed
so as best to promote the love and knowledge of
art.
</p>

<p>
On this point it seems to me that we have gone
to one extreme, and the Greeks to the other, and
<pb n='49'/><anchor id='Pg049'/>that neither of us have done our best to make known
what we acknowledge ought to be known as widely
as possible. The tendency in England, at least of
later years, has been to swallow up all lesser and all
private collections in the great national Museum in
London, which has accordingly become so enormous
and so bewildering that no one can profit by it except
the trained specialist, who goes in with his eyes
shut, and will not open them till he has arrived at
the special class of objects he intends to examine.
But to the ordinary public, and even the generally
enlightened public (if such an expression be not a
contradiction in terms), there is nothing so utterly
bewildering, and therefore so unprofitable, as a visit
to the myriad treasures of that great world of curiosities.
</p>

<p>
In the last century many private persons—many
noblemen of wealth and culture—possessed remarkable
collections of antiquities. These have
mostly been swallowed up by what is called <q>the
nation,</q> and new private collections are very rare
indeed.
</p>

<p>
In Greece the very opposite course is being now
pursued. By a special law it is forbidden to sell out
of the country, or even to remove from a district,
any antiquities whatever; and in consequence little
museums have been established in every village in
Greece—nay, sometimes even in places where there
is no village, in order that every district may
pos<pb n='50'/><anchor id='Pg050'/>sess its own riches, and become worth a visit from
the traveller and the antiquary. I have seen such
museums at Eleusis, some fifteen miles from Athens,
at Thebes, now an unimportant town, at Livadia, at
Chæronea, at Argos, at Olympia, and even in the
wild plains of Orchomenus, in a little chapel, with
no town within miles.<note place="foot">It is fair to add that an exception has been made for the discoveries
at Mycenæ, which have been almost all brought to
Athens; and that a handsome museum has now been built at
Olympia, and a good road from Pyrgos, which has a railway to
the sea.</note> If I add to this that most of
these museums were mere dark outhouses, only
lighted through the door, the reader will have some
notion what a task it would be to visit and criticise,
with any attempt at completeness, the ever-increasing
remnants of classical Greece.
</p>

<p>
The traveller is at first disposed to complain that
even the portable antiquities found in various parts
of Greece are not brought to Athens, and gathered
into one vast national museum. Further reflection
shows such a proceeding to be not only impossible,
but highly inexpedient. I will not speak of the
great waste of objects of interest when they are
brought together in such vast masses that the visitor
is rather oppressed than enlightened. Any one who
has gone to the British Museum will know what I
mean. Nor will I give the smallest weight to the
selfish local argument, that compelling visitors to
<pb n='51'/><anchor id='Pg051'/>wander from place to place brings traffic and money
into the country. Until proper roads and clean inns
are established, such an argument is both unfair and
unlikely to produce results worth considering. But
fortunately most of the famous things in Greece are
sites, ruined buildings, forts which cannot be removed
from their place, if at all, without destruction,
and of which the very details cannot be understood
without seeing the place for which they were
intended. Even the Parthenon sculptures in London
would have lost most of their interest, if the
building itself at Athens did not show us their application,
and glorify them with its splendor. He
who sees the gold of Mycenæ at Athens, knows little
of its meaning, if he has not visited the giant forts
where its owners once dwelt and exercised their
sway; and if, as has been done at Olympia, some
patriotic Greek had built a safe museum at Mycenæ
to contain them, they would be more deeply interesting
and instructive than they now are.
</p>

<p>
In such a town as Athens, on the contrary, it
seems to me that the true solution of the problem
has been attained, though it will probably be shortly
abandoned for a central museum. There are (or
were) at Athens at least six separate museums of
antiquities—one at the University, one called the
Varvakion, one in the Theseum, one, or rather two,
on the Acropolis, one in the Ministry of Public Instruction,
and lastly, the new National Museum,
<pb n='52'/><anchor id='Pg052'/>as it is called, in Patissia Street—devoted to its
special treasures. If these several storehouses were
thoroughly kept,—if the objects were carefully numbered
and catalogued,—I can conceive no better
arrangement for studying separately and in detail
the various monuments, which must always bewilder
and fatigue when crowded together in one vast exhibition.
If the British Museum were in this way
severed into many branches, and the different classes
of objects it contains were placed in separate buildings,
and in different parts of London, I believe
most of us would acquire a far greater knowledge
of what it contains, and hence it would attain a
greater usefulness in educating the nation. To visit
any one of the Athenian museums is a comparatively
short and easy task, where a man can see the
end of his labor before him, and hence will not hesitate
to delay long over such things as are worth a
careful study.
</p>

<p>
It may be said that all this digression about the
mere placing of monuments is delaying the reader
too long from what he desires to know—something
about the monuments themselves. But this little
book, to copy an expression of Herodotus, particularly
affects digressions. I desire to wander through
the subject exactly in the way which naturally suggests
itself to me. After all, the reflections on a
journey ought to be more valuable than its mere
description.
</p>

<pb n='53'/><anchor id='Pg053'/>

<p>
Before passing into Attica and leaving Athens,
something more must, of course, be said of the museums,
then of the newer diggings, and especially
of the splendid tombs found in the Kerameikus.
We will then mount the Acropolis, and wander leisurely
about its marvellous ruins. From it we can
look out upon the general shape and disposition of
Attica, and plan our shorter excursions.
</p>

<p>
As some of the suggestions in my first edition
have found favor at Athens, I venture to point out
here the great benefit which the Greek archæologists
would confer on all Europe if they would publish an
official guide to Athens, with some moderately complete
account of the immense riches of its museums.
Such a book, which might appear under the sanction
of M. Rousopoulos, or Professor Koumanoudis,
might be promoted either by the Greek Parliament
or the University of Athens. Were it even published
in modern Greek, its sale must be large and
certain; and, by appendices, or new editions, it
could be kept up to the level of the new discoveries.
The catalogues of Kekulé and of Heydemann are
already wholly inadequate, and unless one has the
privilege of knowing personally one of the gentlemen
above named, it is very difficult indeed to
obtain any proper notion of the history, or of the
original sites, of the various objects which excite
curiosity or admiration at every step. Such a book
as I suggest would be hailed by every Hellenist in
<pb n='54'/><anchor id='Pg054'/>Europe as an inestimable boon. But in a land
where the able men are perpetually engaged in making
or observing new discoveries, they will naturally
despise the task of cataloguing what they know.
Hence, I suggest that some promising young scholar
might undertake the book, and have his work revised
by his masters in the sober and practical
school of Athens.<note place="foot">Since this was written there have been published (in German)
two careful catalogues of the sculptures of Athens by V. Sybel and
by Milchhöfer (1881), and there is besides the excellent <hi rend='italic'>Handbook
for Greece</hi> by Dr. Lolling (Bædeker). The new edition of
Murray’s Handbook is very dear and not very satisfactory. There
is a small Greek Catalogue published by Stanford, translated by
Miss Agnes Smith. The Mycenæan antiquities are described in a
separate book by Schliemann, and by Schuchhardt.</note>

<head type="sub">ATHENS—THE MUSEUMS—THE TOMBS.</head>

<p>
Nothing is more melancholy and more disappointing
than the first view of the Athenian museums.
Almost every traveller sees them after passing
through Italy, where everything—indeed far too
much—has been done to make the relics of antiquity
perfect and complete. Missing noses, and arms, and
feet have been restored; probable or possible names
have been assigned to every statue; they are set up,
generally, in handsome galleries, with suitable decoration;
the visitor is provided with full descriptive
catalogues. Nothing of all this is found in Greece.
The fragments are merely sorted: many of the
mutilated statues are lying prostrate, and, of course,
in no way restored. Everything is, however, in process
of being arranged. But there is room to apprehend
that in fifty years things will still be found
changing their places, and still in process of being
arranged. It is not fair to complain of these things
in a nation which is fully occupied with its political
and commercial development, and where new classical
remains are constantly added to the museums.
Every nerve is being strained by the Greeks to obtain
<pb n='56'/><anchor id='Pg056'/>their proper rights in the possible break-up of the
Ottoman Empire. Great efforts are, besides, being
made to develop not only the ports, but the manufactures
of the country. The building of new roads
is more vital to the nation than the saving and ordering
of artistic remains. Thus we must trust to
private enterprise and generosity to settle these
things; and these have hitherto not been wanting
among the Greeks. But their resources are small,
and they require help both in money and in sympathy.
So, then, unless foreign influences be continuously
brought to bear,—all the foreign schools
act unselfishly at their own expense,—I fear that
all of us who visit Athens will be doomed to that
first feeling of disappointment.
</p>

<p>
But I am bound to add that every patient observer
who sets to work in spite of his disappointment, and
examines with honest care these <q>disjecta membra</q>
of Attic art—any one who will replace in imagination
the tips of noses—any one who will stoop over
lying statues, and guess at the context of broken
limbs—such an observer will find his vexation gradually
changing into wonder, and will at last come to
see that all the smoothly-restored Greek work in
Italian museums is not worth a tithe of the shattered
fragments in the real home and citadel of pure art.
This is especially true of the museum on the Acropolis.
It is, however, also true of the other
museums, and more obviously true of the reliefs
<pb n='57'/><anchor id='Pg057'/>upon the tombs. The assistance of an experienced
Athenian antiquary is also required, who knows his
way among the fragments, and who can tell the
history of the discovery, and the theories of the
purport of each. There are a good many men of
ability and learning connected with the University
of Athens, who describe each object in the antiquarian
papers as it is discovered. But when I
asked whether I could buy or subscribe to any
recognized organ for such information, I was told
(as I might have expected) that no single paper or
periodical was so recognized. Clashing interests and
personal friendships determine <hi rend='italic'>where</hi> each discovery
is to be announced; so that often the professedly
archæological journals contain no mention of such
things, while the common daily papers secure the
information.
</p>

<p>
Here, again, we feel the want of some stronger
government—some despotic assertion of a law of
gravitation to a common centre—to counteract the
strong centrifugal forces acting all through Greek
society. The old <hi rend='italic'>autonomy</hi> of the Greeks—that old
assertion of local independence which was at once
their greatness and their ruin—this strong instinct
has lasted undiminished to the present day. They
seem even now to hate pulling together, as we say.
They seem always ready to assert their individual
rights and claims against those of the community
or the public. The old Greeks had as a safeguard
<pb n='58'/><anchor id='Pg058'/>their divisions into little cities and territories; so
that their passion for autonomy was expended on
their city interests, in which the individual could
forget himself. But as the old Greeks were often
too selfish for this, and asserted their personal
autonomy against their own city, so the modern
Greek, who has not this safety-valve, finds it difficult
to rise to the height of acting in the interests of the
nation at large; and though he converses much and
brilliantly about Hellenic unity, he generally allows
smaller interests to outweigh this splendid general
conception. I will here add a most annoying example
of this particularist feeling, which obtrudes
itself upon every visitor to Athens. The most trying
thing in the streets is the want of shade, and the
consequent glare of the houses and roadway. Yet
along every street there are planted pepper-trees of
graceful growth and of delicious scent. But why
are they all so wretchedly small and bare? Because
each inhabitant chooses to hack away the growing
branches in front of his own door. The Prime
Minister, who deplored this curious Vandalism, said
he was powerless to check it. Until, however, the
Athenians learn to control themselves, and let their
trees grow, Athens will be an ugly and disagreeable
city.
</p>

<p>
So, then, the Greeks will not even agree to tell
us where we may find a complete list of newly-discovered
antiquities. Nor, indeed, does the Athenian
<pb n='59'/><anchor id='Pg059'/>public care very much, beyond a certain vague
pride, for such things, if we except one peculiar
kind, which has taken among them somewhat the
place of old china among us. There have been
found in many Greek cemeteries—in Megara, in Cyrene,
and of late in great abundance and excellence
at Tanagra, in Bœotia—little figures of terra cotta,
often delicately modelled and richly colored both in
dress and limbs. These figures are ordinarily from
eight to twelve inches high, and represent ladies
both sitting and standing in graceful attitudes, young
men in pastoral life, and other such subjects. I was
informed that some had been found in various places
through Greece, but the main source of them—and
a very rich source—is the Necropolis at Tanagra.
There are several collections of these figures on cup-boards
and in cabinets in private houses at Athens,
all remarkable for the marvellous modernness of
their appearance. The graceful drapery of the
ladies especially is very like modern dress, and
many have on their heads flat round hats, quite
similar in design to the gipsy hats much worn among
ladies of late years. But above all, the hair was
drawn back from the forehead, not at all in what is
considered Greek style, but rather<hi rend='italic'> à
    <anchor id="corr059"/><corr sic="l">l’</corr> Eugénie</hi>, as
we used to say when we were young. Many hold
in their hands large fans, like those which we make
of peacocks’ feathers. No conclusive theory has
yet been started, so far as I know, concerning the
<pb n='60'/><anchor id='Pg060'/>object or intention of these figures. So many of
them are female figures, that it seems unlikely they
were portraits of the deceased; and the frequent
occurrence of two figures together, especially one
woman being carried by another, seems almost to
dissuade us from such a theory. They seem to be
the figures called <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">Κόραι</foreign> by many old Greeks, which
were used as toys by children, and, perhaps, as
ornaments. The large class of tradesmen who made
them were called <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">Κορόπλαθοι</foreign>, and were held in contempt
by real sculptors. Most of them are, indeed,
badly modelled, and evidently the work of ignorant
tradesmen. If it could be shown that they were
only found in the graves of children, it would be a
touching sign of that world-wide feeling among the
human race, to bury with the dead friend whatever
he loved and enjoyed in his life on earth, that he
might not feel lonely in his cold and gloomy grave.<note place="foot">There is no more pathetic instance than that described by Mr.
Squier (in his admirable work on Peru) of the tomb of a young
girl which he himself discovered, and where he comments on the
various objects laid to rest with the dead: cf. Squier’s <hi rend='italic'>Peru</hi>, p. 80.
There has since been found at Myrina, on the Asiatic coast, a
great store of these clay figures, also in tombs. Some sets of them
were made to represent the sculptures of a pediment, such as that
of the Parthenon, or rather of the east front of the temple of
Olympia.</note>
But it seems unlikely that this limitation can ever
be proved.
</p>

<p>
There is an equal difficulty as to their age. The
<pb n='61'/><anchor id='Pg061'/>Greeks say that the tombs in which they are found
are not later than the second century <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>, and it is,
indeed, hard to conceive at what later period there
was enough wealth and art to produce such often
elegant, and often costly, results. Tanagra and
Thespiæ were, indeed, in Strabo’s day (lib. ix. 2) the
only remaining cities of Bœotia; the rest, he says,
were but ruins and names. But we may be certain
that in that time of universal decay the remaining
towns must have been as poor and insignificant as
they now are. Thus, we seem thrown back into
classical or Alexandrian days for the origin of these
figures, which in their bright coloring—pink and
blue dresses, often gilded fringes, the hair always
fair, so far as I could find—are, indeed, like what
we know of old Greek statuary, but in other respects
surprisingly modern.<note place="foot">If I mistake not, Mr. A. S. Murray seems disposed to date
them about the first century either <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi> or <hi rend='small'>A. D.</hi>, thus bringing
them down to about the time of Strabo.</note> If their antiquity can be
strictly demonstrated, it will but show another case
of the versatility of the Greeks in all things relating
to art: how, with the simplest material, and at a
long distance from the great art centres, they produced
a type of exceeding grace and refinement
totally foreign to their great old models, varying in
dress, attitude—in every point of style—from ordinary
Greek sculpture, and anticipating much of the
modern ideals of beauty and elegance.
</p>

<pb n='62'/><anchor id='Pg062'/>

<p>
But it is necessary to suspend our judgment, and
wait for further and closer investigation. The
workmen at Tanagra are now forbidden to sell these
objects to private fanciers; and in consequence,
their price has risen so enormously, that those in the
market, if of real elegance and artistic merit, cannot
be obtained for less than from £40 to £60. As
much as 2000 francs has been paid for one, when
they were less common. From this price downward
they can still be bought in Athens, the rude and
badly finished specimens being cheap enough. The
only other method of procuring them, or of procuring
them more cheaply, is to make diligent inquiries
when travelling in the interior, where they may
often be bought from poor people, either at Megara,
Tanagra, or elsewhere, who have chanced to find
them, and are willing enough to part with them after
a certain amount of bargaining.
</p>

<p>
It is convenient to dispose of this peculiar and
distinct kind of Greek antiquities, because they
seem foreign to the rest, and cannot be brought
under any other head. These figurines have now
found their way into most European museums.<note place="foot">There is already quite a large collection of them in the British
Museum, <hi rend='italic'>e. g.</hi> Vase Room I., case 35, where there are many
of these figures from Tanagra. In Room II. there is a whole case
of them, chiefly from Cyrene, and from Cnidus.</note>
</p>

<p>
I pass to the public collections at Athens, in
which we find few of these figures, and which
<pb n='63'/><anchor id='Pg063'/>rather contain the usual products of Greek plastic
art—statues, reliefs, as well as pottery, and inscriptions.
As I have said, the statues are in the most
lamentable condition, shattered into fragments, without
any attempt at restoring even such losses as can
be supplied with certainty. What mischief might
be done by such wholesale restoration as was practised
in Italy some fifty years ago, it is hard to say.
But perhaps the reaction against that error has
driven us to an opposite extreme.
</p>

<p>
There is, indeed, one—a naked athlete, with his
cloak hanging over the left shoulder, and coiled
round the left forearm—which seems almost as good
as any strong male figure which we now possess.
While it has almost exactly the same treatment of
the cloak on the left arm which we see in the celebrated
Hermes of the Vatican,<note place="foot">No. 53, Mus. Pio Clem., in a small room beside the <hi rend='italic'>Apollo Belvedere</hi>
and <hi rend='italic'>Laocoon</hi>.</note> the proportions of
the figure are nearer the celebrated <hi rend='italic'>Discobolus</hi> (numbered
126, Braccio Nuovo). There are two other
copies at Florence, and one at Naples. These repetitions
point to some very celebrated original, which
the critics consider to be of the older school of Polycletus,
and even imagine may possibly be a copy of
his <hi rend='italic'>Doryphorus</hi>, which was called the <hi rend='italic'>Canon</hi> statue,
or model of the perfect manly form. The Hermes
has too strong a likeness to Lysippus’s <hi rend='italic'>Apoxyomenos</hi>
not to be recognized as of the newer school. What
<pb n='64'/><anchor id='Pg064'/>we have, then, in this Attic statue seems an intermediate
type between the earlier and stronger school
of Polycletus and the more elegant and newer school
of Lysippus in Alexander’s day.
</p>

<p>
There can, however, be no doubt that it does not
date from the older and severer age of sculpture, of
which Phidias and Polycletus were the highest representatives.
Any one who studies Greek art perceives
how remarkably not only the style of dress
and ornament, but even the proportions of the figure
change, as we come down from generation to generation
in the long line of Greek sculptors. The
friezes of Selinus (now at Palermo), and those of
Ægina (now in Munich), which are among our earliest
classical specimens, are remarkable for short,
thick-set forms. The men are men five feet seven,
or, at most, eight inches high, and their figures are
squat even for that height. In the specimens we
have of the days of Phidias and Polycletus these
proportions are altered. The head of the <hi rend='italic'>Doryphorus</hi>,
if we can depend upon our supposed copies,
is still heavy, and the figure bulky, though taller
in proportion. He looks a man of five feet ten
inches at least. The statue we are just considering
is even taller, and is like the copies we have of
Lysippus’s work, the figure apparently of a man
of six feet high; but his head is not so small, nor
is he so slender and light as this type is usually
found.
</p>

<pb n='65'/><anchor id='Pg065'/>

<p>
It is not very easy to give a full account of this
change. There is, of course, one general reason
well known—the art of the Greeks, like almost all
such developments, went through stiffness and clumsiness
into dignity and strength, to which it presently
added that grace which raises strength into
majesty. But in time the seeking after grace becomes
too prominent, and so strength, and with it,
of course, the majesty which requires strength as
well as grace, is gradually lost. Thus we arrive
at a period when the forms are merely elegant or
voluptuous, without any assertion of power. I will
speak of a similar development among female figures
in connection with another subject which will
naturally suggest it.
</p>

<p>
This can only be made plain by a series of illustrations.
Of course, the difficulty of obtaining
really archaic statues was very great.<note place="foot">There is now an excellent publication of the archaic statues
found in the Acropolis, by Cavvadias (Wilberg, Athens).</note> They were
mostly sacred images of the gods, esteemed venerable
and interesting by the Greeks, but seldom
copied. Happily, the Romans, when they set
themselves to admire and procure Greek statues,
had fits of what we now call pre-Raphaelitism—fits
of admiration for the archaic and devout, even if
ungraceful, in preference to the more perfect forms
of later art. Hence, we find in Italy a number of
<pb n='66'/><anchor id='Pg066'/>statues which, if not really archaic, are at least
<hi rend='italic'>archaistic</hi>, as the critics call it—imitations or copies
of archaic statues. With these we need now no
longer be content. And we may pause a moment
on the question of archaic Greek art, because, apart
from the imitations of the time of Augustus and
Hadrian, we had already some really genuine fragments
in the little museum in the Acropolis—fragments
saved, not from the present Parthenon, but
rather from about the ruins of the older Parthenon.
This temple was destroyed by the Persians, and the
materials were built into the surrounding wall of
the Acropolis by the Athenians, when they began to
strengthen and beautify it at the opening of their
career of dominion and wealth. The stains of fire
are said to be still visible on these drums of pillars
now built into the fortification, and there can be no
doubt of their belonging to the old temple, as it is
well attested.<note place="foot">I endeavored to examine these drums by looking down through
a hole in the wall over them. They seemed to me not fluted, and
rather of the shape of barrels, very thick in the middle, than of
the drums of pillars in temples.</note> But I do not agree with the statement
that these older materials were so used in order
to nurse a perpetual hatred against the Persians in
the minds of the people, who saw daily before them
the evidence of the ancient wrong done to their
temples.<note place="foot">It is asserted somewhere by a Greek author that the temples
burned by the Persians were left in ruins to remind the people of
the wrongs of the hated barbarians. But we have distinct evidence,
in some cases, that this assertion is not true, and besides,
using the materials for other purposes is not the same thing. We
now know that a quantity of mutilated statues were shot as rubbish
into the space between the old Parthenon and the wall, to make a
terrace for the newer and greater building. Here they were found
in the recent excavations.</note> I believe this sentimental twaddle to be
<pb n='67'/><anchor id='Pg067'/>quite foreign to all Greek feeling. The materials
were used in the wall because they were unsuitable
for the newer temples, and because they must otherwise
be greatly in the way on the limited surface of
the Acropolis.
</p>

<p>
A fair specimen of the old sculptures first found
is a very stiff, and, to us, comical figure, which
has lost its legs, but is otherwise fairly preserved,
and which depicts a male figure with curious conventional
hair, and still more conventional beard,
holding by its four legs a bull or calf, which he is
carrying on his shoulders. The eyes are now hollow,
and were evidently once filled with something different
from the marble of which the statue is made.
The whole pose and style of the work is stiff and
expressionless, and it is one of the most characteristic
remains of the older Attic art still in existence.
</p>

<p>
Happily there is little doubt what the statue means.
It is the votive offering of the Marathonians, which
Pausanias saw in the Acropolis, and which commemorated
the legend of Theseus having driven the wild
<pb n='68'/><anchor id='Pg068'/>bull, sent against them by Minos, from Marathon to
the Acropolis, where he sacrificed it. Pausanias
does not say how Theseus was represented with the
bull; but it certainly was not a group—such a thing
is clearly beyond the narrow and timid conceptions
of the artists of that day. It being difficult to represent
this hero and bull together except by representing
the man carrying the bull, the artist has
made the animal full grown in type, but as small as
a calf, and has, of course, not attempted any expression
of hostility between the two. The peaceful
look, which merely arises from the inability of the
artist to render expression, has led many good art
critics to call it not a Theseus but a Hermes. Such
being the obscure history of the statue, it is not
difficult to note its characteristics. We see the conventional
treatment of the hair, the curious transparent
garments lying close to the skin, and the very
heavy muscular forms of the arms and body. The
whole figure is stiff and expressionless, and strictly
in what is called the hieratic or old religious style,
as opposed to an ideal or artistic conception.
</p>

<p>
There are two full-length reliefs—one which I
first saw in a little church near Orchomenus, and a
couple more at Athens in the Theseon—which are
plainly of the same epoch and style of art. The
most complete Athenian one is ascribed as the
stele of Aristion, and as the work of Aristocles,<note place="foot">Aristion is also mentioned among the artists of the period.</note>
<pb n='69'/><anchor id='Pg069'/>doubtless an artist known as contemporary with those
who fought at the battle of Marathon. Thus we
obtain a very good clue to the date at which this
art flourished. There is also the head of a similar
figure, with the hair long and fastened in a knot
behind, and with a discus raised above the shoulder,
so as to look like a nimbus round the head, which is
one of the most interesting objects in the Varvakion.
But of the rest the pedestal only is preserved. Any
impartial observer will see in these figures strong
traces of the influence of Asiatic style. This influence
seems about as certain, and almost as much
disputed, as the Egyptian influences on the Doric
style of architecture. To an unbiassed observer
these influences speak so plainly, that, in the absence
of strict demonstration to the contrary, one feels
bound to admit them—the more so, as we know that
the Greeks, like all other people of genius, were
ever ready and anxious to borrow from others. It
should be often repeated, because it is usually ignored,
that it is a most original gift to know how to borrow;
and that those only who feel wanting in originality
are anxious to assert it. Thus the Romans, who
borrowed without assimilating, are always asserting
their originality; the Greeks, who borrowed more
and better, because they made what they borrowed
their own, never care to do so. The hackneyed
parallel of Shakespeare will occur to all.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the museums of Athens show us
<pb n='70'/><anchor id='Pg070'/>but few examples of the transition state of art
between this and the perfect work of Phidias’s
school. The Æginetan marbles are less developed
than Phidias’s work; but from the relief of Aristion,
and the Theseus of the Acropolis, to these, is a wide
gulf in artistic feeling. The former is the work of
children shackled by their material, still more by
conventional rules; the latter the work of men.
There is also the well-known Apollo of Thera;
a similar Apollo found at Athens, with very conventional
curls, and now in the National Museum; and
two or three small sitting statues of Athene which,
though very archaic, begin to approach the grace of
artistic sculpture. But Italy is sufficiently rich in
imitations of this very period. There are four very
remarkable statues in a small room of the Villa
Albani, near Rome, which are not photographed,
because the public would, doubtless, think them
bad art, but which, could I procure copies and
reproduce them, would illustrate clearly what I
desire. We have also among the bronzes found
at Pompeii statues precisely of this style, evidently
copies from old Greek originals, and made to satisfy
the pre-Raphaelitism (as I have already called it)
of Italian amateurs. I select a bronze Artemis as
an interesting example of this antiquarian taste in
a later age. The statuette maintains in the face
the very features which we think so comical when
looking at the relief of Aristion, or the women
<pb n='71'/><anchor id='Pg071'/>of the Acropolis. They are, no doubt, softened and
less exaggerated, but still they are there. The so-called
Greek profile is not yet attained. The general
features of the old Greek face in monuments
were a retreating forehead, a peaked nose, slightly
turned up at the end, the mouth drawn in, and the
corners turned up, flat elongated eyes (especially
full in the profiles of reliefs), a prominent angular
chin, lank cheeks, and high ears. These lovely
features can be found on hundreds of vases, because,
vase-making being rather a trade than an art, men
kept close to the old models long after great sculptors
and painters had, like Polygnotus, begun to
depart from the antique stiffness of the countenance.<note place="foot"><q>Vultum ab antiquo rigore variare.</q>—Plin. xxxv. 35.</note>
The Artemis in question has, however, these very
features, which are very clear when we can see her
in profile. But the head-dress and draping are
elaborate, and though formal and somewhat rigid,
not wanting in grace. The pose of the arms is
stiff, and the attitude that of a woman stepping
forward, which is very usual in archaic figures—I
suppose because it enlarged the base of the statue,
and made it stand more firmly in its place. The
absence of any girdle or delaying fold in the
garments is one of the most marked contrasts with
the later draping of such figures.
</p>

<p>
But now at last we can show the reader how far
the antiquarians of later days were able to imitate
<pb n='72'/><anchor id='Pg072'/>archaic sculpture. Another characteristic archaic
statue was one of the seventeen found in 1885–86 on
the Acropolis,<note place="foot">They have been published in the first part of an excellent work
on the treasures of Athens, reproduced in phototype by Rhomaïdès
Brothers, with an explanatory text by various Athenian scholars.</note> where they had been piled together
with portions of pillars and other stones to extend the
platform for new buildings. The style and the mutilation
of all these statues, which, from their uniform
type, are more probably votive offerings than sacred
images, point to their being the actual statues which
the Persians overthrew when ravaging the Acropolis
(480 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>). They were so broken and spoiled that
the Athenians, when restoring and rebuilding their
temples, determined to use them for rubbish. Thus
we have now a perfectly authentic group of works
showing us the art of the older Athens before the Persian
Wars. They are each made of several pieces
of marble, apparently Parian, dowelled together like
wooden work, and the figure here reproduced has a
bronze pin protruding from the head, apparently to
hold a nimbus or covering of metal. They were all
richly colored, as many traces upon them still show.<note place="foot">I cannot do better than quote the admirable description of M.
Ch. Diehl: <q>C’étaient surtout de nouvelles statues de jeunes femmes,
au mystérieux sourire, à la parure étincelante, de ces idoles fardées
et peintes, bien faites, par leur saveur étrange, pour tenter le pinceau
d’un Gustave Moreau ou la plume d’un Pierre Loti. Comme leurs
sœurs, ces nouvelles venues ont la même attitude et le même
costume, les mêmes coquetteries de parure, le même soin de leur
chevelure, la même expression aussi; pourtant à la série déjà
connue elles out ajouté quelques œuvres exquises, et trois d’entre
elles en particulier méritent d’être signalées. L’une est une
merveille de coloris; sa tunique à large bande rouge, sa chemisette
d’un vert foncé, bordée de pourpre, son manteau orné de méandres
du dessin le plus fin, ses vêtements parsemés de croix rouges ou
vertes, qui se retrouvent sur le diadème de ses cheveux, sont d’un
incomparable éclat. Sous les tons chauds de ces riches couleurs
disposées avec un goût exquis, il semble que le marbre s’anime et
fasse la chair vivante; et un charme étrange émane de cette figure.
Celle-ci (cf. Plate) d’une date plus récente, probablement l’une des
plus jeunes de la série, montre l’effort d’un artiste habile pour créer
une œuvre originale. Dans ces formes élancées, dans cette tête
petite et fine, dans ces bras jetés en avant du corps, on sent la
volonté du maître qui cherche à faire autrement que ses devanciers;
le sourire traditionnel est devenu presque imperceptible, les yeux,
qui souriaient jadis à l’unison des levres, out cessé de se relever
vers les tempes; les joues creuses se remplissent et s’arrondissent;
avec des œuvres de cette sorte, l’archaisme est prêt à finir.... La
troisième enfin est une des œuvres les plus remarquables de l’art
attique. Plus ancienne que la précédente, elle est d’une valeur
artistique bien supérieure. Le modelé en est exquis, et son irréprochable
finesse fait un contraste singulier avec les procédés qui
sentent encore les conventions de l’école. Suivant les traditions de
l’art antique, les yeux sont obliques et bridés, le sourire fait toujours
grimacer les levres; mais dans les yeux le regard n’est plus indifférent
et fixe; il brille d’une lueur de vie et de pensée; le sourire
de ces levres n’est plus sec et dur, il semble avoir une douceur
attendrie. Certes il n’y a dans cette sculpture nul effort pour
chercher des chemins nouveaux; mais parmi les œuvres de l’art
archaïque, parmi celles où le maître a docilement suivi la route
frayée et battue, cette sculpture à l’expression candide et presque
attristée est l’une des plus admirables.</q>—<hi rend='italic'>Excursions archéologiques

<pb n='73'/><anchor id='Pg073'/>

<p>
Let us now leave this archaic art and go to the
street of tombs, where we can find such specimens
as the world can hardly equal, and in such condition
<pb n='74'/><anchor id='Pg074'/>as to be easily intelligible. A good many of these
tombs, and some of them very fine, have lately been
removed to the National Museum, where they are no
doubt safer, and more easily studied and compared,
though there is something lost in not having them
upon their original site, with some at least of their
original surroundings. What I have said of the
museums is, even so, disappointing, as indeed it
should be, if the feelings of the visitor are to be
faithfully reproduced. But I must not fail to add,
before turning to other places, that in inscriptions
these museums are very rich, as well as also in Attic
vases, and lamps, and other articles of great importance
in our estimate of old Greek life. The
professors of the University have been particularly
diligent in deciphering and explaining the inscriptions,
and with the aid of the Germans, who have
collected, and are still collecting, these scattered
documents in a complete publication, we are daily
having new light thrown upon Greek history. Thus
<sic>Kohler</sic> has been able from the recovered Attic
tribute-lists to construct a map of the Athenian
maritime empire with its dependencies, which tells
the student more in five minutes than hours of laborious
reading. The study of vases and lamps is
beyond my present scope; and the former so wide
and complicated a subject, that it cannot be mastered
without long study and trouble.<note place="foot">When I revisited Athens in the spring of 1889, the National
Museum, which is a fine and spacious building, was quite an
orderly museum, and it was easy to see and enjoy the works of art
preserved in it. The archaic things were, moreover (as in the
Acropolis), placed by themselves; so were the tombs, and so were
most of the portrait busts. All that was still wanting was a good
and complete catalogue.</note>
</p>

<pb n='75'/><anchor id='Pg075'/>

<p>
I pass, therefore, from the museums to the street
of tombs, which Thucydides tells us to find in the
fairest suburb of the city, as we go out westward
towards the groves of Academe, and before we
turn slightly to the south on our way to the Peiræus.
Thucydides has described with some care
the funeral ceremonies held in this famous place,
and has composed for us a very noble funeral oration,
which he has put in the mouth of Pericles.<note place="foot">These
    panegyrics—<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">λόγοι ἐπιτάφιοι</foreign> they were called—were a
favorite exercise of Greek literary men. There are five classical
ones still extant—that mentioned, that in the <hi rend='italic'>Menexenus</hi> of Plato,
that of Hypereides, and those ascribed (justly) to Lysias and
(falsely) to Demosthenes. That of Hypereides, very mutilated as
it is, seems to me the finest next to that of Thucydides. But they
are all built upon the same lines, showing even here that strict
conservatism in every branch of Greek art which never varied,
for variety’s sake, from a type once recognized as really good.</note>
It is with this oration, probably the finest passage
in Thucydides’s great history, in our minds, that
we approach the avenue where the Athenians laid
their dead. We have to pass through the poorest
portion of modern Athens, through wretched
<hi rend='italic'>bazaars</hi> and dirty markets, which abut upon the
main street. Amid all this squalor and poverty, all
this complete denial of art and leisure, there are
<pb n='76'/><anchor id='Pg076'/>still features which faintly echo old Greek life.
There is the bright color of the dresses—the predominance
of white, and red, and blue, of which
the old Athenians were so fond; and there is among
the lowest classes a great deal of that striking beauty
which recalls to us the old statues. More especially
in the form of the head, and in the expression, of
the children, we see types not to be found elsewhere
in Europe, and which, if not derived from classical
Greece, are at all events very beautiful.
</p>

<p>
We then come on to the railway station, which is,
indeed, in this place, as elsewhere, very offensive.
With its grimy smoke, its shrill sounds, and all its
other hard unloveliness, it is not a meet neighbor
for the tombs of the old Greeks, which are close to
it on all sides.
</p>

<p>
They lie—as almost all old ruins do—far below
the present level of the ground, and have, therefore,
to be exhumed by careful digging. When this has
been done they are covered with a rude door, to
protect their sculptured face; and when I first saw
them were standing about, without any order or regularity,
close to the spots where they had been found.
</p>

<p>
A proper estimate of these tombs cannot be attained
without appreciating the feelings with which
the survivors set them up. And we must consider
not only the general attitude of Greek literature on
the all-important question of the state of man after
death, but also the thousands of inscriptions upon
<pb n='77'/><anchor id='Pg077'/>tombs, both with and without sculptured reliefs, if
we will form a sure opinion about the feelings of
the bereaved in these bygone days.
</p>

<p>
We know from Homer and from Mimnermus that
in the earlier periods, though the Greeks were unable
to shake off a belief in life after death, they could not
conceive that state as anything but a shadowy and
wretched echo of the real life upon earth. It was
a gloomy existence, burdened with the memory of
lost happiness and the longing for lost enjoyment.
To the Homeric Greeks death was a dark unavoidable
fate, without hope and without reward. It is,
indeed, true that we find in Pindar thoughts and aspirations
of a very different kind. We have in the
fragments of his poetry more than one passage asserting
the rewards of the just, and the splendors of
a future life far happier than that which we now
enjoy. But, notwithstanding these noble visions,
such high expectation laid no hold upon the imagination
of the Greek world. The poems of
Pindar, we are told, soon ceased to be popular, and
his visions are but a streak of light amid general
gloom. The kingdom of the dead in Æschylus is
evidently, as in Homer, but a weary echo of this
life, where honor can only be attained by the pious
service of loving kinsfolk, whose duty paid to the
dead affects him in his gloomier state, and raises
him in the esteem of his less-remembered fellows.
Sophocles says nothing to clear away the night; nay
<pb n='78'/><anchor id='Pg078'/>rather his deepest and maturest contemplation regards
death as the worst of ills to the happy man—a
sorry refuge to the miserable. Euripides longs
that there may be no future state; and Plato only
secures the immortality of the soul by severing it
from the person—the man, and all his interests.
</p>

<p>
It is plain, from this evidence, that the Greeks
must have looked upon the death of those they
loved with unmixed sorrow. It was the final parting,
when all the good and pleasant things are remembered;
when men seek, as it were, to increase
the pang, by clothing the dead in all his sweetest
and dearest presence. But this was not done by
pompous inscriptions, or by a vain enumeration of
all the deceased had performed—inscriptions which,
among us, tell more of the vanity than of the grief
of the survivors. The commonest epitaph was a
simple <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">χαῖρε</foreign>, or farewell; and it is this single word,
so full and deep in its meaning to those who love,
which is pictured in the tomb reliefs. They are
simple parting scenes, expressing the grief of the
survivors, and the great sadness of the sufferer, who
is going to his long home.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, what strikes us forcibly in these remarkable
monuments is the chastened modest expression
of sorrow which they display. There is no
violence, no despair, no extravagance—all is simple
and noble; thus combining purity of art with a far
deeper pathos—a far nobler grief—than that of the
<pb n='79'/><anchor id='Pg079'/>exaggerated paintings and sculptures which seek to
express mourning in later and less cultivated ages.<note place="foot">Roubillac’s monuments in Westminster Abbey, which excited
the admiration of his contemporaries, are the best example I
know of degradation in public taste on this question.</note>
We may defy any art to produce truer or more
poignant pictures of real sorrow—a sorrow, as I
have explained, far deeper and more hopeless than
any Christian sorrow; and yet there is no wringing
of hands, no swooning, no defacing with sackcloth
and ashes.<note place="foot">I did, indeed, see one relief at Athens, in which the relatives
are represented as rushing forward in agony, as it were to delay
the departure of the fainting figure. It is right that this exception
should be noted, as it shows that they understood what
violent grief was, and yet avoided representing it as a rule.</note> Sometimes, indeed, as in the celebrated
tomb of Dexileos, a mere portrait of the dead in
active life was put upon his tomb, and private grief
would not assert itself in presence of the record of
his public services.

<p>
I know not that any other remnants of Greek art
bring home to us more plainly one of its eternal and divine
features—or shall I rather say, one of its eternal
and human features?—the greatest, if not the main
feature, which has made it the ever new and ever
lasting lawgiver to men in their efforts to represent
the ideal.
</p>

<p>
If I am to permit myself any digression whatever,
we cannot do better than conclude this chapter with
some reflections on this subject, and we may
there<pb n='80'/><anchor id='Pg080'/>fore turn, by suggestion of the Athenian tombs, to a
few general remarks on the <hi rend='italic'>reserve</hi> of Greek art—I
mean the reserve in the displaying emotion, in the
portraying of the fierce outbursts of joy or grief;
and again, more generally, the reserve in the exhibiting
of peculiar or personal features, passing interests,
or momentary emotions.
</p>

<p>
In a philosophy now rather forgotten than extinct,
and which once commanded no small attention,
Adam Smith was led to analyze the indirect effects
of <hi rend='italic'>sympathy</hi>, from which, as a single principle, he
desired to deduce all the rules of ethics. While
straining many points unduly, he must be confessed
to have explained with great justice the
origin of good taste or tact in ordinary life, which
he saw to be the careful watching of the interest of
others in our own affairs, and the feeling that we
must not force upon them what concerns ourselves,
except we are sure to carry with us their active
sympathy. Good breeding, he says, consists in a
delicate perception how far this will go, and in suppressing
those of our feelings which, though they
affect <hi rend='italic'>us</hi> strongly, cannot be expected to affect in
like manner our neighbor, whose sympathy should be
the measure and limit of our outspokenness. There
can be no doubt that whatever other elements come
in, this analysis is true, so far as it goes, and recommends
itself at once to the convictions of any educated
man. The very same principle applies still more
<pb n='81'/><anchor id='Pg081'/>strongly and universally in art. As tragedy is bound
to treat ideal griefs and joys of so large and broad a
kind that every spectator may merge in them his
petty troubles, so ideal sculpture and painting are
only ideal so far as they represent those large and
eternal features in human nature which must always
command the sympathy of every pure human heart.
</p>

<p>
Let us dispose at once of an apparent exception—the
mediæval pictures of the Passion of Christ,
and the sorrows of the Virgin Mary. Here the
artist allowed himself the most extreme treatment,
because the objects were necessarily the centre of
the very highest sympathy. No expression of the
grief of Christ could be thought exaggerated in the
Middle Ages, because in this very exaggeration lay
the centre point of men’s religion. But when no
such object of universal and all-absorbing sympathy
can be found (and there was none such in pagan
life), then the Greek artist must attain by his treatment
of the object what the Christian artist obtained
by the object itself. Assuming, then, a mastery
over his material, and sufficient power of execution,
the next feature to be looked for in Greek art, and
especially in Greek sculpture, is a certain modesty
and reserve in expression, which will not portray
slight defects in picturing a man, but represent that
eternal or ideal character in him which remains in
our memory when he is gone. Such, for example,
is the famous portrait-statue of Sophocles.
</p>

<pb n='82'/><anchor id='Pg082'/>

<p>
Such are also all that great series of ideal figures
which meet us in the galleries of ancient art. They
seldom show us any violent emotion; they are seldom
even in so special an attitude that critics cannot
interpret it in several different ways, or as suitable
to several myths. It is not passing states of feeling,
but the eternal and ideal beauty of human nature,
which Greek sculpture seeks to represent; and for
this reason it has held its sway through all the centuries
which have since gone by. This was the
calm art of Phidias, and Polycletus, and Polygnotus,
in sentiment not differing from the rigid awkwardness
of their predecessors, but in mastery of proportions
and of difficulties attaining the grace in which
the others had failed. To this general law there
are, no doubt, exceptions, and perhaps very brilliant
ones; yet they are exceptions, and even in them,
if we consider them attentively, we can see the universal
features and the points of sympathy for all
mankind. But if the appeal for sympathy is indeed
overstrained, then, however successful in its own
society and its own social atmosphere, the work of
art loses power when offered to another generation.
Thus Euripides, though justly considered in his own
society the most tragic of poets, has for this very
reason ceased to appeal to us as Æschylus still appeals.
For Æschylus kept within the proper bounds
dictated by the reserve of art; Euripides often did
<pb n='83'/><anchor id='Pg083'/>not, and his work, though great and full of genius,
suffered accordingly.
</p>

<p>
It seems to me that the tombs before us are remarkable
as exemplifying, with the tact of genius,
this true and perfect reserve. They are simple pictures
of the grief of parting—of the recollection of
pleasant days of love and friendship—of the gloom of
the unknown future. But there is no exaggeration,
nor speciality—no individuality, I had almost said—in
the picture. I feel no curiosity to inquire who
these people are—what were their names—even
what was the relationship of the deceased.<note place="foot">I fancy, from the unity of type shown in many of them, that
they may even have been designed by the artist without regard to
the special case, and purchased by the family of the deceased
ready made. The figures upon them do not seem to me personal
likenesses.</note> For I
am perfectly satisfied with an ideal portrait of the
grief of parting—a grief that comes to us all, and
lays bitter hold of us at some season of life; and it
is this universal sorrow—this great common flaw in
our lives—which the Greek artist has brought before
us, and which calls forth our deepest sympathy.
There will be future occasion to come back upon
this all-important feature in connection with the
<hi rend='italic'>action</hi> in Greek sculpture, and even with the draping
of their statues—in all of which the calm and
chaste reserve of the better Greek art contrasts
strangely with the Michael Angelos, and Berninis,
<pb n='84'/><anchor id='Pg084'/>and Canovas, of other days; nay, even with the
Greek sculpture of a no less brilliant but less refined
age.
</p>

<p>
But, in concluding this digression, I will call attention
to a modern parallel in the portraiture of
grief, and of grief at final parting. This parallel is
not a piece of sculpture, but a poem, perhaps the
most remarkable poem of our generation—the <hi rend='italic'>In
Memoriam</hi> of Lord Tennyson. Though written
from personal feeling, and to commemorate a special
person—Arthur Hallam—whom some of us even
knew, has this poem laid hold of the imagination of
men strongly and lastingly owing to the poet’s
special loss? Certainly not. I do not even think
that this great dirge—this magnificent funeral poem—has
excited in most of us any strong interest in
Arthur Hallam. In fact, any other friend of the
poet’s would have suited the general reader equally
well as the exciting cause of a poem, which we delight
in because it puts into great words the ever-recurring
and permanent features in such grief—those
dark longings about the future; those suggestions
of despair, of discontent with the providence
of the world, of wild speculation about its laws;
those struggles to reconcile our own loss, and that of
the human race, with some larger law of wisdom
and of benevolence. To the poet, of course, his
own particular friend was the great centre point of
the whole. But to us, in reading it, there is a wide
<pb n='85'/><anchor id='Pg085'/>distinction between the personal passages—I mean
those which give family details, and special circumstances
in Hallam’s life, or his intimacy with the
poet—and the purely poetical or artistic passages,
which soar away into a region far above all special
detail, and sing of the great gloom which hangs
over the future, and of the vehement beating of the
human soul against the bars of its prison house,
when one is taken, and another left, not merely at
apparent random, but with apparent injustice and
damage to mankind. Hence, every man in grief
for a lost friend will read the poem to his great comfort,
and will then only see clearly what it means;
and he will find it speak to him specially and particularly,
not in its personal passages, but in its general
features; in its hard metaphysics; in its mystical
theology; in its angry and uncertain ethics.
For even the commonest mind is forced by grief out
of its commonness, and attacks the world-problems,
which at other times it has no power or taste to approach.
</p>

<p>
By this illustration, then, the distinction between
the universal and the personal features of grief can
be clearly seen; and the reader will admit that,
though it would be most unreasonable to dictate to
the poet, or to imagine that he should have omitted
the stanzas which refer specially to his friend, and
which were to him of vital importance, yet to us it
is no loss to forget that name and those
circum<pb n='86'/><anchor id='Pg086'/>stances, and hold fast to the really eternal (and because
eternal, really artistic) features, in that very
noble symphony—shall I say of half-resolved discords,
or of suspended harmonies, which faith may
reconcile, but which reason can hardly analyze or
understand?<note place="foot">In the <hi rend='italic'>Adonais</hi>, Shelley affords a curious contrast to the somewhat
morbid prominence of the poet in the case before us. The
self-effacement of Shelley has centred all our interest on his lost
friend.</note>
</p>

<p>
Within a few minutes’ walk of these splendid
records of the dead, the traveller who returns to the
town across the Observatory Hill will find a very
different cemetery. For here he suddenly comes up
to a long cleft in the rock, running parallel with the
road below, and therefore quite invisible from it.
The rising ground towards the city hides it equally
from the Acropolis, and accordingly from all Athens.
This gorge, some two hundred yards long, sixty
wide, and over thirty feet deep, is the notorious
<hi rend='italic'>Barathrum</hi>, the place of execution in old days; the
place where criminals were cast out, and where the
public executioner resided. It has been falsely inferred
by the old scholiasts that the Athenians cast
men alive into the pit. It is not nearly deep
enough now to cause death in this way, and there
seems no reason why its original depth should have
been diminished by any accumulation of rubbish,
such as is common on inhabited sites. <q>Casting
<pb n='87'/><anchor id='Pg087'/>into the Barathrum</q> referred rather to the refusing
the rights of burial to executed criminals—an additional
disgrace, and to the Greeks a grave additional
penalty. Honor among the dead was held to
follow in exact proportion to the continued honors
paid by surviving friends.
</p>

<p>
Here, then, out of view of all the temples and
hallowed sites of the city, dwelt the public slave,
with his instruments of death, perhaps in a cave or
grotto, still to be seen in the higher wall of the
gorge, and situated close to the point where an old
path leads over the hill towards the city. Plato
speaks of young men turning aside, as they came
from Peiræus, to see the dead lying in charge of
this official; and there must have been times in the
older history of Athens when this cleft in the rock
was a place of carnage and of horror. The gentler
law of later days seems to have felt this outrage on
human feeling, and instead of casting the dead into
the Barathrum, it was merely added to the sentence
that the body should not be buried within the
boundaries of Attica. Yet, though the <hi rend='italic'>Barathrum</hi>
may have been no longer used, the accursed gate
(<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἱερὰ πύλη</foreign>) still led to it from the city, and the old
associations clung about its gloomy seclusion. Even
in the last century, the Turks, whether acting from
instinct, or led by old tradition, still used it as a
place of execution.
</p>

<p>
In the present day, all traces of this hideous
his<pb n='88'/><anchor id='Pg088'/>tory have long passed away, and I found a little field
of corn waving upon the level ground beneath,
which had once been the <hi rend='italic'>Aceldama</hi> of Athens.
But even now there seemed a certain loneliness and
weirdness about the place—silent and deserted in
the midst of thoroughfares, hidden from the haunts
of men, and hiding them from view by its massive
walls. Nay, as if to bring back the dark memories
of the past, great scarlet poppies stained the ground
in patches as it were with slaughter, and hawks and
ravens were still circling about overhead, as their
ancestors did in the days of blood; attached, I suppose,
by hereditary instinct to this fatal place, <q>for
where the carcase is, there shall the eagles be
gathered together.</q>

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>

<head type="sub">THE ACROPOLIS OF ATHENS.</head>

<p>
I suppose there can be no doubt whatever that
the ruins on the Acropolis of Athens are the most
remarkable in the world. There are ruins far
larger, such as the pyramids, and the remains of
Karnak. There are ruins far more perfectly preserved,
such as the great Temple at Pæstum.
There are ruins more picturesque, such as the ivy-clad
walls of mediæval abbeys beside the rivers in
the rich valleys of England. But there is no ruin,
all the world over, which combines so much striking
beauty, so distinct a type, so vast a volume of history,
so great a pageant of immortal memories.
There is, in fact, no building on earth which can
sustain the burden of such greatness, and so the first
visit to the Acropolis is and must be disappointing.
When the traveller reflects how all the Old World’s
culture culminated in Greece—all Greece in Athens—all
Athens in its Acropolis—all the Acropolis in
the Parthenon—so much crowds upon the mind confusedly
that we look for some enduring monument
whereupon we can fasten our thoughts, and from
which we can pass as from a visible starting-point
<pb n='90'/><anchor id='Pg090'/>into all this history and all this greatness. And at
first we look in vain. The shattered pillars and the
torn pediments will not bear so great a strain: and
the traveller feels forced to admit a sense of disappointment,
sore against his will. He has come a
long journey into the remoter parts of Europe; he
has reached at last what his soul had longed for
many years in vain: and as is wont to be the case
with all great human longings, the truth does not
fulfil his desire. The pang of disappointment is
all the greater when he sees that the tooth of time
and the shock of earthquake have done but little
harm. It is the hand of man—of reckless foe and
ruthless lover—which has robbed him of his hope.
This is the feeling, I am sure, of more than have
confessed it, when they first wound their way
through the fields of great blue aloes, and passed up
through the Propylæa into the presence of the Parthenon.
But to those who have not given way to
these feelings—who have gone again and again and
sat upon the rock, and watched the ruins at every
hour of the day, and in the brightness of a moonlight
night—to those who have dwelt among them,
and meditated upon them with love and awe—there
first come back the remembered glories of Athens’s
greatness, when Olympian Pericles stood upon this
rock with careworn Phidias, and reckless Alcibiades
with Pious Nicias and fervent Demosthenes with
caustic Phocion—when such men peopled the temples
<pb n='91'/><anchor id='Pg091'/>in their worship, and all the fluted pillars and sculptured
friezes were bright with scarlet, and blue, and
gold. And then the glory of remembered history
casts its hue over the war-stained remnants. Every
touch of human hand, every fluting, and drop, and
triglyph, and cornice recalls the master minds which
produced this splendor; and so at last we tear ourselves
from it as from a thing of beauty, which even
now we can never know, and love, and meditate
upon to our hearts’ content.
</p>

<p>
Nothing is more vexatious than the reflection,
how lately these splendid remains have been reduced
to their present state. The Parthenon, being
used as a Greek church, remained untouched and
perfect all through the Middle Ages. Then it became
a mosque, and the Erechtheum a seraglio, and
in this way survived with little damage till 1687,
when, in the bombardment by the Venetians under
Morosini, a shell dropped into the Parthenon, where
the Turks had their powder stored, and blew out the
whole centre of the building. Eight or nine pillars
at each side have been thrown down, and have left a
large gap, which so severs the front and rear of the
temple, that from the city below they look like the
remains of two different buildings. The great drums
of these pillars are yet lying there, in their order,
just as they fell, and some money and care might
set them all up again in their places; yet there is
not in Greece the patriotism or even the common
<pb n='92'/><anchor id='Pg092'/>sense to enrich the country by this restoration,
matchless in its certainty as well as in its splendor.
</p>

<p>
But the Venetians were not content with their exploit.
They were, about this time, when they held
possession of most of Greece, emulating the Pisan
taste for Greek sculptures; and the four fine lions
standing at the gate of the arsenal at Venice still
testify to their zeal in carrying home Greek trophies
to adorn their capital. Morosini wished to take
down the sculptures of Phidias from the eastern
pediment, but his workmen attempted it so clumsily
that the figures fell from their place, and were dashed
to pieces on the ground. The Italians also left their
lasting mark on the place by building a high square
tower of wretched patched masonry at the right
side of the entrance gate, which had of late years
become such an eyesore to the better educated public,
that when I was first at Athens there was a subscription
on foot to have it taken down—not only in
order to remove an obtrusive reminiscence of the
invaders, but in the hope of bringing to light some
pillars of the Propylæa built into it, as well as
many inscribed stones, broken off and carried away
from their places as building material. This expectation
has not been verified by the results. The
tower was taken down by the liberality of M.
Schliemann, and there were hardly any inscriptions
or sculptures discovered.
</p>

<p>
A writer in the <hi rend='italic'>Saturday Review</hi> (No. 1134)
<pb n='93'/><anchor id='Pg093'/>attacks this removal of the Venetian tower, and
my approval of it, as a piece of ignorant and barbarous
pedantry, which from love of the old Greek
work, and its sanctity, desires to destroy the later
history of the place, and efface the monuments of
its fortunes in after ages.<note place="foot">He also supposed that the tower was Frankish, and built long
before the Venetian conquest. But here he was wrong. The stones
inside the tower, when taken down, showed clear traces of gun-powder,
as was clearly shown in a learned refutation of his views,
printed at Athens.</note> This writer, whose personality
is unmistakable, thinks that even the Turkish
additions to the Parthenon should have been left
untouched, so that the student of to-day could
meditate upon all these incongruities, and draw
from them historical lessons. And, assuredly, of all
lessons conveyed, that of a victory over the Turks
would be to this writer the most important and the
most delightful.
</p>

<p>
If this great man will not silence us with his
authority, but let us argue with him, we might suggest
that there are, no doubt, cases where the interests
of art and of history are conflicting, and where
a restoration of pristine beauty must take away
from the evidences of later history. The real question
is then, whether the gain in art is greater than
the loss in history. In the case of the Parthenon
I think it is, now especially, when records and
drawings of the inferior additions can be secured.
<pb n='94'/><anchor id='Pg094'/>It may be historically important to note the special
work and character of every generation of men;
but surely for the education of the human race in
the laws of beauty, and in general culture, some
ages are worth nothing, and others worth everything;
and I will not admit that this sort of education
is one whit less important than education in the
facts of history.
</p>

<p>
Of course, artistic restorations are often carried
too far; a certain age may be arbitrarily assumed
as the canon of perfection, and everything else destroyed
to make way for it. There are few ages
which can lay claim to such pre-eminence as the
age of Pericles; yet even in this case, were the
mediæval additions really beautiful, we should, of
course, hesitate to disturb them. But the Venetian
tower, though a picturesque addition to the rock
when seen from a distance, so much so, that I felt
its loss when I saw the Acropolis again, had no
claim to architectural beauty; it was set up in a
place sacred to greater associations, and besides
there was every reasonable prospect that its removal
would subserve historical ends of far more importance
than the Venetian occupation of the Acropolis.
A few inscriptions of the date of Pericles, containing
treaties or other such public matter, would, in
my opinion, have perfectly justified its removal,
even though it did signify a victory of Christians
over Turks.
</p>

<pb n='95'/><anchor id='Pg095'/>

<p>
In any case, it seems to me unfair that if every
generation is to express its knowledge by material
results, we should not be permitted to record our conviction
that old Greek art or old Greek history is far
greater and nobler than either Turkish or Venetian
history, and to testify this opinion by making their
monuments give way to it. This is the mark of <hi rend='italic'>our</hi>
generation on the earth. Thus the eighteenth century
was, no doubt, a most important time in the
history even of art, but where noble thirteenth century
churches have been dressed up and loaded with
eighteenth century additions, I cannot think the
historical value of these additions, as evidence of
the taste or the history of their age, counterbalances
their artistic mischievousness, and I sympathize with
the nations who take them away. Of course, this
principle may be overdriven, and has been often
abused. Against such abuses the remarks of the
great critic to whom I refer are a very salutary
protest. But that any barbarous or unsightly deforming
of great artistic monuments is to be protected
on historical grounds—this is a principle of
which neither his genius nor his sneers will convince
me. As for the charge of pedantry, no charge is
more easily made, but no charge is more easily
retorted.

<p>
Strangely enough, his theory of the absolute
sanctity of old brick and mortar nearly agrees in
results with the absolute carelessness about such
<pb n='96'/><anchor id='Pg096'/>things, which is the peculiarity of his special enemies,
the Turks. The Turks, according to Dodwell,
who is a most trustworthy witness, never destroyed
the old buildings unless they wanted them for masonry.
He tells us not to believe that the figures
of the remaining pediment were used as targets by
the Turkish soldiers—a statement often made in his
day. However that may be, I have little doubt,
from what I saw myself, that Greek soldiers in the
present day might so use them. But the Turks did
take down some pillars of the Propylæa while Dodwell
was there, for building purposes, an occurrence
which gave that excellent observer the opportunity
of noting the old Greek way of fitting the
drums of the pillars together. He even got into his
possession one of the pieces of cypress wood used
as plugs between the stone masses, and has given a
drawing of it, and explained the method of its use,
in his admirable book.<note place="foot">Other specimens are preserved in the little Turkish house on
the Acropolis, and should be noted by the visitor, who may easily
pass them by.</note>
</p>

<p>
But the same traveller was also present when a
far more determined and systematic attack was made
upon the remaining ruins of the Parthenon. While
he was travelling in the interior, Lord Elgin had
obtained his famous firman from the Sultan to take
down and remove any antiquities or sculptured
stones he might require, and the infuriated Dodwell
<pb n='97'/><anchor id='Pg097'/>saw a set of ignorant workmen, under equally ignorant
overseers, let loose upon the splendid ruins of
the age of Pericles. He speaks with much good
sense and feeling of this proceeding. He is fully
aware that the world would derive inestimable benefit
from the transplanting of these splendid fragments
to a more accessible place, but he cannot find
language strong enough to express his disgust at the
way in which the thing was done. Incredible as
it may appear, Lord Elgin himself seems not to
have superintended the work, but to have left it to
paid contractors, who undertook the job for a fixed
sum. Little as either Turks or Greeks cared for
the ruins, Dodwell says that a pang of grief was
felt through all Athens at the desecration, and that
the contractors were obliged to bribe workmen with
additional wages to undertake the ungrateful task.
He will not even mention Lord Elgin by name, but
speaks of him with disgust as <q>the person</q> who
defaced the Parthenon. He believes that had this
person been at Athens himself, his underlings could
hardly have behaved in the reckless way they did,
pulling down more than they wanted, and taking no
care to prop up and save the work from which they
had taken the supports.
</p>

<p>
He especially notices their scandalous proceeding
upon taking up one of the great white marble blocks
which form the floor or stylobate of the temple.
They wanted to see what was underneath, and Dod<pb n='98'/><anchor id='Pg098'/>well, who was there, saw the foundation—a substructure
of Peiræic sandstone. But when they had
finished their inspection they actually left the block
they had removed, without putting it back into its
place. So this beautiful pavement, made merely of
closely-fitting blocks, without any artificial or foreign
joinings, was ripped up, and the work of its destruction
begun. I am happy to add that, though a
considerable rent was then made, most of it is still
intact, and the traveller of to-day may still walk on
the very stones which bore the tread of every great
Athenian.
</p>

<p>
The question has often been discussed, whether
Lord Elgin was justified in carrying off this pediment,
the metopes, and the friezes, from their place;
and the Greeks of to-day hope confidently that the
day will come when England will restore these treasures
to their place. This is, of course, absurd, and
it may fairly be argued that people who would bombard
their antiquities in a revolution are not fit
custodians of them in the intervals of domestic
quiet. This was my reply to an old Greek gentleman
who assailed the memory of Lord Elgin with
reproaches. I told him that I was credibly informed
the Greeks had themselves bombarded the
Turks in the Acropolis during the war of liberation,
as several great pieces knocked out and starred on
the western front testify. He confessed, to my
amusement, that he had himself been one of the
<pb n='99'/><anchor id='Pg099'/>assailants, and excused the act by the necessities of
war. I replied that, as the country seemed then
(1875) on the verge of a revolution, the sculptures
might at least remain in the British Museum until a
secure government was established. And this is the
general verdict of learned men on the matter.
They are agreed that it was on the whole a gain to
science to remove the figures, but all stigmatize as
barbarous and shameful the reckless way in which
the work was carried out.
</p>

<p>
I confess I approved of this removal until I came
home from Greece, and went again to see the spoil
in its place in our great Museum. Though there
treated with every care—though shown to the best
advantage, and explained by excellent models of the
whole building, and clear descriptions of their place
on it—notwithstanding all this, the loss that these
wonderful fragments had sustained by being separated
from their place was so terribly manifest—they
looked so unmeaning in an English room, away
from their temple, their country, and their lovely
atmosphere,—that one earnestly wished they had
never been taken from their place, even at the risk
of being made a target by the Greeks or the Turks.
I am convinced, too, that the few who would have
seen them, as intelligent travellers, on their famous
rock, would have gained in quality the advantage
now diffused among many, but weakened and almost
destroyed by the wrench in associations, when the
<pb n='100'/><anchor id='Pg100'/>ornament is severed from its surface, and the decoration
of a temple exhibited apart from the temple
itself. We may admit, then, that it had been better
if Lord Elgin had never taken away these marbles.
Nevertheless, it would be absurd to send them back,
as has recently been advocated (in 1890) by some
ignorant English sentimentalists. But I do think
that the museum on the Acropolis should be provided
with a better set of casts of the figures than
those which are now to be seen there. They look
very wretched, and carelessly prepared.
</p>

<p>
There are, indeed, preserved in the little museum
on the Acropolis the broken remains of the figures
of the eastern pediment, which Morosini and his
Venetians endeavored to take down, as I have
already told. They are little more than pieces of
drapery, of some use in reconstructing the composition,
but of none in judging the effect of that famous
group.
</p>

<p>
But we must not yet enter into this little museum,
which is most properly put out of sight, at the lowest
or east corner of the rock, and which we do not
reach till we have passed through all the ruins. As
the traveller stands at the inner gate of the Propylæa,
he notices at once all the perfect features of
the buildings. Over his head are the enormous
architrave-stones of the Propylæa—blocks of white
marble over twenty-two feet long, which span the
gateway from pillar to pillar. Opposite, above him
<pb n='101'/><anchor id='Pg101'/>and a little to the right, is the mighty Parthenon,
not identical in orientation, as the architects have
observed, with the gateway, but varying from it
slightly, so that sun and shade would play upon it at
moments differing from the rest, and thus produce a
perpetual variety of lights. This principle is observed
in the setting of the <anchor id="corr101"/><corr sic="Erectheum">Erechtheum</corr> also. To
the left, and directly over the town, stands that
beautifully decorated little Ionic temple, or combination
of temples, with the stately Caryatids looking
inwards and towards the Parthenon. These two
buildings are the most perfect examples we have of
their respective styles. We see at first sight the
object of the artists who built them. The one is
the embodiment of majesty, the other of grace.
The very ornaments of the Parthenon are large and
massive; those of the Erechtheum for the most
part intricate and delicate. Accordingly, the Parthenon
is in the Doric style, or rather in the Doric
style so refined and adorned as to be properly called
the Attic style.
</p>

<p>
For the more we study old Athenian art—nay,
even old Athenian character generally—the more
are we convinced that its greatness consists in the
combination of Doric sternness and Ionic grace.
It is hardly a mediation between them; it is the
adoption of the finer elements of both, and the
union of them into a higher harmony. The most
obvious illustration of this is the drama, where the
<pb n='102'/><anchor id='Pg102'/>Ionic element of recitation and the Doric choral
hymn were combined—and let me observe that the
Ionic element was more modified than the Doric.
In the same way Attic architecture used the strength
and majesty of the older style which we see at Corinth
and Pæstum; but relieved it, partly by lighter
proportions, partly by rich decorations, which gave
the nearer observer an additional and different delight,
while from afar the large features were of the
old Doric majesty. Even in the separate decorations,
such as the metopes and friezes, the graceful
women and the long-flowing draperies of the Ionic
school were combined with the muscular nakedness
of the Doric athlete, as represented by Doric
masters. Individual Attic masters worked out
these contrasted types completely, as we may see
by the <hi rend='italic'>Discobolus</hi> of Myron, a contemporary of
Phidias, and the <hi rend='italic'>Apollo Musagetes</hi> of Scopas, who
lived somewhat later.<note place="foot">I speak, of course, of the copies of these famous statues which
are to be seen in the Vatican Museum.</note>
</p>

<p>
In fact, all Athenian character, in its best days,
combined the versatility, and luxury, and fondness
of pleasure, which marked the Ionian, with the
energy, the public spirit, and the simplicity which
was said to mark the better Doric states. The Parthenon
and Erechtheum express all this in visible
clearness. The Athenians felt that the Ionic elegance
and luxury of style was best suited to a small
<pb n='103'/><anchor id='Pg103'/>building; and so they lavished ornament and color
upon this beautiful little house, but made the Doric
temple the main object of all the sacred height.
</p>

<p>
It is worth while to consult the professional architects,
like Revett,<note place="foot">The illustrated work of Michaelis is probably the most complete
and critical account both of the plan and the details, which
have often been discussed, and especially with great accuracy by
Mr. Penrose, whose monumental work, the <hi rend='italic'>Principles of Athenian
Architecture</hi>, has recently been republished. Among the many
newer works, I would call special attention to the first volume of
Viollet-le-duc’s <hi rend='italic'>Entretiens sur l’Architecture</hi>, already translated into
English, which is full of most instructing and suggestive observations
on Greek architecture; also to M. E. Bournouf’s <hi rend='italic'>Acropole
d’Athènes</hi>.</note> who have examined these buildings
with a critical eye. Not only were the old
Athenian architects perfect masters of their materials,
of accurate measurement, of precise correspondence,
of all calculations as to strain and
pressure—they even for artistic, as well as for practical
purposes, deviated systematically from accuracy,
in order that the harmony of the building might
profit by this imperceptible discord. They gave
and took, like a tuner tempering the chords of a
musical instrument. The stylobate is not exactly
level, but curved so as to rise four inches in the
centre; the pillars, which themselves swell slightly
in the middle, are not set perpendicularly, but with
a slight incline inwards: and this effect is given in
the Caryatids by making them rest their weight on
<pb n='104'/><anchor id='Pg104'/>the outer foot at each corner, as Viollet-le-duc has
admirably explained. Again, the separation of the
pillars is less at the corners, and gradually increases
as you approach the centre of the building. The
base of the pediment is not a right line, but is
curved downward. It is not my province to go into
minute details on such points, which can only be
adequately discussed by architects. What I have
here to note is, that the old Greek builders had gone
beyond mere mathematical accuracy and regularity.
They knew a higher law than the slavish repetition
of accurate distances or intervals; they had learned
to calculate effects, to allow for optical illusions;
they knew how to sacrifice real for ideal symmetry.
</p>

<p>
The sculptures of the Parthenon have given rise
to a very considerable literature—so considerable
that the books and treatises upon them now amount
to a respectable library. The example was set by
the architect of the building itself, Ictinus, who wrote
a special treatise on his masterpiece. As is well
known, it was sketched in chalk by the French
painter, Jacques Carrey, a few years before the explosion
of 1687; and though he had but very imperfect
notions of Greek art, and introduced a good
deal of seventeenth century style into the chaste
designs of Phidias, still these drawings, of which
there are copies in the British Museum, are of great
<pb n='105'/><anchor id='Pg105'/>value in helping us to put together the broken and
imperfect fragments which remain.<note place="foot">They will be most readily consulted in the plates of Michaelis’s
<hi rend='italic'>Parthenon</hi>.</note>
</p>

<p>
The sculptured decorations of the building are of
three kinds, or applied in three distinct places. In
the first place, the two triangular <hi rend='italic'>pediments</hi> over the
east and west front were each filled with a group of
statues more than life-size—the one representing
the birth of Athene, and the other her contest with
Poseidon for the patronage of Athens. Some of the
figures from one of these are the great draped headless
women in the centre of the Parthenon room of
the British Museum: other fragments of those
broken by the Venetians are preserved at Athens.
There are, secondly, the <hi rend='italic'>metopes</hi>, or plaques of stone
inserted into the frieze between the triglyphs, and
carved in relief with a single small group on each.
The height of these surfaces does not exceed four
feet. There was, thirdly, a band of reliefs running
all around the external wall at the top of the cella,
inside the surrounding pillars, and opposite to them,
and this is known as the <hi rend='italic'>frieze of the cella</hi>. It consists
of a great Panathenaic procession, starting from
the western front, and proceeding in two divisions
along the parallel north and south walls, till they
meet on the eastern front, which was the proper
front of the temple. Among the Elgin marbles
there are a good many of the metopes, and also of
<pb n='106'/><anchor id='Pg106'/>the pieces of the cella frieze preserved. Several
other pieces of the frieze are preserved at Athens,
and altogether we can reconstruct fully three-fourths
of this magnificent composition.
</p>

<p>
There seems to me the greatest possible difference
in merit between the metopes and the other two
parts of the ornament. The majority of the metopes
which I have seen represent either a Greek and an
Amazon or a Centaur and Lapith, in violent conflict.
It appeared plainly to me that the main object of
these contorted groups was to break in upon the
squareness and straightness of all the other members
of the Doric frieze and architrave. This is admirably
done, as there is no conceivable design which
more completely breaks the stiff rectangles of the
entablature than the various and violent curves of
wrestling figures. But, otherwise, these groups do
not appear to me very interesting, except so far as
everything in such a place, and the work of such
hands, must be interesting.
</p>

<p>
It is very different with the others. Of these the
pediment sculptures—which were, of course, the
most important, and which were probably the finest
groups ever designed—are so much destroyed or
mutilated that the effect of the composition is entirely
lost, and we can only admire the matchless
power and grace of the torsos which remain. The
grouping of the figures was limited, and indicated
by the triangular shape of the surface to be deco<pb n='107'/><anchor id='Pg107'/>rated—standing figures occupying the centre, while
recumbent or stooping figures occupied the ends.
But, as in poetry, where the shackles of rhyme and
metre, which encumber the thoughts of ordinary
writers, are the very source which produces in the
true poet the highest and most precious beauties of
expression; so in sculpture and painting, fixed conditions
seem not to injure, but to enhance and perfect,
the beauty and symmetry attainable in the
highest art. We have apparently in the famous
Niobe group, preserved in Florence, the elements
of a similar composition, perhaps intended to fill
the triangular tympanum of a temple; and even in
these weak Roman copies of a Greek masterpiece
we can see how beautifully the limited space given
to the sculpture determined the beauty and variety
of the figures, and their attitudes. It was in this
genius of grouping that I fancy Phidias chiefly
excelled all his contemporaries: single statues of
Polycletus are said to have been preferred in competitions.
To us the art of the <hi rend='italic'>Discobolus</hi> of Myron
seems fully as great as that of any of the figures of
the Parthenon; but no other artist seems to have
possessed the same architectonic power of adapting
large subjects and processions of figures to their
places as Phidias.<note place="foot">The discovery of the figures from the western pediment of
the temple at Olympia, carved by Alcamenes, a contemporary of
Phidias, will hardly lead us to modify this judgment. For though
they show a great talent in the composition, the defects in execution
are so grave as to lead many critics to suspect that we have
in them the work of mere local artists, certainly not the masterful
hands that adorned the Parthenon.</note> How far he was helped or
<pb n='108'/><anchor id='Pg108'/>advised by Ictinus, or even by Pericles, it is not
easy to say. But I do not fancy that Greek statesmen
in those days studied everything else in the
world besides statecraft, and were known as antiquaries,
and linguists, and <hi rend='italic'>connoisseurs</hi> of china and
paintings, and theologians, and novelists—in fact,
everything under the sun. This many-sidedness,
as they now call it, which the Greeks called <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">πολυπραγμοσύνη</foreign>
and thought to be meddlesomeness, was
not likely to infect Pericles. He was very intimate
with Phidias, and is said to have constantly watched
his work—hardly, I fancy, as an adviser, but rather
as an humble and enthusiastic admirer of an art which
did realize its ideal, while he himself was striving in
vain with rebel forces to attain his object in politics.
</p>

<p>
The extraordinary power of grouping in the
designs of Phidias is, however, very completely
shown us in the better preserved band of the cella
frieze, along which the splendid Panathenaic procession
winds its triumphal way. Over the eastern
doorway were twelve noble sitting figures on either
side of the officiating priest, presenting the state
robe, or <hi rend='italic'>peplos</hi>, for the vestment of Athene. These
figures are explained as gods by the critics; but
they do not in either beauty or dignity, excel those
<pb n='109'/><anchor id='Pg109'/>of many of the Athenians forming the procession.
A very fine slab, containing three of these figures,
is now to be seen in the little museum in the Acropolis.
This group over the main entrance is the end
and summary of all the procession, and corresponds
with the yearly ceremony in this way, that, as the
state entrance, or Propylæa, led into the Acropolis
at the west end, or rear of the Parthenon, the procession
in all probability separated into two, which
went along both sides of the colonnade, and met
again at the eastern door. Accordingly, over the
western end, or rear, the first preparations of the
procession are being made, which then starts along
the north and south walls; the southern being chiefly
occupied with the cavalcade of the Athenian knights,
the northern with the carrying of sacred vessels
and leading of victims for the sacrifice. The frieze
over the western door is still in its place; but, having
lost its bright coloring, and being in any case
at a great height, and only visible from close underneath,
on account of the pillars and architrave in
front, it produces no effect, and is hardly discernible.
Indeed it evidently was never more than an architectural
ornament, in spite of all its artistic beauty.
</p>

<p>
The greater number of the pieces carried away by
Lord Elgin seem taken from the equestrian portion,
in which groups of cantering and curveting horses,
and men in the act of mounting, and striving to
curb restive steeds, are brought together with
extra<pb n='110'/><anchor id='Pg110'/>ordinary effect. We can see plainly how important
a part of Athenian splendor depended upon their
knights, and how true are the hints of Aristophanes
about their social standing and aristocratic
tone. The reins and armor, or at least portions of
it, were laid on in metal, and have accordingly been
long since plundered; nor has any obvious trace
remained of the rich colors with which the whole
was painted. There appears no systematic uniform,
some of the riders being dressed in helmets and
cuirasses, some in felt wide-awakes, and short flying
cloaks. It must remain uncertain whether the
artist did not seek to obtain variety by this deviation
from a fixed dress. There can be no doubt that
Greek art was very bold and free in such matters.
On the other hand, the type of the faces does not
exhibit much variety. At the elevation above the
spectator which this frieze occupied, individual expression
would have been thrown away on figures of
three feet in height: the general dress, and the attitudes,
may have been, when colored, easily discernible.
</p>

<p>
But I confess that this equestrian procession does
not appear to me so beautiful as the rows of figures on
foot (carrying pitchers and other implements, leading
victims, and playing pipes), which seem to come
from the north wall, and of which the most beautiful
slabs are preserved at Athens. Here we can see
best of all that peculiar stamp which shows the age
of Phidias to have been the most perfect in the whole
<pb n='111'/><anchor id='Pg111'/>of Greek sculpture. This statement will not be
accepted readily by the general public. The Apollo
Belvedere, the Capitoline Venus, the Dying Gladiator—these
are what we have been usually taught to
regard as the greatest wonders of Greek plastic art;
and those who have accustomed themselves to this
realistic and sensuous beauty will not easily see the
greatness and the perfection of the solemn and chaste
art of Phidias.

<p>
Nevertheless, it will always be held by men who
have thought long enough on the subject, that the
epoch when Myron and Phidias, Polycletus and
Polygnotus, broke loose from archaic stiffness into
flowing grace was, indeed, the climax of the arts.
There seems a sort of natural law—of slow and
painful origin—of growing development—of sudden
bloom into perfection—of luxury and effeminacy—of
gradual debasement and decay—which affects
almost all the arts as well as most of the growths
of nature. In Greek art particularly this phenomenon
perpetually reappears. There can be little
doubt that the Iliad of Homer was the first and
earliest long creation in poetry, the first attempt,
possibly with the aid of writing, to rise from short
disconnected lays to the greatness of a formal epic.
And despite all its defects of plan, its want of firm
consistency, and its obvious incongruities, this greatest
of all poems has held its place against the more
finished and interesting Odyssey, the more elaborated
<pb n='112'/><anchor id='Pg112'/>Cyclic poems, the more learned Alexandrian epics—in
fact, the first full bloom of the art was by far the
most perfect. It is the same thing with Greek
tragedy. No sooner had the art escaped from the
rude wagon, or stage, or whatever it was, of Thespis,
than we find Æschylus, with imperfect appliances,
with want of experience, with many crudenesses and
defects, a tragic poet never equalled again in Greek
history. Of course the modern critics of his own
country preferred, first Sophocles, and then Euripides—great
poets, as Praxiteles and Lysippus were great
sculptors, and like them, perhaps, greater masters of
human passion and of soul-stirring pathos. But for
all that, Æschylus is <hi rend='italic'>the</hi> tragic poet of the Greeks—the
poet who has reached beyond his age and
nation, and fascinated the greatest men even of our
century, who seek not to turn back upon his great
but not equal rivals. Shelley and Mr. Swinburne
have both made Æschylus their master, and to his
inspiration owe the most splendid of their works.
</p>

<p>
I will not prosecute these considerations further,
though there may be other examples in the history
of art. But I will say this much concerning the
psychological reasons of so strange a phenomenon.
It may, of course, be assumed that the man who
breaks through the old, stiff conventional style
which has bound his predecessors with its shackles
is necessarily a man of strong and original genius.
Thus, when we are distinctly told of Polygnotus that
<pb n='113'/><anchor id='Pg113'/>he first began to vary the features of the human
face from their archaic stiffness, we have before us
a man of bold originality, who quarrelled with the
tradition of centuries, and probably set against him
all the prejudices and the consciences of the graver
public. But to us, far different features seem prominent.
For in spite of all his boldness, when we
compare him with his forerunners, we are struck
with his modesty and devoutness, as compared with
his successors. There is in him, first, a devoutness
toward his work, an old-fashioned piety, which they
had not; and as art in this shape is almost always
a handmaid of religion, this devoutness is a prominent
feature. Next, there is a certain reticence and
modesty in such a man, which arises partly from the
former feeling, but still more from a conservative
fear of violent change, and a healthy desire to make
his work not merely a contrast to, but a development
of, the older traditions. Then the old draped
goddess of religious days, such as the <hi rend='italic'>Venus Genitrix</hi>
in Florence, made way for the splendid but yet more
human handling which we may see in the Venus of
Melos, now in the Louvre. This half-draped but
yet thoroughly new and chaste conception leads
naturally to the type said to have been first dared
by Praxiteles, who did not disguise the use of very
unworthy human models to produce his famous, or
perhaps infamous ideal, which is best known in the
<hi rend='italic'>Venus de Medici</hi>, but perhaps more perfectly
    repre<pb n='114'/><anchor id='Pg114'/>sented in the Venus of the Capitol. There is, too, in
the earlier artist that limited mastery over materials,
which, like the laws of the poet’s language, only
condenses and intensifies the beauty of his work.
</p>

<p>
Such reserve, as compared with the later phases
of the art, is nowhere so strongly shown as in the
matter of <hi rend='italic'>expression</hi>. This is, indeed, the rock on
which most arts have ultimately made shipwreck.
When the power over materials and effects becomes
complete, so that the artist can as it were perform
feats of conquest; when at the same time the feeling
has died out that he is treading upon holy ground,
we have splendid achievements in the way of intense
expression, whether physical or mental, of force, of
momentary action, of grief or joy, which are good
and great, but which lead imitators into a false
track, and so ruin the art which they were thought
to perfect. Thus over-reaching itself, art becomes
an anxious striving after display, and, like an
affected and meretricious woman, repels the sounder
natures which had else been attracted by her beauty.
In Greek art especially, as I have already noticed
in discussing the Attic tomb reliefs, this excess of
expression was long and well avoided, and there is
no stronger and more marked feature in its good
epochs than the reserve of which I have spoken.
It is the chief quality which makes the school of
Phidias matchless. There is in it beauty of form,
there is a good deal of action, there is in the frieze
<pb n='115'/><anchor id='Pg115'/>an almost endless variety; but withal there is the
strictest symmetry, the closest adherence to fixed
types, the absence of all attempt at expressing passing
emotion. There is still the flavor of the old
stiff simplicity about the faces, about the folds of
the robes, about the type of the horses; but the
feeling of the artist shines through the archaic
simplicity with much clearer light than it does in
the more ambitious attempts of the later school.
The greatest works of Phidias—his statue of Zeus
at Elis, and his Athene in the Parthenon—are lost
to us; but the ancients are unanimous that for
simple and sustained majesty no succeeding sculptor,
however brilliant, had approached his ideal.<note place="foot">It is very uncertain, perhaps unlikely, that any of the architectural
sculpture we possess was actually finished by Phidias’s own
hand. But there can be no doubt that he directed it, and must
have designed much of it in detail, since the general composition
was certainly his creation.</note>

We may say almost the same of the great temple
which he adorned with his genius. It is just that
perfection of the Doric temple which has escaped
from the somewhat ponderous massiveness and simplicity
of the older architecture, while it sacrificed
no element of majesty to that grace and delicacy
which marks, later and more developed Greek architecture.
On this Acropolis the Athenians determined
to show what architecture could reach in
majesty and what in delicacy. So they set up the
<pb n='116'/><anchor id='Pg116'/>Parthenon in that absolute perfection where strength
and solidity come out enhanced, but in no way overlaid,
with ornament. They also built the Erechtheum,
where they adopted the Ionic Order, and
covered their entablature with bands of small and
delicate tracing, which, with its gilding and coloring,
was a thing to be studied minutely and from the
nearest distance. Though the inner columns of the
Propylæa were Ionic (and they were very large), it
appears that large temples in that Order were not
known in Attica. But for small and graceful buildings
it was commonly used, and of these the Erechtheum
was the most perfect.
</p>

<p>
In its great days, and even as Pausanias saw it,
the Acropolis was covered with statues, as well as
with shrines. It was not merely an Holy of Holies
in religion; it was also a palace and museum of art.
At every step and turn the traveller met new objects
of interest. There were archaic specimens, chiefly
interesting to the antiquarian and the devotee; there
were the great masterpieces which were the joint
admiration of the artist and the vulgar. Even all
the sides and slopes of the great rock were honeycombed
into sacred grottos, with their altars and
their gods, or studded with votive monuments. All
these lesser things are fallen away and gone; the
sacred caves are filled with rubbish and desecrated
with worse than neglect. The grotto of Pan and
Apollo is difficult of access, and was, when I first
<pb n='117'/><anchor id='Pg117'/>saw it, an object of disgust rather than of interest.
There are left but the remnants of the surrounding
wall, and the ruins of the three principal buildings,
which were the envy and wonder of all the civilized
world.
</p>

<p>
The walls are particularly well worth studying,
as there are to be found in them specimens of all
kinds of building, beginning from prehistoric times.
There is even plain evidence that the builders of the
age of Pericles were not by any means the best wall
builders; for the masonry of the wall called the
Wall of Themistocles, which is well preserved in
the lowest part of the course along the north slope,
is by far the most beautifully finished work of the
kind which can anywhere be seen: and it seems to
correspond accurately to the lower strata of the
foundations on which the Parthenon was built. The
builders of Pericles’s time added a couple of layers
of stone to raise the site of the temple, and their
work contrasts curiously in its roughness with the
older platform. Any one who will note the evident
admiration of Thucydides for the walls built round
the Peiræus by the men of an earlier generation will
see good reason for this feeling when they examine
these details.
</p>

<p>
The beautiful little temple of Athena Nike, though
outside the Propylæa—thrust out as it were on a
sort of great bastion high on the right as you enter—must
still be called a part, and a very striking
<pb n='118'/><anchor id='Pg118'/>part, of the Acropolis. It is only of late years that
the site has been cleared of rubbish and modern
stonework, and the temple rebuilt from the original
materials, thus destroying, no doubt, some precious
traces of Turkish occupation which the fastidious
historian may regret, but realizing to us a beautiful
Greek temple of the Ionic Order in some completeness.
The peculiarity of this building, which is
perched upon a platform of stone and commands a
splendid prospect, is, that its tiny peribolus, or
sacred enclosure, was surrounded by a parapet of
stone slabs covered with exquisite reliefs of winged
Victories, in various attitudes. Some of these slabs
are now in the Museum of the Acropolis, and are of
great interest—apparently less severe than the
school of Phidias, and therefore later in date, but
still of the best epoch and of marvellous grace.
The position of this temple also is not parallel with
the Propylæa, but turned slightly outward, so that
the light strikes it at moments when the other building
is not illuminated. At the opposite side is a
very well preserved chamber, and a fine colonnade
at right angles with the gate, which looks like a
guard-room. This is the chamber commonly called
the Pinacotheca, where Pausanias saw pictures of
frescoes by Polygnotus.
</p>

<p>
Of the two museums on the Acropolis, the principal
one requires little comment and is very easily
seen and appreciated. In an ante-room are the
<pb n='119'/><anchor id='Pg119'/>archaic figures of which I have already spoken,
with the remains taken from about the Parthenon,
together with casts of the Elgin marbles, and many
small and beautiful reliefs, apparently belonging to
votive monuments. There are also two figures of
young men, with the heads and feet lost, which are
of peculiarly beautiful Parian marble, and of very
fine workmanship. But the visitor is very likely
to pass by the little Turkish house, which is well
worth a visit, for here are the cypress plugs from
the pillars of the Parthenon or Propylæa; here are
also splendid specimens of archaic vases, such as are
very hard indeed to find in any other collection.
The large jars from Melos which are here to be
seen have the most striking resemblance in their
decoration to the fragment of a similar vessel, with
a row of armed figures round it, which was found
at Mycenæ, and is now in the Ministry of Public
Instruction. Lastly, there stands in the window a
very delicately worked little Satyr, as the pointed
ears and tail show, but of voluptuous form—rather
of the hermaphrodite type: there is hardly a better
preserved statuette than this anywhere at Athens.
It seemed a pity that such a gem should be hidden
away in so obscure a place; and I hope that by this
time it has been brought into the larger and official
museum.
</p>

<p>
I will venture to conclude this chapter with a curious
comparison. It was my good fortune, a few
<pb n='120'/><anchor id='Pg120'/>months after I had seen the Acropolis, to visit a
rock in Ireland, which, to my great surprise, bore
many curious analogies to it—I mean the rock of
Cashel. Both were strongholds of religion—honored
and hallowed above all other places in their
respective countries—both were covered with buildings
of various dates, each representing peculiar
ages and styles in art. And as the Greeks, I suppose
for effect’s sake, have varied the posture of
their temples, so that the sun illumines them at different
moments, the old Irish have varied the orientation
of their churches that the sun might rise
directly over against the east window on the anniversary
of the patron saint. There is at Cashel the
great Cathedral—in loftiness and grandeur the Parthenon
of the place; there is the smaller and more
beautiful Cormac’s Chapel, the holiest of all, like
the Erechtheum at Athens. Again, the great sanctuary
upon the Rock of Cashel was surrounded by
a cluster of abbeys about its base, which were
founded there by pious men on account of the greatness
and holiness of the archiepiscopal seat. Of
these, one remains, like the Theseum at Athens,
eclipsed by the splendor of the Acropolis.
</p>

<p>
The prospect from the Irish sanctuary has, indeed,
endless contrasts to that from the pagan stronghold,
but they are suggestive contrasts, and such as are
not without a certain harmony. The plains around
both are framed by mountains, of which the Irish
<pb n='121'/><anchor id='Pg121'/>are probably the more picturesque; and if the light
upon the Greek hills is the fairest, the native color
of the Irish is infinitely more rich. So, again, the
soil of Attica is light and dusty, whereas the Golden
Vale of Tipperary is among the richest and greenest
in the world. Still, both places were the noblest
homes, each in their own country, of religions which
civilized, humanized, and exalted the human race;
and if the Irish Acropolis is left in dim obscurity
by the historical splendor of the Parthenon, on the
other hand, the gods of the Athenian stronghold
have faded out before the moral greatness of the
faith preached from the Rock of Cashel.

<p>
There are few recent excavations about Athens
which have been so productive as those along the
south slope of the Acropolis. In the conflicts and
the wear of ages a vast quantity of earth, and walls,
and fragments of buildings has either been cast, or
has rolled, down this steep descent, so that it was
with a certainty of good results that the Archæological
Society of Athens undertook to clear this side
of the rock of all the accumulated rubbish. Several
precious inscriptions were found, which had
been thrown down from the rock; and in April,
1884, the whole plan of the temple of Æsculapius
had been uncovered, and another step attained in
fixing the much disputed topography of this part of
Athens.
</p>

<p>
And yet we can hardly call this a beginning.
Some twenty-five years ago, a very extensive and
splendidly successful excavation was made on an adjoining
site, when a party of German archæologists
laid bare the Theatre of Dionysus—the great theatre
in which Æschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides brought
<pb n='123'/><anchor id='Pg123'/>out their immortal plays before an immortal audience.
There is nothing more delightful than to descend
from the Acropolis, and rest awhile in the
comfortable marble arm-chairs with which the front
row of the circuit is occupied. They are of the
pattern usual with the sitting portrait statues of
the Greeks—very deep, and with a curved back,
which exceeds both in comfort and in grace any
chairs designed by modern workmen.<note place="foot">This very pattern, in mahogany, with cane seats, and adapted,
like all Greek chairs, for loose cushions, was often used in eighteenth
century work, and may still be found in old Irish mansions
furnished at that epoch.</note> Each chair
has the name of a priest inscribed on it, showing
how the theatre among the Greeks corresponded to
our cathedral, and this front row to the stalls of
canons and prebendaries.

<p>
But unfortunately all this sacerdotal prominence
is probably the work of the later restorers of the
theatre. For after having been first beautified and
adorned with statues by Lycurgus (in Demosthenes’s
time), it was again restored and embellished by
Herodes Atticus, or about his time, so that the theatre,
as we now have it, can only be called the
building of the second or third century after Christ.
The front wall of the stage, which is raised some
feet above the level of the empty pit, is adorned
with a row of very elegant sculptures, amongst
which one—a shaggy old man, in a stooping posture,
<pb n='124'/><anchor id='Pg124'/>represented as coming out from within, and holding
up the stone above him—is particularly striking.
Some Greek is said to have knocked off, by way of
amusement, the heads of most of these figures since
they were discovered, but this I do not know upon
any better authority than ordinary report. The pit
or centre of the theatre is empty, and was never in
Greek days occupied by seats, but a wooden structure
was set up in advance of the stage, and on this
the chorus performed their dances and sang their
odes. But now there is a circuit of upright slabs
of stone close to the front seats, which can hardly
have been an arrangement of the old Greek theatre.
They are generally supposed to have been added
when the building came to be used for contests of
gladiators, which Dion Chrysostom tells us were imported
from Corinth in his day.
</p>

<p>
All these later additions and details are, I fear,
calculated to detract from the reader’s interest in
this theatre, which I should indeed regret—for
nothing can be more certain than that this is the
veritable stone theatre which was built when the
wooden one broke down, at the great competition of
Æschylus and Pratinas; and though front seats may
have been added, and slight modifications introduced,
the general structure can never have required alteration.
The main body of the curved rows of seats
have no backs, but are so deep as to leave plenty of
room for the feet of the people next above; and I
<pb n='125'/><anchor id='Pg125'/>fancy that in the old times the
    <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">προεδρία</foreign> or right of
sitting in the front rows was not given to priests,
but to foreign embassies, along with the chief magistrates
of Athens. The cost of admission was two
obols to all the seats of the house not specially reserved,
and such reservation was only for persons
of official rank, and by no means for richer people,
or for a higher entrance money—a thing which
would not have been tolerated, I believe, for an
instant by the Athenian democracy.<note place="foot">I state this because many critics have drawn an opposite inference
from a mistranslation of a passage in Plato (<hi rend='italic'>Apol.</hi> 26, E).</note> When the
state treasury grew full with the tribute of the subject
cities, the citizens had this sum, and at times
even more, distributed to them in order that no one
might be excluded from the annual feast, and so the
whole free population of Athens came together without
expense to worship the gods by enjoying themselves
in this great theatre.
</p>

<p>
It is indeed very large, though exaggerated statements
have been made about its size. It is generally
stated that the enormous number of thirty
thousand people could fit into it—a statement I think
incredible;<note place="foot">The exact number, according to Papadakis (cf. A. Müller,
<hi rend='italic'><anchor id="corr125"/><corr sic="Bühnenalt">Bühnenalt.</corr></hi>, p. 47), is stated at 27,500. But I am convinced this is
a great exaggeration. I should rather give 15,000 as a liberal
estimate; and this agrees with the measurements made for me
by Dr. Dörpfeld in 1889. This mistake is also due to misunderstanding
a passage in Plato’s <hi rend='italic'>Symposium</hi>, which says that
<q>Agathon, whom 30,000 citizens hear——</q>. It is not said that
they heard him at the same time.</note> and it is not nearly as large as other
<pb n='126'/><anchor id='Pg126'/>theatres I have seen, at Syracuse, at Megalopolis, or
even at Argos. This also is certain, that any one
speaking on the stage, as it now is, can be easily
and distinctly heard by people sitting on the highest
row of seats now visible, which cannot, I fancy,
have been far from the original top of the house.
Such a thing were impossible where thirty thousand
people, or a crowd approaching that number, were
seated. We hear, however, that the old actors had
recourse to various artificial means of increasing the
range of their voices, which shows that in some
theatres the difficulty was felt; and in the extant
plays, <hi rend='italic'>asides</hi> are so rare<note place="foot">Cf. on this point my <hi rend='italic'>History of Greek Literature</hi>, i. p. 345.</note> that it must have been difficult
to give them with effect.
</p>

<p>
In one respect, however, the voice must have been
more easily heard through the old house than it now
is through the ruins. The back of the stage was
built up with a high wooden structure to represent
fixed scenes, and even a sort of upper story on which
gods and flying figures sometimes appeared—an
arrangement which of course threw the voice forward
into the theatre. There used to be an old
idea, not perhaps yet extinct, that the Greek audiences
had the lovely natural scenery of their country
for their stage decoration, and that they embraced in
one view the characters on the stage, and the coasts
<pb n='127'/><anchor id='Pg127'/>and islands for miles behind them. Nothing can be
more absurd, or more opposed to Greek feeling on
such matters. In the first place, as is well known,
a feeling for the beauty of landscape as such was
almost foreign to the Greeks, who never speak of
the picturesque in their literature without special
relation to the sounds of nature, or to the intelligences
which were believed to pervade and animate
it: a fine view as such had little attraction for them.
In the second place, they came to the theatre to
enjoy poetry, and the poetry of character, of passion,
of the relation of man and his destiny to the
course of Divine Providence and Divine justice—in
short, to assume a frame of mind perfectly inconsistent
with the distractions of landscape. For that
purpose they had their stage, as we now know, filled
in at the back with high painted scenes, which
in earlier days were made of light woodwork and
canvas, to bear easy removal, or change, but which
in most Græco-Roman theatres, like the very perfect
one at Aspendus, or indeed that of Herodes
Atticus close by at Athens, were a solid structure
of at least two stories high, which absolutely excluded
all prospect.
</p>

<p>
But even had the Athenians not been protected
by this arrangement from outer disturbance, I found
by personal investigation that there was no view for
them to enjoy! Except from the highest tiers, and
therefore from the worst places, the sea and islands
<pb n='128'/><anchor id='Pg128'/>are not visible, and the only view to be obtained,
supposing that houses did not obstruct it, would
have been the dull, somewhat bleak, undulating
hills which stretch between the theatre and Phalerum.
</p>

<p>
The back scenes of the Greek theatres were
painted as ours are, and at first, I suppose, very
rudely indeed, for we hear particularly of a certain
Agatharchus, who developed the art of scene-painting
by adopting perspective.<note place="foot">Cf. on the details of Greek painting the last chapter of my
<hi rend='italic'>Social Life in Greece</hi>.</note> The other appurtenances
of the Greek theatre were equally rude, or
perhaps I should say equally stiff and conventional,
and removed from any attempt to reproduce ordinary
life—at least this was the case with their tragedy,
their satyric dramas, and their older comedy, which
dealt in masks, in fixed stage dresses, in tragic padding,
and stuffing-out to an unnatural size, in comic
distortions and indecent emblems—in all manner of
conventional ugliness, we should say, handed down
from the first religious origin of these performances,
and maintained with that strict conservatism which
marks the course of all great Greek art. The stage
was long and narrow, the means of changing scenes
cumbrous and not frequently employed; the number
of the actors in tragedy strictly limited—four is
an unusual number, exceptionally employed in the
second <hi rend='italic'>Œdipus</hi> of Sophocles. In fact, we cannot
<pb n='129'/><anchor id='Pg129'/>say that the Greek drama ever became externally
like ours till the comedies of Menander and his
school. These poets, living in an age when serious
interests had decayed, when tragedy had ceased to
be religious, and comedy political, when neither was
looked upon any longer as a great public engine of
instruction or of censure, turned to pictures of social
life, not unlike our genteel comedy; and in this
species of drama we may assert that the Greeks,
except perhaps for masks, imitated the course of
ordinary life.
</p>

<p>
It is indeed said of Euripides, the real father of
this new comedy, that he brought down the tragic
stage from ideal heroism to the passions and meannesses
of ordinary men; and Sophocles, his rival,
the supposed perfection of an Attic tragedian, is
reputed to have observed that he himself had represented
men as they ought to be, Euripides as they
were. But any honest reader of Euripides will see
at once how far he too is removed from the ordinary
realisms of life. He saw, indeed, that human passion
is the subject, of all others, which will permanently
interest human thought; he felt that the insoluble
problems of Free Will and Fate, of the mercy and
the cruelty of Providence, were too abstract on the
one hand, and too specially Greek on the other;
that, after all, human nature as such is the great
universal field on which any age can reach the
sympathy and the interest of its remotest successors.
<pb n='130'/><anchor id='Pg130'/>But the passions painted by Euripides were no
ordinary passions—they were great and unnatural
crimes, forced upon suffering mortals by the action
of hostile deities; the virtues of Euripides were no
ordinary virtues—they were great heroic self-sacrifices,
and showed the Divine element in our nature,
which no tyranny of circumstances can efface. His
Phædra and Medea on the one hand, his Alcestis
and Iphigenia on the other, were strictly characters
as they ought to be in tragedy, and not as they
commonly are in life; and in outward performance
Euripides did not depart from the conventional stiffness,
from the regular development, from the somewhat
pompous and artificial dress in which tragedy
had been handed down to him by his masters.
</p>

<p>
They, too, had not despised human nature—how
could they? Both Æschylus and Sophocles were great
painters of human character, as well in its passions as in
its reasonings. But the former had made it accessory,
so to speak, to the great religious lessons which he
taught; the latter had at least affected to do so, or
imagined that he did, while really the labyrinths of
human character had enticed and held him in their
endless maze. Thus, all through Greek tragedy
there was on the one hand a strong element of conventional
stiffness, of adherence to fixed subjects,
and scenes, and masks, and dresses—of adherence
to fixed metres, and regular dialogues, where question
and answer were balanced line for line, and the
<pb n='131'/><anchor id='Pg131'/>cast of characters was as uniform as it is in the
ordinary Italian operas of our own day. But on the
other hand, these tragic poets were great masters of
expression, profound students not only of the great
world problems, but of the problems of human nature,
exquisite masters too of their language, not only in
its dramatic force, but in its lyric sweetness; they
summed up in their day all that was great and
beautiful in Greek poetry, and became the fullest
and ripest fruit of that wonderful tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, which even now makes those
that taste it to be as gods.
</p>

<p>
Such, then, were the general features of the
tragedy which the Athenian public, and the married
women, including many strangers, assembled to witness
in broad daylight under the Attic sky. They
were not sparing of their time. They ate a good
breakfast before they came. They ate sweetmeats
in the theatre when the acting was bad. Each play
was short, and there was doubtless an interval of
rest. But it is certain that each poet contended
as a rule with four plays against his competitors;
and as there were certainly three of them, there
must have been twelve plays acted; this seems to
exceed the endurance of any public, even allowing
two days for the performance. We are not fully
informed on these points. We do not even know
how Sophocles, who contended with single plays,
managed to compete against Euripides, who
con<pb n='132'/><anchor id='Pg132'/>tended with sets of four. But we know that the
judges were chosen by lot, and we strongly suspect,
from the records of their decisions, that they often
decided wrongly. We also know that the poets
sought to please the audience by political and
patriotic allusions, and to convey their dislike of
opposed cities or parties by drawing their representatives
in odious colors on the stage. Thus
Euripides is never tired of traducing the Spartans
in the character of Menelaus. Æschylus fights the
battle of the Areopagus in his <hi rend='italic'>Eumenides</hi>.
</p>

<p>
But besides all this, it seems that tragic poets were
regarded as the proper teachers of morality, and that
the stage among the Greeks occupied somewhat the
place of the modern pulpit. This is the very attitude
which Racine assumes in the Preface to his <hi rend='italic'>Phèdre</hi>.
He suggests that it ought to be considered the best
of his plays, because there is none in which he has
so strictly rewarded virtue and punished vice.<note place="foot">The actual passage is well worth quoting—<q>Au reste, je n’ose
encore ajouter que cette pièce soit en effet la meilleure de mes
tragédies. Je laisse et aux lecteurs et au temps à décider de son
véritable prix. Ce que je puis assurer, c’est que je n’en ai point
fait où la vertu soit plus mise en jour que dans celle-ci; les
moindres fautes y sont sévèrement punies; la seule pensée du
crime y est regardée avec autant d’horreur que le crime même;
les faiblesses de l’amour y passent pour des vraies faiblesses; les
passions n’y sont présentées aux yeux que pour montrer tous les
désordres dont elles sont causes, et le vice y est peint partout avec
des couleurs qui en out fait connaître et haïr la difformité. C’est
là proprement le but que tout homme qui travaille pour le public
se doit proposer; et c’est que les premiers poètes tragiques avaient
en vue sur toute chose. Leur théâtre était une école où la vertu
n’était pas moins bien enseignée que dans les écoles des philosophes....
Il serait à souhaiter que nos ouvrages fussent aussi
solides et aussi pleins d’utiles instructions que ceux de ces poètes.
Ce serait peut-être un moyen de réconcilier la tragédie avec quantité
de personnes célèbres par leur piété et par leur doctrine, qui l’ont
condamnée dans ces derniers temps, et qui en jugeraient sans doute
plus favorablement, si les auteurs songeaient autant à instruire les
spectateurs qu’à les divertir, et s’ils suivaient en cela la véritable
intention de la tragédie.</q></note> He
<pb n='133'/><anchor id='Pg133'/>alters, in his <hi rend='italic'>Iphigénie</hi>, the Greek argument from
which he copied, because as he tells us (again in the
Preface) it would never do to have so virtuous a
person as Iphigenia sacrificed. This, however,
would not have been a stumbling-block to the
Greek poet, whose capricious and spiteful gods, or
whose deep conviction of the stain of an ancestral
curse, would justify catastrophies which the Christian
poet, with his trust in a benevolent Providence,
could not admit. But, indeed, in most other points
the so-called imitations of the Greek drama by
Racine and his school are anything but imitations.
The main characters and the general outline of the
plot are no doubt borrowed. The elegance and
power of the dialogue are more or less successfully
copied. But the natural and familiar scenes, which
would have been shocking to the court of Louis
XIV.—<q>ces scenes entremêlées de bas comique, et
ces fréquents exemples de mauvais ton et d’une
<pb n='134'/><anchor id='Pg134'/>familiarité choquante,</q> as Barthélémy says—such
characters as the guard in the <hi rend='italic'>Antigone</hi>, the nurse
in the <hi rend='italic'>Choephorœ</hi>, the Phrygian in the <hi rend='italic'>Orestes</hi>, were
carefully expunged. Moreover, love affairs and
court intrigues were everywhere introduced, and
the language was never allowed to descend from its
pomp and grandeur. Most of the French dramatists
were indeed bad Greek scholars,<note place="foot">Racine is here the exception.</note> and knew the plays
from which they copied either through very poor
translations, or through the rhetorical travesties surviving
under the name of Seneca, which were long
thought fully equal to the great and simple originals.
</p>

<p>
So the French of the seventeenth century, starting
from these half-understood models, and applying
rigidly the laws of tragedy which they had deduced,
with questionable logic, from that very untrustworthy
guide, our text of the <hi rend='italic'>Poetics</hi> of Aristotle, created
a drama which became so unlike what it professed
to imitate, that most good modern French critics
have occupied themselves with showing the contrasts
of old Greek tragedy to that of the modern stage.
They are always praising the <hi rend='italic'>naiveté</hi>, the familiarity,
the irregularity of the old dramatists; they are
always noting touches of common life and of ordinary
motive quite foreign to the dignity of Racine,
and Voltaire, and Alfieri.<note place="foot">Alfieri, though starting with a violent feeling of reaction
against some of the faults of the French drama, was wholly
trained upon it, and only knew the Greek plays through French
versions until very late in life, when most of his works were
already published. I therefore class him unhesitatingly as an
offshoot of that school.</note> They think that the real
<pb n='135'/><anchor id='Pg135'/>parallel is to be found not among them, but in
Shakespeare. Thus their education makes them
emphasize the very qualities which we admit, but
should not cite, as the peculiarities of Greek
tragedy. <hi rend='italic'>We</hi> are rather struck with its conventionalities,
with its strict adherence to fixed form,
with its somewhat stilted diction, and we wonder
how it came to be so great and natural within these
trammels.
</p>

<p>
Happily the tendency in our own day to reproduce
antiquity faithfully, and not in modern recasting, has
led to the translating, and even to the representing,
of Greek tragedies in their purity, and it does not
require a knowledge of Greek to obtain some real
acquaintance with these great masterpieces. Mr.
and Mrs. Browning, Dean Milman, Mr. Fitzgerald,
Mr. Whitelaw, and many others, have placed faithful
and elegant versions within our reach. But since
I have cautioned the reader not versed in Greek
against adopting Racine’s or Alfieri’s plays as adequate
substitutes, I venture to give the same advice
concerning the more Greek and antique plays of Mr.
Swinburne, which, in spite of their splendor, are
still not really Greek plays, but modern plays based
on Greek models. The relief produced by ordinary
<pb n='136'/><anchor id='Pg136'/>talk from ordinary characters, which has been already
noticed, is greatly wanting in his very lofty,
and perhaps even strained, dialogue. Nor are his
choruses the voice of the vulgar public, combining
high sentiments with practical meanness, but elaborate
and very difficult speculations, which comment
metaphysically on the general problems of the play.
There is nothing better worth reading than the
<hi rend='italic'>Atalanta in Calydon</hi>. The Greek scholar sees
everywhere how thoroughly imbued the author is
with Greek models. But it will not give to the
mere English reader any accurate idea of a real
Greek tragedy. He must go to <hi rend='italic'>Balaustion’s Adventure</hi>,
or <hi rend='italic'>Aristophanes’s Apology</hi>, or some other professed
translation, and follow it line for line, adding
some such general reviews as the <hi rend='italic'>Etudes</hi> of M. Patin.
</p>

<p>
As for revivals of Greek plays, it seems to me
not likely that they will ever succeed. The French
imitations of Racine laid hold of the public because
they were not imitations. And as for us nowadays,
who are more familiar with the originals, a faithless
reproduction would shock us, while a literal one
would weary us. This at least is the effect which
the <hi rend='italic'>Antigone</hi> produces, even with the modern choruses
of Mendelssohn to relieve the slowness of the
action. But, of course, a reproduction of the old
chorus would be simply impossible. The whole pit
in the theatre of Dionysus seems to have been left
empty. A part somewhat larger than our orchestra
<pb n='137'/><anchor id='Pg137'/>was covered with a raised platform, though still
lower than the stage.<note place="foot">There is now (1891) a controversy raging concerning the height
of the Greek stage and its arrangements, owing to the researches
of Dr. Dörpfeld. I cannot enter upon it here.</note> Upon this the chorus danced
and sang and looked on at the actors, as in the play
within the play in <hi rend='italic'>Hamlet</hi>. Above all, they constantly
prayed to their gods, and this religious side
of the performance has of course no effect upon us.<note place="foot">This was written before the very interesting revivals of Greek
plays which do such honor to Cambridge. Those who had the
privilege of seeing them can judge not only how far a reproduction
was possible, but how far it can succeed, for never will it be
more ably undertaken and carried out.</note>
</p>

<p>
As to old Attic comedy, it would be even more
impossible to recover it for a modern public. Its
local and political allusions, its broad and coarse
humor, its fantastic dresses, were features which
made it not merely ancient and Greek, but Athenian,
and Athenian of a certain epoch. Without the
Alexandrian scholiasts, who came in time to recover
and note down most of the allusions, these comedies
would be to the Greek scholar of to-day hardly
intelligible. The new Attic comedy, of which Terence
is a copy, is indeed on a modern basis, and may
be faithfully reproduced, if not admired, in our day.
But here, alas! the great originals of Menander,
Philemon, and Diphilus are lost to us, and we must
be content with the Latin accommodations.
</p>

<p>
But I have delayed too long over these Greek
<pb n='138'/><anchor id='Pg138'/>plays, and must apologize for leading away the
reader from the actual theatre in which he is sitting.
Yet there is hardly a place in Athens which calls
back the mind so strongly to the old days, when all
the crowd came jostling in, and settled down in their
seats, to hear the great novelties of the year from
Sophocles or Euripides. No doubt there were
cliques and cabals and claqueurs, noisy admirers
and cold critics, the supporters of the old, and the
lovers of the new, devotees and skeptics, wondering
foreigners and self-complacent citizens. They little
thought how we should come, not only to sit in the
seats they occupied, but to reverse the judgments
which they pronounced, and correct with sober
temper the errors of prejudice, of passion, and of
pride.
</p>

<p>
Plato makes Socrates say, in his <hi rend='italic'>Apologia</hi> (<hi rend="italic">pro
vita sua</hi>), that a copy of Anaxagoras could be
bought on the orchestra, when very dear, for a
drachme, that is to say for about 9d. of our money,
which may then have represented our half-crown or
three shillings in value.<note place="foot">The reader who cares to consult the various prices cited in my
<hi rend='italic'>Old Greek Life</hi> will see the grounds for assuming some such change
in the value of money between the fourth century <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi> in Greece
and the nineteenth <hi rend='small'>A. D.</hi> in England.</note> The commentators have
made desperate attempts to explain this. Some say
the orchestra was used as a book-stall when plays
were not going on—an assumption justified by no
<pb n='139'/><anchor id='Pg139'/>other hint in Greek literature. Others have far
more absurdly imagined that Plato really meant you
could pay a drachme for the best seat in the theatre,
and read the writings of Anaxagoras in a fashionable
play of Euripides, who was his friend and follower.
Verily a wonderful interpretation!
</p>

<p>
If the reader will walk with me from the theatre
of Dionysus past the newly excavated site of the
temple of Æsculapius, and past the Roman-Greek
theatre which was erected by Hadrian or Herodes
Atticus, I will show him what Plato meant. Of
course, this later theatre, with its solid Roman back
scenes of masonry, is equally interesting with the
Theatre of Dionysus to the advocates of the unity
of history! But to us who are content to study
Greek Athens, it need not afford any irrelevant delays.
Passing round the approach to the Acropolis,
we come on to a lesser hill, separated from it by a
very short saddle, so that it looks like a sort of outpost
or spur sent out from the rock of the Acropolis.
This is the Areopagus—Mars’ Hill—which we can
ascend in a few minutes. There are marks of old
staircases cut in the rock. There are underneath,
on our left and right, as we go up, deep black caverns,
once the home of the Eumenides. On the flat
top there are still some signs of a rude smoothing
of the stone for seats. Under us, to the north-west,
is the site of the old <hi rend='italic'>agora</hi>, once surrounded with
colonnades, the crowded market-place of all those
<pb n='140'/><anchor id='Pg140'/>who bought and sold and talked. But on the descent
from the Areopagus, and, now at least, not
much higher than the level of the market-place beneath,
there is a small semicircular platform, backed
by the rising rock. This, or some platform close to
it, which may now be hidden by accumulated soil,
was the old <hi rend='italic'>orchestra</hi>, possibly the site of the oldest
theatre, but in historical times a sort of reserved
platform, where the Athenians, who had their town
bristling with statues, allowed no monument to be
erected save the figures of Harmodius and Aristogiton,
which were carried into Persia, replaced by
others, afterwards recovered, and of which we may
have a copy in the two fighting figures, of archaic
character, now in the Museum of Naples. It was
doubtless on this orchestra, just above the bustle and
thoroughfare of the <hi rend='italic'>agora</hi>, that booksellers kept their
stalls, and here it was that the book of <anchor id="corr140"/><corr sic="Anaxgoras">Anaxagoras</corr>
could be bought for a drachme.
</p>

<p>
Here then was the place where that physical philosophy
was disseminated which first gained a few
advanced thinkers; then, through Euripides, leavened
the drama, once the exponent of ancient piety;
then, through the stage, the Athenian public, till we
arrive at those Stoics and Epicureans who came to
teach philosophy and religion not as a faith, but as a
system, and to spend their time with the rest of the
public in seeking out novelties of creed and of
opinion as mere fashions with which people choose
<pb n='141'/><anchor id='Pg141'/>to dress their minds. And it was on this very Areopagus,
where we are now standing, that these philosophers
of fashion came into contact with the thorough
earnestness, the profound convictions, the red-hot
zeal of the Apostle Paul. The memory of that
great scene still lingers about the place, and every
guide will show you the exact place where the
Apostle stood, and in what direction he addressed his
audience. There are, I believe, even some respectable
commentators, who transfer their own estimate
of S. Paul’s importance to the Athenian public, and
hold that it was before the <hi rend='italic'>court</hi> of the Areopagus
that he was asked to expound his views.<note place="foot">I perceive that M. Renan, who alone of skeptical critics
is persuaded, possibly by the striking picturesqueness of the
scene, to accept it as historical, considers it not impossible that
S. Paul may have been actually brought before the court. He
notices that in later days it assumed a general direction not only
of literature, but of morals, and that any new teacher might fairly
have been summoned before it to expound his views. This does
not seem to me to agree with the ironical and trivial character of
the whole audience, as intimated by the historian. The author of
the work called <hi rend='italic'>Supernatural Religion</hi>, when analyzing, in his third
volume, the Acts of the Apostles, is actually silent on this speech,
though he discusses at great length the speeches of S. Paul which he
thinks composed as parallels to those of S. Peter. Most German
critics look on the passage as introduced by the author, like the
speeches in Thucydides or Tacitus, as a literary ornament, as well as
an exposition of the Apostolic preaching of the early Church. They
also note its many contrasts to the teaching of such documents as
the Epistle to the Romans. I have assumed, as even M. Renan
seems to do, that the Apostle told Timothy, or Luke, or some other
follower, the main purport of this memorable visit, and also the
headings of the speech, which is too unlike his received writings
to be a probable forgery.</note> This is
<pb n='142'/><anchor id='Pg142'/>more than doubtful. The <hi rend='italic'>blases</hi> philosophers, who
probably yawned over their own lectures, hearing of
a new lay preacher, eager to teach and apparently
convinced of the truth of what he said, thought the
novelty too delicious to be neglected, and brought
him forthwith out of the chatter and bustle of the
crowd, probably past the very orchestra where
Anaxagoras’s books had been proselytizing before
him, and where the stiff old heroes of Athenian history
stood, a monument of the escape from political
slavery. It is even possible that the curious knot
of idlers did not bring him higher than this platform,
which might well be called part of Mars’ Hill. But
if they choose to bring him to the top, there was no
hindrance, for the venerable court held its sittings
in the open air, on stone seats; and when not thus
occupied the top of the rock may well have been a
convenient place of retirement for people who did
not want to be disturbed by new acquaintances and
the constant eddies of new gossip in the market-place.

It is, however, of far less import to know on what
spot of the Areopagus Paul stood, than to understand
clearly what he said, and how he sought to
conciliate as well as to refute the philosophers who,
no doubt, looked down upon him as an intellectual
<pb n='143'/><anchor id='Pg143'/>inferior. He starts naturally enough from the extraordinary
crowd of votive statues and offerings, for
which Athens was remarkable above all other cities
of Greece. He says, with a touch of irony, that
he finds them very religious indeed,<note place="foot">The fact that the title of Menander’s famous play was
<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">Δεισιδαίμων</foreign> has escaped the commentators. S. Paul must have
meant <q>rather superstitious,</q> as the A. V. has it.</note> so religious that
he even found an altar to a God professedly <hi rend='italic'>unknown</hi>,
or perhaps unknowable.<note place="foot">Though <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἄγνωστος</foreign> may surely have this meaning, I do not
find it suggested in any of the commentaries on the passage. They
all suppose some superstitious precaution, or else some case of the
real inscription being effaced by time, and supplied in this way.
The expression in Pausanias—the gods called unknown,
<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">τοῖς ὀνομαζομένοις ἀγνώστοις</foreign>—seems to suggest it as a regular title, and
we know that there were deities whose name was secret, and might
not be pronounced. But in the face of so many better critics I
will not insist upon this interpretation.</note> Probably S. Paul meant to
pass from the latter sense of the word <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἄγνωστος</foreign>,
which was, I fancy, what the inscription meant, to
the former, which gave him an excellent introduction
to his argument. Even the use of the singular
may have been an intentional variation from the
strict text, for Pausanias twice over speaks of altars
to the gods who are called the <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἄγνωστοι</foreign> (or mysterious),
but I cannot find any citation of the inscription
in the singular form. However that may be,
our version does not preserve the neatness of S.
Paul’s point: <q>I find an altar,</q> he says, <q>to an unknown
God. Whom then ye unknowingly worship,
<pb n='144'/><anchor id='Pg144'/>Him I announce to you.</q> But then he develops a
conception of the great One God, not at all from
the special Jewish, but from the Stoic point of view.
He was preaching to Epicureans and to Stoics—to
the advocates of prudence as the means, and pleasure
as the end, of a happy life, on the one hand;
on the other, to the advocates of duty, and of life in
harmony with the Providence which governs the
world for good. There could be no doubt to which
side the man of Tarsus must incline. Though the
Stoics of the market-place of Athens might be mere
dilettanti, mere talkers about the <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἀγαθόν</foreign> and the great
soul of the world, we know that this system of philosophy
produced at Tarsus as well as at Rome the
most splendid constancy, the most heroic endurance—I
had almost said the most Christian benevolence.
It was this stern and earnest theory which attracted
all serious minds in the decay of heathenism.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, S. Paul makes no secret of his
sympathy with its nobler features. He describes
the God whom he preaches as the benevolent Author
of the beauty and fruitfulness of Nature, the great
Benefactor of mankind by His providence, and not
without constant and obtrusive witnesses of His
greatness and His goodness. But he goes much
further, and treads close upon the Stoic pantheism
when he not only asserts, in the words of Aratus,
<anchor id="corr144"/><corr sic="than">that</corr> we are His offspring, but that <q>in Him we live,
and move, and have our being.</q>
</p>

<pb n='145'/><anchor id='Pg145'/>

<p>
His first conclusion, that the Godhead should not
be worshipped or even imaged in stone or in bronze,
was no doubt quite in accordance with more enlightened
Athenian philosophy. But it was when he
proceeded to preach the Resurrection of the Dead,
that even those who were attracted by him, and
sympathized with him, turned away in contempt.
The Epicureans thought death the end of all things.
The Stoics thought that the human soul, the offspring—nay,
rather an offshoot—of the Divine
world-soul, would be absorbed into its parent
essence. Neither could believe the assertion of
S. Paul. When they first heard him talk of <hi rend='italic'>Jesus</hi>
and <hi rend='italic'>Anastasis</hi> they thought them some new pair of
Oriental deities. But when they learned that Jesus
was a man ordained by God to judge the world, and
that Anastasis was merely the Anastasis of the dead,
they were greatly disappointed; so some mocked,
and some excused themselves from further listening.
</p>

<p>
Thus ended, to all appearance ignominiously, the
first heralding of the faith which was to supplant all
the temples and altars and statues with which Athens
had earned its renown as a beautiful city, which was
to overthrow the schools of the sneering philosophers,
and even to remodel all the society and the policy
of the world. And yet, in spite of this great and
decisive triumph of Christianity there was something
curiously prophetic in the contemptuous rejection
of its apostle at Athens. Was it not the
<pb n='146'/><anchor id='Pg146'/>first expression of the feeling which still possesses
the visitor who wanders through its ruins, and which
still dominates the educated world?—the feeling that
while other cities owe to the triumph of Christianity
all their beauty and their interest, Athens has to this
day resisted this influence; and that while the
Christian monuments of Athens would elsewhere
excite no small attention, here they are passed by
as of no import compared with its heathen splendor.<note place="foot"><p>This depends on no mere accident, but on the essential features
of the spiritual side of Greek character, on which I will quote
an admirable passage from Renan’s <hi rend='italic'>S. Paul</hi>:</p>
    <p><q rend="post: none">Ce qui caractérisait la religion du Grec autrefois, ce qui la
caractérise encore de nos jours, c’est le manque d’infini, de vague,
d’attendrissement, de mollesse féminine; la profondeur du sentiment
religieux allemand et celtique manque à la race des vrais
Hellènes. La piété du Grec orthodoxe consiste en pratiques et en
signes extérieurs. Les églises orthodoxes, parfois très-élégantes,
n’ont rien des terreurs qu’on ressent dans une église gothique.
En ce christianisme oriental, point de larmes, de prières, de componction
intérieure. Les enterrements y sont presque gais; ils ont
lieu le soir, au soleil couchant, quand les ombres sont déjà longues,
avec des chants à mi-voix et un déploiement de couleurs voyantes.
La gravité fanatique des Latins déplaît à ces races vives, sereines,
légères. L’infirme n’y est pas abattu: il voit doucement venir la
mort; tout sourit autour de lui. Là est le secret de cette gaieté
divine des poëmes homériques et de Platon: le récit de la mort de
Socrate dans le <hi rend='italic'>Phédon</hi> montre à peine une teinte de tristesse. La
vie, c’est donner sa fleur, puis son fruit; quoi de plus? Si, comme
on peut le soutenir, la préoccupation de la mort est le trait le plus
important du christianisme et du sentiment religieux moderne, la
race grecque est la moins religieuse des races. C’est une race
superficielle, prenant la vie comme une chose sans surnaturel ni
arrière-plan. Une telle simplicité de conception tient en grande
partie au climat, à la pureté de l’air, à l’étonnante joie qu’on
respire, mais bien plus encore aux instincts de la race hellénique,
adorablement idéaliste. Un rien, un arbre, une fleur, un lézard,
une tortue, provoquant le souvenir de mille métamorphoses chantées
par les poëtes; un filet d’eau, un petit creux dans le rocher, qu’on
qualifie d’antre des nymphes; un puits avec une tasse sur la margelle,
un pertuis de mer si étroit que les papillons le traversent et
pourtant navigable aux plus grands vaisseaux, comme à Poros;
des orangers, des cyprès dont l’ombre s’étend sur la mer, un petit
bois de pins au milieu des rochers, suffisent en Grèce pour produire
le contentement qu’éveille la beauté. Se promener dans les jardins
pendant la nuit, écouter les cigales, s’asseoir au clair de lune en
jouant de la flûte; aller boire de l’eau dans la montagne, apporter
avec soi un petit pain, un poisson et un lécythe de vin qu’on boit
en chantant; aux fêtes de famille, suspendre une couronne de
feuillage au-dessus de sa porte, aller avec des chapeaux de fleurs;
les jours de fêtes publiques, porter des thyrses garnis de
        <anchor id="corr147"/><corr sic="fueillages">feuillages</corr>;
passer des journées à danser, à jouer avec des chèvres apprivoisées—voilà
les plaisirs grecs, plaisirs d’une race pauvre, économe,
éternellement jeune, habitant un pays charmant, trouvant son bien
en elle-même et dans les dons que les dieux lui ont faits. La
pastorale à la façon de Théocrite fut dans les pays helléniques une
vérité; la Grèce se plut toujours à ce petit genre de poésie fin et
aimable, l’un des plus <anchor id="corr147a"/><corr sic="caractèristiques">caractéristiques</corr> de sa littérature, miroir de
sa propre vie, presque partout ailleurs niais et factice. La belle
humeur, la joie de vivre sont les choses grecques par excellence.
Cette race a toujours vingt ans: pour elle, <hi rend='italic'>indulgere genio</hi> n’est pas
la pesante ivresse de l’Anglais, le grossier ébattement du Français;
c’est tout simplement penser que la nature est bonne, qu’on peut
et qu’on doit y céder. Pour le Grec, en effet, la nature est une
conseillère d’élégance, une maîtresse de droiture et de vertu; la
<q>concupiscence,</q> cette idée que la nature nous induit à mal faire,
est un non-sens pour lui. Le goût de la parure qui distingue le
palicare, et qui se montre avec tant d’innocence dans la jeune
Grecque, n’est pas la pompeuse vanité du barbare, la sotte prétention
de la bourgeoise, bouffie de son ridicule orgueil de parvenue;
c’est le sentiment pur et fin de naïfs jouvenceaux, se sentant fils
légitimes des vrais inventeurs de la beauté.</q></p>
    <p><q rend="post: none">Une telle race, on le comprend, eût accueilli Jésus par un
sourire. Il était une chose que ces enfants exquis ne pouvaient
nous apprendre: le sérieux profond, l’honnêteté simple, le dévouement
sans gloire, la bonté sans emphase. Socrate est un moraliste
de premier ordre: mais il n’a rien à faire dans l’histoire religieuse.
Le Grec nous paraît toujours un peu sec et sans cœur: il a de
l’esprit, du mouvement, de la subtilité; il n’a rien de rêveur, de
mélancolique. Nous autres, Celtes et Germains, la source de notre
génie, c’est notre cœur. Au fond de nous est comme une fontaine de
fées, une fontaine claire, verte et profonde, où se reflète l’infini.
Chez le Grec, l’amour propre, la vanité se mêlent à tout; le sentiment
vague lui est inconnu; la réflexion sur sa propre destinée lui paraît
fade. Poussée à la caricature, une façon si incomplète d’entendre
la vie donne a l’époque romaine le <hi rend='italic'>græculus esuriens</hi>, grammairien,
artiste, charlatan, acrobate, médecin, amuseur du monde entier, fort
analogue à l’Italien des XVI<hi rend="vertical-align: super; font-size: small">e</hi> et
    XVII<hi rend="vertical-align: super; font-size: small">e</hi> siècles: à l’époque byzantine,
le théologien sophiste faisant dégénérer la religion en subtiles disputes;
de nos jours, le Grec moderne, quelquefois vaniteux et
ingrat, le <hi rend='italic'>papas</hi> orthodoxe, avec sa religion égoïste et matérielle.
Malheur à qui s’arrête à cette décadence! Honte à celui qui,
devant le Parthénon, songe à remarquer un ridicule! Il faut le
reconnaître pourtant: la Grèce ne fut jamais sérieusement chrétienne;
elle ne l’est pas encore. Aucune race ne fut moins
romantique, plus dénuée du sentiment chevaleresque de notre
moyen âge. Platon bâtit toute sa théorie de la beauté en se passant
de la femme. Penser à une femme pour s’exciter à faire de grandes
choses! un Grec eût été bien surpris d’un pareil langage; il pensait, lui, aux hommes réunis sur l’<hi rend='italic'>agora</hi>, il pensait à la patrie.
Sous ce rapport, les Latins étaient plus près de nous. La poésie
grecque, incomparable dans les grands genres tels que l’épopée, la
tragédie, la poésie lyrique désintéressée, n’avait pas, ce semble, la
douce note élégiaque de Tibulle, de Virgile, de Lucrèce, note si
bien en harmonie avec nos sentiments, si voisine de ce que nous
aimons.</q></p>
    <p><q>La même différence se retrouve entre la piété de saint Bernard,
de saint François d’Assise et celle des saints de l’Église
grecque. Ces belles écoles de Cappadoce, de Syrie, d’Égypte, des
Pères du désert, sont presque des écoles philosophiques. L’hagiographie
populaire des Grecs est plus mythologique que celle des
Latins. La plupart des saints qui figurent dans l’iconostase d’une
maison grecque et devant lesquels brûle une lampe ne sont pas
de grands fondateurs, de grands hommes, comme les saints de
l’Occident; ce sont souvent des êtres fantastiques, d’anciens
dieux transfigurés, ou du moins des combinaisons de personnages
historiques et de mythologie, comme saint Georges. Et cette
admirable église de Sainte-Sophie! c’est un temple arien; le genre
humain tout entier pourrait y faire sa prière. N’ayant pas eu de
pape, d’inquisition, de scolastique, de moyen age barbare, ayant
toujours gardé un levain d’arianisme, la Grèce lâchera plus facilement
qu’aucun autre pays le christianisme surnaturel, à peu près
comme ces Athéniens d’autrefois étaient en même temps, grâce à
une sorte de légèreté, mille fois plus profonde que le sérieux de nos
lourdes races, le plus superstitieux des peuples et le plus voisin du
rationalisme. Les chants populaires grecs sont encore aujourd’hui
pleins d’images et d’idées païennes. À la grande différence de
l’Occident, l’Orient garda durant tout le moyen âge et jusqu’aux
temps modernes de vrais <q>hellénistes,</q> au fond plus païens que
chrétiens, vivants du culte de la vieille patrie grecque et des vieux
auteurs. Ces hellénistes sont, au XV<hi rend="vertical-align: super; font-size: small">e</hi> siècle, les agents de la renaissance
de l’Occident, auquel ils apportent les textes grecs, base de
toute civilization. Le même esprit a présidé et présidera aux destinées
de la Grèce nouvelle. Quand on a bien étudié ce qui fait de
nos jours le fond d’un Hellène cultivé, on voit qu’il y a chez lui
très-peu de christianisme: il est chrétien de forme, comme un
Persan est musulman; mais au fond il est <q>helléniste.</q> Sa religion,
c’est l’adoration de l’ancien génie grec. Il pardonne toute hérésie
au philhellène, a celui qui admire son passé; il est bien moins
disciple de Jésus et de saint Paul que de Plutarque et de Julien.</q></p></note>
<pb n='147'/><anchor id='Pg147'/>There are very old and very beautiful little churches
in Athens, <q>ces délicieuses petites églises byzantines,</q>
<pb n='148'/><anchor id='Pg148'/>as M. Renan calls them. They are very peculiar,
and unlike what one generally sees in Europe.
<pb n='149'/><anchor id='Pg149'/>They strike the observer with their quaintness and

<pb n='150'/><anchor id='Pg150'/>of that unique and splendid building, the cathedral

little we notice them at Athens. I was even told—I
sincerely hope it was false—that public opinion at
Athens was gravitating toward the total removal of
one, and that the most perfect, of these churches,
which stands in the middle of a main street, and so
breaks the regularity of the modern boulevard! Let
us hope that the man who lashes himself into rage at
the destruction of the Venetian tower may set his
face in time against this real piece of barbarism, if
indeed it ever ventures to assert itself in act.<note place="foot">The reader will find in my last chapter some further information

<p>
I have now concluded a review of the most
important old Greek buildings to be seen about
Athens. To treat them exhaustively would require
a far longer discussion, or special knowledge which
I do not possess; and there are, moreover, smaller
buildings, like the so-called Lantern of Demosthenes,
which is really the Choragic monument of Lysicrates,
and the Temple of the Winds, which are well worth
<pb n='151'/><anchor id='Pg151'/>a visit, but which the traveller can find without a
guide, and study without difficulty. But incompleteness
must be an unavoidable defect in describing
any city in which new discoveries are being
made, I may say, monthly, and when the museums
and excavations of to-day may be any day completely
eclipsed by materials now unknown, or
scattered through the country. Thus, on my second
visit to Athens, I found in the National Bank the
wonderful treasures exhumed by Dr. Schliemann at
Mycenæ, which are in themselves enough to induce
any student of Greek antiquity to revisit the town,
however well he may have examined it in former
years. On my third visit, they were arranged and
catalogued, but we have not yet attained to any certainty
about the race that left them there, and how
remote the antiquity of the tombs. These considerations
tend not only to vindicate the inadequateness
of this review, but perhaps even to justify it in the
eyes of the exacting reader, who may have expected
a more thorough survey.

There are two modern towns which, in natural
features, resemble Athens. The irregular ridge of
greater Acropolis and lesser Areopagus remind one
of the castle and the Mönchsberg of Salzburg, one
of the few towns in Europe more beautifully situated
than Athens. The relation of the Acropolis to the
more lofty Lycabettus suggests the castle of Edinburgh
and Arthur’s Seat. But here the advantage
is greatly on the side of Athens.
</p>

<p>
When you stand on the Acropolis and look round
upon Attica, a great part of its history becomes immediately
unravelled and clear. You see at once
that you are placed in the principal plain of the
country, surrounded with chains of mountains in
such a way that it is easy to understand the old
stories of wars with Eleusis, or with Marathon, or
with any of the outlying valleys. Looking inland
on the north side, as you stand beside the Erechtheum,
you see straight before you, at a distance of
some ten miles, Mount Pentelicus, from which all
the splendid marble was once carried to the rock
<pb n='153'/><anchor id='Pg153'/>around you. This Pentelicus is a sort of intermediate
cross-chain between two main lines which diverge
from either side of it, and gradually widen so
as to form the plain of Athens. The left or north-western
chain is Mount Parnes; the right or eastern
is Mount Hymettus. This latter, however, is only
the inner margin of a large mountainous tract which
spreads all over the rest of South Attica down to
the Cape of Sunium. There are, of course, little
valleys, and two or three villages, one of them the
old deme Brauron, which they now pronounce Vravron.
There is the town of Thorikos, near the
mines of Laurium; there are two modern villages
called Marcopoulos; but on the whole, both in ancient
and modern times, this south-eastern part of
Attica, south of Hymettus, was, with the exception
of Laurium, of little moment. There is a gap
between Pentelicus and Hymettus, nearly due north,
through which the way leads out to Marathon; and
you can see the spot where the bandits surprised
in 1870 the unfortunate gentlemen who fell victims
to the vacillation and incompetence of people in
power at that time.
</p>

<p>
On the left side of Pentelicus you see the chain
of Parnes, which almost closes with it at a far distance,
and which stretches down all the north-west
side of Attica till it runs into the sea as Mount
Corydallus, opposite to the island of Salamis. In
this long chain of Parnes (which can only be
<pb n='154'/><anchor id='Pg154'/>avoided by going up to the northern coast at Oropus,
and passing into Bœotia close by the sea) there are
three passes or lower points, one far to the north—that
by Dekelea, where the present king has his
country palace, but where of old Alcibiades planted
the Spartan garrison which tormented and ruined
the farmers of Attica. This pass leads you out
to Tanagra in Bœotia. Next to the south, some
miles nearer, is the even more famous pass of Phyle,
from which Thrasybulus and his brave fellows recovered
Athens and its liberty. This pass, when
you reach its summit, looks into the northern point
of the Thriasian plain, and also into the wilder
regions of Cithæron, which border Bœotia. The
third pass, and the lowest—but a few miles beyond
the groves of Academe—is the pass of Daphne,
which was the high road to Eleusis, along which the
sacred processions passed in the times of the Mysteries;
and in this pass you still see the numerous
niches in which native tablets had been set by the
worshippers at a famous temple of Aphrodite.
</p>

<p>
On this side of Attica also, with the exception of
the Thriasian plain and of Eleusis, there extends
outside Mount Parnes a wild mountainous district,
quite alpine in character, which severs Attica from
Bœotia, not by a single row of mountains, or by a
single pass, but by a succession of glens and defiles
which at once explain to the classical student, when
he sees them, how necessary and fundamental were
<pb n='155'/><anchor id='Pg155'/>the divisions of Greece into its separate districts,
and how completely different in character the inhabitants
of each were sure to be. The way from
Attica into Bœotia was no ordinary high road, nor
even a pass over one mountain, but through a series
of glens and valleys and defiles, at any of which a
hostile army could be stopped, and each of which
severed the country on either side by a difficult obstacle.
This truly alpine nature of Greece is only
felt when we see it, and yet must ever be kept before
the mind in estimating the character and energy of
the race. But let us return to our view from the
Acropolis.
</p>

<p>
If we turn and look southward, we see a broken
country, with several low hills between us and the
sea—hills tolerably well cultivated, and when I saw
them in May all colored with golden stubbles, for
the corn had just been reaped. But all the plain in
every direction seems dry and dusty; arid, too, and
not rich alluvial soil, like the plains of Bœotia. Then
Thucydides’s words come back to us, when he says
Attica was <q>undisturbed on account of the lightness
of its soil</q> (<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἀστασίαστος οὖσα διὰ τὸ λεπτόγεων</foreign>), as
early invaders rather looked out for richer pastures.
This reflection, too, of Thucydides applies equally
to the mountains of Attica round Athens, which are
not covered with rich grass and dense shrubs, like
Helicon, like Parnassus, like the glades of Arcadia,
but seem so bare that we wonder where the bees of
<pb n='156'/><anchor id='Pg156'/>Hymettus can find food for their famous honey. It
is only when the traveller ascends the rocky slopes
of the mountain that he finds its rugged surface
carpeted with quantities of little wild flowers, too
insignificant to give the slightest color to the mountain,
but sufficient for the bees, which are still making
their honey as of old. This honey of Hymettus,
which was our daily food at Athens, is now not very
remarkable either for color or flavor. It is very
dark, and not by any means so good as the honey
produced in other parts of Greece—not to say
on the heather hills of Scotland and Ireland. I
tasted honey at Thebes and at Corinth which was
much better, especially that of Corinth made in the
hills toward Cleonæ, where the whole country is
scented with thyme, and where thousands of bees
are buzzing eagerly through the summer air. But
when the old Athenians are found talking so much
about honey, we must not forget that sugar was
unknown to them, and that all their sweetmeats
depended upon honey exclusively. Hence the
culture and use of it assumed an importance not
easily understood among moderns, who are in possession
of the sugar-cane.
</p>

<p>
But amid all the dusty and bare features of the
view, the eye fastens with delight on one great broad
band of dark green, which, starting from the west
side of Pentelicus, close to Mount Parnes in the
north, sweeps straight down the valley, passing about
<pb n='157'/><anchor id='Pg157'/>two miles to the west of Athens, and reaching to the
Peiræus. This is the plain of the Kephissus, and
these are the famous olive woods which contain with
them the deme Colonus, so celebrated by Sophocles,
and the groves of Academe, at their nearest point to
the city. The dust of Athens, and the bareness of
the plain, make all walks about the town disagreeable,
save either the ascent of Lycabettus, or a
ramble into these olive woods. The River Kephissus,
which waters them, is a respectable, though
narrow river, even in summer often discharging a
good deal of water, but much divided into trenches
and arms, which are very convenient for irrigation.<note place="foot">I have seen it very full in June; I have also seen it almost
dry in April, so that it depends upon the season whether the
traveller will enjoy the coolness of the river, or turn with disappointment
from its stony bed.</note>
So there is a strip of country, fully ten miles long,
and perhaps two wide on the average, which affords
delicious shade and greenness and the song of birds,
instead of hot sunlight and dust and the shrill clamor
of the tettix without.
</p>

<p>
I have wandered many hours in these delightful
woods listening to the nightingales, which sing all
day in the deep shade and solitude, as it were in a
prolonged twilight, and hearing the plane-tree
whispering to the elm,<note place="foot">On a fine summer’s day, in the meadows about Eton, I was
struck with the truth of this phrase. A light breeze was making
all the poplars shiver beside the great elms, which stood in silence.</note> as Aristophanes has it, and
<pb n='158'/><anchor id='Pg158'/>seeing the white poplar show its silvery leaves in the
breeze, and wondering whether the huge old olive
stems, so like the old pollarded stumps in Windsor
Forest, could be the actual sacred trees, the <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">μορίαι</foreign>,
under which the youth of Athens ran their races.
The banks of the Kephissus, too, are lined with
great reeds, and sedgy marsh plants, which stoop
over into its sandy shallows and wave idly in the
current of its stream. The ouzel and the kingfisher
start from under one’s feet, and bright fish move out
lazily from their sunny bay into the deeper pool.
Now and then through a vista the Acropolis shows
itself in a framework of green foliage, nor do I know
any more enchanting view of that great ruin.
</p>

<p>
All the ground under the dense olive-trees was
covered with standing corn, for here, as in Southern
Italy, the shade of trees seems no hindrance to the
ripening of the ear. But there was here thicker
wood than in Italian corn-fields; on the other hand,
there was not that rich festooning of vines which
spread from tree to tree, and which give a Neapolitan
summer landscape so peculiar a charm. A few
homesteads there were along the roads, and even at
one of the bridges a children’s school, full of those
beautiful fair children whose heads remind one so
strongly of the old Greek statues. But all the
houses were walled in, and many of them seemed
solitary and deserted. The memories of rapine and
violence were still there. I was told, indeed, that
<pb n='159'/><anchor id='Pg159'/>no country in Europe was so secure, and I confess
I found it so myself in my wanderings; but when
we see how every disturbance or war on the frontier
revives again the rumor of brigandage, I
could not help feeling that the desert state of the
land, and the general sense of insecurity, however
irrational in the intervals of peace, was not surprising.
</p>

<p>
There is no other excursion in the immediate
vicinity of Athens of any like beauty or interest.
The older buildings in the Peiræus are completely
gone. No trace of the docks or the <hi rend='italic'>deigma</hi> remains;
and the splendid walls, built as Thucydides tells us
with cut stone, without mortar or mud, and fastened
with clamps of iron fixed with lead—this splendid
structure has been almost completely destroyed.
We can find, indeed, elsewhere in Attica—at Phyle—still
better at Eleutheræ—specimens of this sort of
building, but at the Peiræus there are only foundations
remaining. Yet it is not really true that the
great wall surrounding the Peiræus has totally disappeared.
Even at the mouth of the harbor single
stones may be seen lying along the rocky edge of
the water, of which the size and the square cutting
prove the use for which they were originally intended.
But if the visitor to the Peiræus will take
the trouble to cross the hill, and walk round the
harbor of Munychia, he will find on the eastern
point of the headland a neat little café, with
com<pb n='160'/><anchor id='Pg160'/>fortable seats, and with a beautiful view. The sea
coast all round this headland shows the bed of the
surrounding sea wall, hewn in the live rock. The
actual structure is preserved in patches on the western
point of this harbor, where the coast is very
steep; but in the place to which I refer, we can
trace the whole course of the wall a few feet above
the water, cut out in the solid rock. I know no
scanty specimen of Athenian work which gives a
greater idea of the enormous wealth and energy of
the city. The port of Munychia had its own theatre
and temples, and it was here that Pausanias saw the
altar to <hi rend='italic'>the gods called the unknown</hi>. The traces of
the sea wall cease as soon as it reaches the actual
narrow mouth of the little harbor. I do not know
how far toward Phalerum it can be traced, but
when visiting the harbor called Zea<note place="foot">This was the military harbor, at least in the fourth century,
<hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>, when the architect Philo built a famous arsenal (<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">σκευοθήκη</foreign>)
at its north-east corner, of which the plan and even details have
been reconstructed by Dr. Dörpfeld from an important inscription
recovered in 1881.</note> on another
occasion, I did not observe it. The reader will find
in any ancient atlas, or in any history of Greece, a
map of the harbors of Athens, so that I think it
unnecessary to append one here.
</p>

<p>
The striking feature in the present Peiræus, which
from the entrance of the harbor is very picturesque,
is undoubtedly the rapid growth and extension of
<pb n='161'/><anchor id='Pg161'/>factories, with English machinery and overseers.
When last there I found fourteen of these establishments,
and their chimneys were becoming quite a
normal feature in Greek landscape. Those which I
visited were working up the cotton and the wool of
the country into calico and other stuffs, which are
unfortunately coming into fashion among the lower
classes, and ousting the old costume. I was informed
that boys were actually forbidden to attend
school in Greek dress, a regulation which astonishes
any one who knows the beauty and dignity of the
national costume.

<p>
A drive to the open roadstead of Phalerum is more
repaying. Here it is interesting to observe how the
Athenians passed by the nearest sea, and even an
open and clear roadstead, in order to join their city
to the better harbor and more defensible headland of
Peiræus. Phalĕrum, as they now call it, though
they spell it with an <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">η</foreign>, is the favorite bathing-place
of modern Athens, with an open-air theatre, and is
about a mile and a half nearer the city than Peiræus.
The water is shallow, and the beach is of fine sand,
so that for ancient ships, which I suppose drew little
water, it was a convenient landing-place, especially
for the disembarking of troops, who could choose
their place anywhere around a large crescent, and
actually land fighting, if necessary. But the walls
of Athens, the long walls to Peiræus, and its lofty
fortifications, made this roadstead of no use to the
<pb n='162'/><anchor id='Pg162'/>enemy so long as Athens held the command of
the sea, and could send out ships from the secure
little harbors of Zea and Munychia, which are on
the east side and in the centre of the headland of
Peiræus. There was originally a third wall, too,
to the east side of the Phaleric bay, but this seems
to have been early abandoned when the second long
wall, or middle wall, as it was originally called, was
completed.
</p>

<p>
At the opening of the Peloponnesian war it
appears that the Athenians defended against the
Lacedæmonians, not the two long walls which ran
close together and parallel to Peiræus, but the northern
of these, and the far distant Phaleric wall. It
cannot but strike any observer as extraordinary how
the Athenians should undertake such an enormous
task. Had the enemy attacked anywhere suddenly
and with vigor, it seems hard to understand how
they could have kept him out. According to
Thucydides’s accurate detail,<note place="foot">Thucydides, followed by modern historians, has nevertheless
been inaccurate in his use of the expression <hi rend='italic'>Long Walls</hi>. He
sometimes means the north and Phaleric wall, sometimes the
north and south parallel walls, to the exclusion of the Phaleric
wall. The long walls rebuilt by Conon were the latter pair, and
thus not the same long walls as were finished in 456 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi></note> the wall to Phalerum
was nearly four miles, that to Peiræus four and a
half. There were in addition five miles of city wall,
and nearly three of Peiræus wall. That is to say,
there were about seventeen miles of wall to be
pro<pb n='163'/><anchor id='Pg163'/>tected. This is not all. The circuit was not closed,
but separated by about a mile of beach between
Peiræus and Phalerum, so that the defenders of the
two extremities could in no way promptly assist
each other. Thucydides tells us that a garrison of
16,000 inferior soldiers, old men, boys, and <hi rend='italic'>metics</hi>,
sufficed to do this work. We are forced to conclude
that not only were the means of attacking walls
curiously incomplete, but even the dash and enterprise
of modern warfare cannot have been understood
by the Greeks. For we never hear of even a
bold attempt on this absurdly straggling fortification,
far less of any successful attempt to force it.
</p>

<p>
But it is time that we should leave the environs
of Athens,<note place="foot">The reader who desires to see the best poetical picture of
modern Athens should consult the tenth chapter in Mr. Symonds’s
<hi rend='italic'>Sketches in Italy and Greece</hi>—one of the most beautiful productions
of that charming poet in prose.</note> and wander out beyond the borders of
the Athenian plain into the wilder outlying parts
of the land. Attica is, after all, a large country,
if one does not apply railway measures to it. We
think thirty miles by rail very little, but thirty
miles by road is a long distance, and implies
land enough to support a large population and to
maintain many flourishing towns. We can wander
thirty miles from Athens through Attica in several
directions—to Eleutheræ, on the western Bœotian
frontier; to Oropus, on the north; and Sunium, on
<pb n='164'/><anchor id='Pg164'/>the south. Thus it is only when one endeavors to
know Attica minutely that one finds how much there
is to be seen, and how long a time is required to see
it. And fortunately enough there is an expedition,
and that not the least important, where we can avoid
the rough paths and rougher saddles of the country,
and coast in a steamer along a district at all times
obscure in history, and seldom known for anything
except for being the road to Sunium. Strabo gives
a list of the demes along this seaboard,<note place="foot">IX. § I. p. 244 (Tauchn.).</note> and seems
only able to write one fact about them—a line from
an old oracle in the days of the Persian war, which
prophesied that <q>the women of Colias will roast
their corn with oars,</q><note place="foot">He reads, however,
    <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">φρίξουσι</foreign>, instead of Herodotus’s
    <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">φρύξουσι</foreign>.</note> alluding to the wrecks driven
on shore here by the northwest wind from Salamis.
Even the numerous little islands along this coast
were in his day, as they now are, perfectly barren.
Yet with all its desolation it is exceedingly picturesque
and varied in outline.
</p>

<p>
We took ship in the little steamer<note place="foot">There is now a railway from Athens to the mines (1887).</note> belonging to
the Sunium Mining Company, who have built a
village called Ergasteria, between Thorikos and the
promontory, and who were obliging enough to allow
us to sail in the boat intended for their private
traffic. We left the Peiræus on one of those peculiarly
Greek mornings, with a blue sky and very
<pb n='165'/><anchor id='Pg165'/>bright sun, but with an east wind so strong and
clear, so <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">λαμπρός</foreign>, as the old Greeks would say, that
the sea was driven into long white crests, and the
fishing-boats were lying over under their sails.
These fresh and strong winds, which are constantly
blowing in Greece, save the people very much from
the bad effects of a very hot southern climate.
Even when the temperature is high the weather is
seldom sultry; and upon the sea, which intrudes
everywhere, one can always find a cool and refreshing
atmosphere. The Greeks seem not the least to
fear these high winds, which are generally steady
and seldom turn to squalls. The smallest boats are
to be seen scudding along on great journeys from
one island to another—often with a single occupant,
who sits holding the helm with one hand, and the
stern sheet with the other. All the ferry-boats in
the Peiræus are managed in this way, and you
may see their great sails, like sea-gulls’ wings, leaning
over in the gale, and the spray dashing from the
vessel’s prow. We met a few larger vessels coming
up from Syra, but on the whole the sea was well-nigh
as desert as the coast; so much so, that the
faithful dog, which was on board each of those boats,
thought it his serious duty to stand up on the taffrail
and bark at us as a strange and doubtful company.
</p>

<p>
So, after passing many natural harbors and spacious
bays, many rocky headlands and bluff islands—but
all desert and abandoned by track of man, we
<pb n='166'/><anchor id='Pg166'/>approached the famous cape, from which the white
pillars of the lofty old temple gleamed brilliantly
in the sun. They were the first and only white
marble pillars which I saw in Greece. Elsewhere,
dust and age, if not the hand of man, have colored
that splendid material with a dull golden hue; but
here the sea breeze, while eating away much of the
surface, has not soiled them with its fresh brine, and
so they still remain of the color which they had
when they were set up. We should fain conjecture
that here, at all events, the Greeks had not applied
the usual blue and red to decorate this marvellous
temple; that—for the delight and benefit of the
sailors, who hailed it from afar, as the first sign of
Attica—its brilliant white color was left to it, to
render it a brighter beacon and a clearer object in
twilight and in mist. I will not yet describe it, for
we paid it a special visit, and must speak of it in
greater detail; but even now, when we coasted
round the headland, and looked up to its shining
pillars standing far aloft into the sky, it struck us
with the most intense interest. It was easy, indeed,
to see how Byron’s poetic mind was here inspired
with some of his noblest lines.
</p>

<p>
When we turned from it seaward, we saw
stretched out in <hi rend='italic'>échelon</hi> that chain of Cyclades, which
are but a prolongation of the headland—Keos,
Kyphnos, Seriphos, Siphnos, and in the far distance,
Melos—Melos, the scene of Athens’s violence and
<pb n='167'/><anchor id='Pg167'/>cruelty, when she filled up, in the mind of the old
historian, the full measure of her iniquity. And as
we turned northward, the long island, or islet, of
Helena, which stretches along the point, like Hydra
off that of Argolis, could not hide from us the
mountain ranges of Eubœa, still touched here and
there with snow. A short run against the wind
brought us to the port of Ergasteria, marked very
strangely in the landscape by the smoke of its
chimneys—the port where the present produce of
the mines of Laurium is prepared and shipped for
Scotland.
</p>

<p>
Here, at last, we found ourselves again among
men; three thousand operatives, many of them with
families, make quite a busy town of Ergasteria.
And I could not but contrast their bold and independent
looks, rough and savage as they seemed,
with what must have been the appearance of the
droves of slaves who worked the mines in old days.
We were rowed ashore from our steamer by two men
called Aristides and Epaminondas, but I cannot say
that their looks betokened either the justice of the
one or the culture of the other.
</p>

<p>
We found ourselves when we landed in an awkward
predicament. The last English engineer remaining
in the Mining Company, at whose invitation
we had ventured into this wild district, had suddenly
left, that morning, for Athens. His house was shut
up, and we were left friendless and alone, among
<pb n='168'/><anchor id='Pg168'/>three thousand of these Aristideses and Epaminondases,
whose appearance was, as I have said, anything
but reassuring. We did what was best to meet the
difficulty, and what was not only the best thing to
do, but the only thing, and it turned out very well
indeed. We went to the temporary director of the
mines, a very polished gentleman, with a charming
wife, both of whom spoke French excellently. We
stated our case, and requested hospitality for the
night. Nothing could be more friendly than our
reception. This benevolent man and his wife took
us into their own house, prepared rooms for us, and
promised to let us see all the curiosities of the
country. Thus our misfortune became, in fact, a
very good fortune. The night, however, it must be
confessed, was spent in a very unequal conflict with
mosquitoes—an inconvenience which our good hostess
in vain endeavored to obviate by giving us a
strong-smelling powder to burn in our room, and
shutting all the windows. But had the remedy been
even successful, it is very doubtful whether it was
not worse than the disease.
</p>

<p>
We started in the morning by a special train—for
the company have a private line from the coast up
to the mines—to ascend the wooded and hilly
country into the region so celebrated of old as one
of the main sources of Athenian wealth. As the
train wound its way round the somewhat steep
ascent, our prospect over the sea and its islands
<pb n='169'/><anchor id='Pg169'/>became larger and more varied. The wild rocks and
forests of southern Eubœa—one of the few districts
in Greece which seem to have been as savage and
deserted in old days as they are now—detached
themselves from the intervening island of Helena.
We were told that wild boars were still to be found
in Eubœa. In the hills about Laurium, hares, which
Xenophon so loved to hunt in his Elean retreat, and
turtle doves, seemed the only game attainable. All
the hills were covered with stunted underwood.

</else></pgIf>
<p>
The mines of Laurium appear very suddenly in
Attic history, but from that time onward are a
prominent part of the wealth of the Athenians.
We know that in Solon’s day there was great
scarcity of money, and that he was obliged to depreciate
the value of the coinage—a very violent
and unprecedented measure, never repeated; for, all
through later history, Attic silver was so good that
it circulated at a premium in foreign parts just as
English money does now. Accordingly, in Solon’s
time we hear no mention of this great and almost
inexhaustible source of national wealth. All through
the reign of the Peisistratids there is a like silence.
Suddenly, after the liberation of Athens, we hear of
Themistocles persuading the people to apply the
very large revenue from these mines to the building
of a fleet for the purpose of the war with Ægina.<note place="foot">The earliest allusion to them is a line in Æschylus’s <hi rend='italic'>Persæ</hi>,
where they come in so peculiarly, and without any natural
suggestion, that they must have been in his day a new and surprising
source of wealth. Atossa is inquiring of the chorus about Athens,
and whether it possesses any considerable wealth. The chorus
replies (v. 238):

<lg>
<l><foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἀργύρου πηγή τις αὐτοῖς ἐστι, θησαυρὸς χθονός.</foreign></l>
</lg>

This inference of mine, made years ago, is now strongly confirmed
by the recovered <hi rend='italic'>Polity of the Athenians</hi>, which says (chap. xxii.):
<q>In the archonship of Nicodemus [484–3 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>], when the mines
at Maroneia [as he calls them] were discovered (<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἐφάνη</foreign>), and there
was a profit of 100 talents from the work, Themistocles,</q> etc.</note>
<pb n='170'/><anchor id='Pg170'/>The so-called Xenophon <hi rend='italic'>On the Attic Revenues</hi>—a
tract which is almost altogether about these mines—asserts
indeed that they had been worked from
remote antiquity; and there can be little doubt that
here, as elsewhere in Greece, the Phœnicians had
been the forerunners of the natives in the art of
mining. Here, as in Thasos, I believe the Phœnicians
had their settlements; and possibly a closer
survey of the great underground passages, which
are still there, may give us some proof by inscriptions
or otherwise.
</p>

<p>
But what happened after the Semitic traders had
been expelled from Greek waters?—for expelled
they were, though, perhaps, far later from some
remote and unexplored points than we usually
imagine. I suppose that when this took place
Athens was by no means in a condition to think
about prosecuting trade at Sunium. Salamis, which
was far closer and a more obvious possession, was
only conquered in Solon’s day, after a long and
<pb n='171'/><anchor id='Pg171'/>tedious struggle; and I am perfectly certain that
the Athenians could have had no power to hold an
outlying dependency, separated by thirty miles of
the roughest mountain country, when they had not
subdued an island scarcely a mile from the Thriasian
plain and not ten miles from Athens. I take it,
then, that the so-called <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">συνοικισμός</foreign>, or unifying of
Athens, in prehistoric times, by Theseus, or whoever
did it, was not a cementing of all Attica, including
these remote corners, but only of the settlements
about the plains of Attica, Marathon, and
Eleusis; and that the southern end of the peninsula
was not included in the Athens of early days. It was,
in fact, only accessible by a carefully constructed
artificial road, such as we hear of afterward, or by
sea. The Athenians had not either of these means
of access at so early a period. And it is not a little
remarkable that the first mention of their ownership
of the silver mines is associated with the building of
a fleet to contend with Ægina. I have no doubt
that Themistocles’s advice has been preserved without
his reasons for it. He persuaded the Athenians
to surrender their surplus revenue from Laurium, to
build ships against the Æginetans, simply because
they found that without ships the Æginetans would
be practically sole possessors of the mines. They
were far closer to Laurium by sea than Athens was
by land—closer, indeed, in every way—and I am
led to suspect that, in the days before Solon, the
<pb n='172'/><anchor id='Pg172'/>mines may have been secretly worked by Ægina,
and not by Athens. I cannot here enter into my
full reasons, but I fancy that Peisistratus and his
sons—not by conquest, but by some agreement—got
practical possession of the mines, and were, perhaps,
the first to make all Attica really subject to the
power of Athens.<note place="foot">It is possible that in the days of Eretria’s greatness, when she
ruled over a number of the Cyclades, Eretrians may have worked
the mines. These occupants probably preceded the Æginetans.
But the strange thing is, that the mines and their large profits
appear suddenly, and as a novelty, at a particular point of Greek
history.</note> But no sooner are they expelled
than the Æginetans renew their attacks or claims on
Laurium; and it is only the Athenian fleet which
secures to Athens its possession. We hear of proceedings
of Hippias about coinage,<note place="foot">Arist. <hi rend='italic'>Œcon.</hi>, <hi rend='small'>II.</hi> 4.</note> which are
adduced by Aristotle as specimens of injustice, or
sharp practice, and which may have something to
do with the acquisition of the silver mines by his
dynasty. But I must cut short this serious dissertation.
</p>

<p>
Our special train brought us up slowly round
wooded heights, and through rich green brakes, into
a lonely country, from which glimpses of the sea
could, however, still be seen, and glimpses of blue
islands, between the hills. And so we came to the
settlements of the modern miners. The great Company,
whose guests we were, had been started some
<pb n='173'/><anchor id='Pg173'/>years ago, by French and Italian speculators, and
Professor Anstead had been there as geologist for
some years. But the jealousy of the Greeks, when
they found out that profit was rewarding foreign
enterprise, caused legislation against the Company;
various complications followed, so that at last they
gladly sold their interest to a native Company. In
1887 this Company was still thriving; and I saw in
the harbor a large vessel from Glasgow, which had
come to carry the lead to Scotland, when prepared
in blocks—all the produce being still bought by a
single English firm.
</p>

<p>
When the Greeks discuss these negotiations about
the mines they put quite a different color on the
affair. They say that the French and Italians desired
to evade fair payment for the ground-rent of
the mines, trusting to the strength of their respective
governments, and the weakness of Greece. The
Company’s policy is described in Greece as an over-reaching,
unscrupulous attempt to make great profits
by sharp bargains with the natives, who did not know
the value of their property. A great number of
obscure details are adduced in favor of their arguments,
and it seemed to me that the Greeks were
really convinced of their truth. In such a matter
it would be unfair to decide without stating both
sides; and I am quite prepared to change my present
conviction that the Greeks were most to blame,
if proper reasons can be assigned. But the
legis<pb n='174'/><anchor id='Pg174'/>lative Acts passed in their Parliament look very
ugly indeed at first sight.
</p>

<p>
The principal Laurium Company<note place="foot">Since I visited the place there are actually five companies—two
Greek and three French—established to work the district.</note> never enter the
mines at all, but gather the great mass of scoriæ,
which the old Athenians threw out after smelting
with more imperfect furnaces and less heat than ours.
These scoriæ, which look like stone cinders, have
been so long there that some vegetation has at last
grown over them, and the traveller does not suspect
that all the soil around was raised and altered
by the hand of man. Owing to the power of steam,
and their railway, the present miners carry down
the scoriæ on trucks to the sea-coast, to Ergasteria,
and there smelt them. The old Athenians had their
furnaces in the middle of the mountains, where
many of them are still to be seen. They sought
chiefly for silver, whereas the modern Company
are chiefly in pursuit of lead, and obtain but little
silver from the scoriæ.
</p>

<p>
In many places you come upon the openings of the
old pits, which went far into the bowels of the mountains,
through miles of underground galleries and
passages. Our engine-driver—an intelligent Frenchman—stopped
the train to show us one of these
entrances, which went down almost straight, with
good steps still remaining, into the earth. He assured
us that the other extremity which was known,
<pb n='175'/><anchor id='Pg175'/>all the passage being open, was some two or three
miles distant, at a spot which he showed us from a
hill. Hearing that inscriptions were found in these
pits, and especially that the name of Nicias had been
discovered there, we were very anxious to descend
and inspect them. This was promised to us, for the
actual pits were in the hands of another Greek
Company, who were searching for new veins of
silver. But when we arrived at the spot the officers
of the Company were unwilling to let us into the
pits. The proper overseer was away—intentionally,
of course. There were no proper candles; there
were no means of obtaining admission: so we were
balked in our inquiry. But we went far enough into
the mouth of one of them to see that these pits were
on a colossal scale, well arched up; and, I suppose,
had we gone far enough, we should have found
the old supports, of which the Athenian law was so
careful.
</p>

<p>
The quantity of scoriæ thrown out, which seems
now perfectly inexhaustible, is in itself sufficient
evidence of the enormous scale on which the old
mining was carried on. Thus, we do not in the
least wonder at hearing that Nicias had one thousand
slaves working in the mines, and that the profits accruing
to the State from the fines and head-rents of
the mines were very large—on a moderate estimate,
£8000 a year of our money, which meant in those
days a great deal more.
</p>

<pb n='176'/><anchor id='Pg176'/>

<p>
The author of the tract on <q>Athenian Revenue</q>
says that the riches of the mines were absolutely
unbounded; that only a small part of the silver district
had been worked out, though the digging had
gone on from time immemorial; and that after innumerable
laborers had been employed the mines
always appeared equally rich, so that no limit need
be put on the employment of capital. Still he speaks
of opening a new shaft as a most risky speculation.
His general estimate appears, however, somewhat
exaggerated. The writer confesses that the number
of laborers was in his day diminishing, and the
majority of the proprietors were then beginners; so
that there must have been great interruption of work
during the Peloponnesian War. In the age of Philip
there were loud complaints that the speculations in
mining were unsuccessful; and for obtaining silver,
at all events, no reasonable prospect seems to have
been left. In the first century of our era, Strabo
(ix. i. 23) says that these once celebrated mines were
exhausted,<note place="foot">There is also a quotation in Strabo (iii. 3, § 9), from Demetrius
Phal., implying their activity in the third century <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi> Plutarch
(<hi rend='italic'>de defectu or.</hi> 43) speaks of them as having <hi rend='italic'>lately</hi> failed.</note> that new mining did not pay, and thus
people were smelting the poorer ore, and the scoriæ
from which the ancients had imperfectly separated
the metal. He adds that the main product of the
mining district was in his day honey, which was especially
known as smokeless (<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἀκάπνιστον</foreign>), on
ac<pb n='177'/><anchor id='Pg177'/>count of its good preparation. This in itself shows
that the mining had decayed, for now all the flowers
in the neighborhood of the smelting are killed by
the black fumes.
</p>

<p>
Our last mention of the place in olden times is
that of Pausanias (at the end of the second century
<hi rend='small'>A. D.</hi>), who speaks of Laurium, with the addition
that it had once been the seat of the Athenian silver
mines!
</p>

<p>
There is but one more point suggested by these
mines, which it is not well to pass over when we are
considering the working of them in ancient times.
Nothing is more poisonous than the smoke from lead-mines;
and for this reason the people at Ergasteria
have built a chimney more than a mile long to the
top of a neighboring hill, where the smoke escapes.
Even so, when the wind blows back the smoke, all
the vegetation about the village is at once blighted,
and there is no greater difficulty than to keep a
garden within two or three miles of this chimney.
As the Athenians did not take such precautions, we
are not surprised to hear from them frequent notices of
the unhealthiness of the district, for when there were
many furnaces, and the smoke was not drawn away
by high chimneys, we can hardly conceive life to
have been tolerable. What then must have been the
condition of the gangs of slaves which Nicias and
other respectable and pious Athenians kept in these
mines? Two or three allusions give us a hideous
<pb n='178'/><anchor id='Pg178'/>insight into this great social sore, which has not been
laid bare, because the wild district of Laurium, and
the deep mines under its surface, have concealed the
facts from the ordinary observer. Nicias, we are
told, let out one thousand slaves to Sosias the
Thracian, at an obolus a day each—the lessee
being bound to restore them to him the same <hi rend='italic'>in
number</hi>.
</p>

<p>
The meaning of this frightful contract is only too
plain. The yearly rent paid for each slave was
about half the full price paid for him in the market.
It follows that, if the slave lived for three years,
Nicias made a profit of 50 per cent. on his outlay.
No doubt, some part of this extraordinary bargain
must be explained by the great profits which an
experienced miner could make—a fact supported
by the tract on the Revenues, which cannot date
more than a generation later than the bargain of
Nicias. The lessee, too, was under the additional
risk of the slaves escaping in time of war, when
a hostile army might make a special invasion into
the mountain district for the purpose of inflicting
a blow on this important part of Athenian revenue.
In such cases, it may be presumed that desperate
attempts were made by the slaves to escape, for
although the Athenian slaves generally were the
best treated in Greece, and had many holidays, it
was very different with the gangs employed by the
Thracian taskmaster. We are told that they had
<pb n='179'/><anchor id='Pg179'/>three hundred and sixty working days in the year.
This, together with the poison of the atmosphere,
tells its tale plainly enough.
</p>

<p>
And yet Nicias, the capitalist who worked this
hideous trade, was the most pious and God-fearing
man at Athens. So high was his reputation for
integrity and religion, that the people insisted on
appointing him again and again to commands for
which he was wholly unfit; and when at last he
ruined the great Athenian army before Syracuse,
and lost his own life, by his extreme devoutness
and his faith in the threats and warnings of the
gods—even then the great sceptical historian, who
cared for none of these things, condones all his
blunders for the sake of his piety and his respectability.
</p>

<p>
Of course, however, an excursion to Laurium,
interesting as it might be, were absurd without
visiting the far more famous Sunium,—the promontory
which had already struck us so much on our
sea voyage round the point,—the temple which
Byron has again hallowed with his immortal verse,
and Turner with his hardly less immortal pencil.
So we hired horses on our return from the mines,
and set out on a very fine afternoon to ride down
some seven or eight miles from Ergasteria to the
famous promontory. Our route led over rolling
hills, covered with arbutus and stunted firs; along
valleys choked with deep, matted grass; by the
<pb n='180'/><anchor id='Pg180'/>side of the sea, upon the narrow ledge of broken
rocks. Nowhere was there a road, or a vestige of
human habitation, save where the telegraph wire
dipped into the sea, pointing the way to the distant
Syra. It was late in the day, and the sun was
getting low, so we urged our horses to a canter
wherever the ground would permit it. But neither
the heat nor the pace could conquer the indefatigable
esquire who attended us on foot to show us the way,
and hold the horses when we stopped. His speed
and endurance made me think of Phidippides and
his run to Sparta; nor, indeed, do any of the feats
recorded of the old Greeks, either in swimming
or running, appear incredible when we witness the
feats that are being performed almost every day
by modern muscle and endurance. At last, after
a delightful two hours’ roaming through the homely
solitude, we found ourselves at the foot of the last
hill, and over us the shining pillars of the ruined
temple stood out against the sky.
</p>

<p>
There can be no doubt that the temple of Neptune
on Mount Tænarum must have been quite as fine as
to position, but the earthquakes of Laconia have
made havoc of its treasures, while at Sunium,
though some of the drums in the shafts of the
pillars have been actually displaced several inches
from their fellows above and below, so that the perfect
fitting of the old Athenians has come to look
like the tottering work of a giant child with marble
<pb n='181'/><anchor id='Pg181'/>bricks,—in spite of this, thirteen pillars remain,<note place="foot">Byron, who loved this spot above all others, I think, in
Greece, speaks of sixteen as still standing in his day.</note>
a piece of architrave, and a huge platform of solid
blocks; above all, a site not desecrated by modern
habitations, where we can sit and think of the great
old days, and of the men who set up this noble
monument at the remotest corner of their land.
The Greeks told us that this temple, that at Ægina,
and the Parthenon, are placed exactly at the angles
of a great equilateral triangle, with each side about
twenty-five or thirty miles long. Our maps do not
verify this belief. The distance from Athens to
Sunium appears much longer than either of the
other lines, nor do we find in antiquity any hint
that such a principle was attended to, or that any
peculiar virtue was attached to it.
</p>

<p>
We found the platform nearly complete, built with
great square blocks of poros-stone, and in some
places very high, though in others scarcely raised
at all, according to the requirements of the ground.
Over it the temple was built, not with the huge
blocks which we see at Corinth and in the Parthenon,
but still of perfectly white marble, and with that beautifully
close fitting, without mortar, rubble, or cement,
which characterizes the best and most perfect epoch
of Greek architecture.<note place="foot">Dr. Dörpfeld has since shown that the marble temple at
Sunium was built on the site of an older temple, with a very
slight but distinct enlargement of the plan. The older temple
was of the ordinary poros-stone found on the site.</note> The stone, too, is the finest
<pb n='182'/><anchor id='Pg182'/>white marble, and, being exposed to no dust on its
lofty site, has alone of all temples kept its original
color—if, indeed, it was originally white, and not
enriched with divers colors. The earthquake, which
has displaced the stones in the middle of the pillars,
has tumbled over many large pieces, which can be
seen from above scattered all down the slope where
they have rolled. But enough still remains for us
to see the plan, and imagine the effect of the whole
structure. It is in the usual simple, grand, Doric
style, but lighter in proportions than the older Attic
temples; and, being meant for distant effect, was
probably not much decorated. Its very site gives
it all the ornament any building could possibly
require.
</p>

<p>
It was our good fortune to see it in a splendid sunset,
with the sea a sheet of molten gold, and all the
headlands and islands colored with hazy purple.
The mountains of Eubœa, with their promontory of
Geræstus, closed the view upon the north-east; but
far down into the Ægean reached island after island,
as it were striving to prolong a highway to the holy
Delos. The ancient Andros, Tenos, Myconos were
there, but the eye sought in vain for the home of
Apollo’s shrine—the smallest and yet the greatest of
the group. The parallel chain, reaching down from
Sunium itself, was confused into one mass, but
ex<pb n='183'/><anchor id='Pg183'/>posed to view the distant Melos. Then came a short
space of open sea, due south, which alone prevented
us from imagining ourselves on some fair and quiet
inland lake; and beyond to the south-west we saw
the point of Hydra, the only spot in all Hellas whose
recent fame exceeds the report of ancient days.
The mountains of Argolis lay behind Ægina, and
formed with their Arcadian neighbors a solid background,
till the eye wandered round to the Acropolis
of Corinth, hardly visible in the burning brightness
of the sun’s decline. And all this splendid expanse
of sea and mountain, and bay and cliff, seemed as
utterly deserted as the wildest western coast of Scotland
or Ireland. One or two little white sails, speeding
in his boat some lonely fisherman, made the
solitude, if possible, more speaking and more intense.
There are finer views, more extensive, and
perhaps even more varied, but none more exquisitely
interesting and more melancholy to the student of
Ancient Greece.

<p>
This great loneliness is a feature that strikes the
traveller almost everywhere through the country.
Many centuries of insecurity, and indeed of violence,
have made country life almost impossible; and now
that better times have come, the love and knowledge
of it are gone. The city Athenian no longer
grumbles, as he did in Aristophanes’s day, that an
invasion has driven him in from the rude plenty and
simple luxuries of his farming life, where with his
figs and his olives, his raisins and his heady wine, he
made holiday before his gods, and roasted his thrush
and his chestnuts with his neighbor over the fire.
All this is gone. There remains, indeed, the old
political lounger, the loafer of the market-place,
ever seeking to obtain some shabby maintenance by
sycophancy or by bullying. This type is not hard
to find in modern Athens, but the old sturdy Acharnian,
as well as the rich horse-breeding Alcmæonid,
are things of the past. Even the large profits to be
made by market-gardening will not tempt them to
adopt this industry, and the great city of Athens is
<pb n='185'/><anchor id='Pg185'/>one of the worst supplied and dearest of capitals,
most of its daily requirements in vegetables, fowls,
eggs, etc., coming in by steamers from islands on
the coast of Thessaly. No part of the country of
Attica can be considered even moderately cultivated,
except the Thriasian plain, and the valley of Kephissus,
reaching from near Dekelea to the sea. This
latter plain, with its fine olive-woods reaching down
across Academus to the region of the old long
walls, is fairly covered with corn and grazing cattle,
with plane trees and poplars. But even here many
of the homesteads are deserted; and the country
seats of the Athenians were often left empty for
years, whenever a band of brigands appeared in the
neighboring mountains, and threatened the outlying
houses with blackmail, if not with bloodier violence.
Of late there is a steady improvement.
</p>

<p>
Nothing can be truer than the admirable description
of Northern Attica given in M. Perrot’s book on
the Attic orators. He is describing Rhamnus, the
home of Antiphon, but his picture is of broader
application.<note place="foot"><p><q rend="post: none">Aujourd’hui tout ce district est presque désert; seuls, quelques
archéologues et quelques artistes affrontent ces gorges pierreuses
et ces scabreux sentiers; on prend alors ce chemin pour
aller de Marathon à Chalcis et revenir à Athènes par Décélie, entre
le Pentélique et Parnès. Ces monuments de Rhamnunte offrent
des traits curieux qui les rendent intéressants pour le voyageur
érudit; mais de plus les ruines mêmes et le site ont assez de beauté
pour dédommager de leur peine ceux qui recherchent surtout le
pittoresque. Je n’oublierai jamais les quelques heures que j’ai
passées là, il y a déjà longtemps, par une radieuse matinée d’avril.
Pendant que nous examinions ce qui restait des anciens sanctuaires
et de leurs défenses, notre guide songeait au déjeuner; il avait
acheté un agneau à l’un de ces pâtres appelés <hi rend='italic'>Vlaques</hi> qui, avec leurs
brebis et leurs chèvres éparses dans les buissons de myrtes et de
lentisques, sont à peu près les seuls habitants de ce canton. Quand
nous revînmes, l’agneau, soutenu sur deux fourches fichées en terre
par un jeune pin sylvestre qui servait de broche, cuisait tout entier
devant un feu clair, et la graisse coulait à grosses gouttes sur les
charbons ardents. Devant notre tapis étendu à l’ombre avait été
préparée une jonchée de verts branchages sur lesquels le succulent
rôti, rapidement découpé par le coutelas d’un berger, laissa bientôt
tomber côtelettes et gigots.</q></p>
    <p><q rend="post: none">Ce qui nous fit prolonger là notre halte après que notre appetit
fut satisfait, ce fut la vue magnifique dont on jouissait de la
plate-forme où nous étions établis, dans un coin de l’acropole. A
nos pieds, c’était la mer, veloutée de chatoyante reflets par le soleil,
par la brise, par les nuages qui passaient au ciel. En face de nous
se dressaient les hautes et sévères côtes de l’Eubée, dominés par la
pyramide du Dirphys. Ce fier sommet était encore tout blanc des
neiges de l’hiver; au contraire, si nous nous retournons vers les
gorges qui se creusaient autour de nous dans la montagne, entre
des parois de marbre rougies et comme hâlées par le soleil, c’était
le printemps de la Grèce dans tout son épanouissement et son éclat.
Dans le fond des ravins, là où un peu d’eau filtrait sous les cailloux,
arbres de Judée et cytises mêlaient leurs brillantes couleurs
au tendre feuillage des platanes, et sur les pentes les plus âpres des
milliers de genêts en fleur étincelaient parmi la verdure des genévriers,
des chênes et des oliviers francs.</q></p>
    <p><q rend="post: none">Dans l’antiquité, toute cette portion du territoire athénien,
qui faisait partie de ce que l’on appelait la <hi rend='italic'>Diakria</hi> ou le <q>haut
pays,</q> sans avoir de gros villages ni une population aussi dense
que celle des plaines d’Athènes ou d’Eleusis, devait pourtant présenter
un aspect assez diffèrent de celui qu’elle offre aujourd’hui;
je me la représente assez semblable à ce que sont maintenant certains
districts montueux de la Grèce moderne où le désir d’éviter
le contact des Turcs avait rejeté et cantonné les Hellènes: il en
était ainsi du Magne, de la Tzaconie, des environs de Karytena en
Arcadie. Partout là, une industrieuse persévérance a mis à profit
tout ce que pouvaient offrir de ressources le sol et le climat. Sur
des pentes abruptes et presque verticales, de petits murs en pierres
sèches s’efforcent de retenir une mince couche de terre végétale;
malgré ces précautions, les grandes pluies de l’hiver et les vents de
l’été en emportent une partie jusqu’au fond de la vallée, sans
jamais se lasser, hommes, femmes, enfants, travaillent sans relâche
à réparer ces dégâts. Que de fois, admirant la patience de ces
sobres et tenaces montagnards, je les ai suivis des yeux pendant
qu’ils allaient ainsi lentement, le dos courbé sous leurs hottes
pleines, gravissant des sentiers sablonneux ou d’étroits escaliers
taillés à même la roche qui leur renvoyait touts les ardeurs du
soleil! Au bout de quelques années, il n’est pas peut-être une
parcelle du terrain dans chacun de ces petits champs qui n’ait fait
plusieurs fois le voyage, qui n’ait glissé jusqu’au bord du torrent
pour être ensuite ramenée pelletée par pelletée, sur une des terrasses
supérieures. Ces sacrifices sont récompensés. Le long du
ruisseau, là où les côtes s’écartent et laissent entre elles un peu
d’espace, l’eau, soigneusement ménagée, mesurée par heures et
par minutes à chaque propriétaire, court bruyante et claire dans
les rigoles; elle arrose des vergers où croissent, suivant les lieux,
soit l’oranger, le citronnier et le grenadier, soit les arbres de nos
climats tempérés, le pêcher, le pommier et le poirier; à leur ombre
grossissent la fève et l’enorme courge. Plus haut, sur les versants
les moins roides et les moins pierreux, là où la légère charrue inventée
par Triptolème a trouvé assez de place pour tracer le sillon,
l’orge et le seigle verdissent au printemps, et, dans les bonnes
années, profitent pour mûrir des tardifs soleils d’automne. Ce qui
d’ailleurs réussit le mieux dans ces montagnes, ce qui paye
vraiment les habitants de leurs peines, c’est l’olivier, dont les puissantes
racines étreignent le roc et semblent faire corps avec lui;
c’est la vigne, qui, d’étage en étage, grimpe presque jusqu’aux sommets.
A l’un et à l’autre, pour donner une huile et un vin qui
seraient les plus savoureux du monde, s’ils étaient mieux préparés,
il suffit de beaucoup de soleil, d’un peu de terre et de quelques
coups de hoyau qui viennent à propos ameublir le sol et le dégager
des plantes parasites.</q></p>
    <p><q>C’est ainsi que dans l’Attique, au temps de sa prospérité,
même les cantons aujourd’hui les plus déserts et les plus stériles
devaient être habités et cultivés. Sur beaucoup de ces croupes où
le roc affleure presque partout, où verdit à peine, aux premiers
jours du printemps, une herbe courte, diaprée d’anémones et de
cistes, qui jaunira dès le mois de mai, il y avait jadis une couche
plus épaisse de terre végétale. Dans les ravins, là où j’ai perdu
plus d’une fois mon chemin en poursuivant la perdrix rouge ou la
bécasse à travers des maquis touffus, on a, pendant bien des siècles,
fait la vendange et la cueillette des olives; c’est ce dont témoignent,
sur les pentes les mieux exposées aux rayons du midi ou du
couchant, des restes de murs et de terrassements que l’on distingue
encore dans l’épaisseur du fourré. Dans les endroits où la culture
était à peu près impossible, des bois de pins, <anchor id="corr188"/><corr sic="aujhourd'hui">aujourd’hui</corr> presque
entièrement détruits, empêchaient la montagne de se dénuder;
dans les clairières et entre les rocs mêmes poussaient la sauge, la
campanule et le thym, toutes ces plantes aromatiques, tous ces
vigoureux arbustes que se plaît à tondre la dent des moutons et des
chèvres.</q></p></note>

<pb n='186'/><anchor id='Pg186'/>

<p>
All these remarks are even more strongly exemplified
by the beautiful country which lies between
<pb n='187'/><anchor id='Pg187'/>Pentelicus and Hymettus, and which is now covered
with forest and brushwood. We passed through this
<pb n='188'/><anchor id='Pg188'/>vale one sunny morning on our way to visit Marathon.
There is, indeed, a road for some miles—the
road to the quarries of Pentelicus—but a very different
one from what the Athenians must have had.
It is now a mere broad track, cut by wheels and
<pb n='189'/><anchor id='Pg189'/>hoofs in the sward; and wherever the ruts become
too deep the driver turns aside, and makes a
parallel track for his own convenience. In summer
days, the dust produced by this sort of road is something
beyond description; and the soil being very
red earth, we have an atmosphere which accounts
to some extent for the remarkable color of the old
buildings of Athens. The way, after turning round
the steep Lycabettus, which, like Arthur’s Seat at
Edinburgh, commands the town close by, passes up
the right side of the undulating plain of Attica, with
the stony but variegated slopes of Hymettus upon
the right, and Pentelicus almost straight ahead. As
soon as the suburbs are passed we meet but one or
two country seats, surrounded with dark cypress
and pepper trees; but outside the sombre green is
a tall, dazzling, white wall, which gives a peculiarly
Oriental character to the landscape. There is cultivation
visible when you look to the westward, where
the village of Kephissia lies, among the groves which
accompany the Kephissus on its course; but up
toward Pentelicus, along the track which must once
have been crowded with carts, and heavy teams, and
shouting drivers, when all the blocks of the Parthenon
were being hurried from their quarry to
adorn the Acropolis—along this famous track there
is hardly a sign of culture. Occasionally, a rough
stubble field showed that a little corn had been cut—an
occasional station, with a couple of soldiers,
<pb n='190'/><anchor id='Pg190'/>shows why more had not been sown. The fear of
brigands had paralyzed industry, and even driven
out the scanty rural population.

It strikes me, when speaking of this road, that the
Greek roads cannot have been at all so well constructed
as the Roman, many of which are still to
be seen in England. Though I went upon the track
of many of them, I but once noticed the vestige of
an old Greek road. There are here and there
wretched remains of Turkish roads—rough angular
stones laid down across the hills, in a close irregular
pavement; but of the great builders of the Parthenon
and of Phyle, of Eleutheræ and of Eleusis,
hardly a patch of road-work has, so far as I know,
remained.
</p>

<p>
There is, indeed, one exception in this very neighborhood,
to which we may now naturally turn. The
traveller who has wondered at the huge blocks of
the Propylæa and the Parthenon, and who has
noticed the exquisite quality of the stone, and the
perfect smoothness which it has preserved to the
present day, will naturally desire to visit the quarry
on Pentelicus from which it was brought. The
marble of Paros is probably the only stone found
superior to it for the purposes of sculpture. It is,
however, harder and of larger grain, so that it must
have been more difficult to work. Experts can tell
the difference between the two marbles, but I confess
that, though M. Rousopoulos endeavored to teach
<pb n='191'/><anchor id='Pg191'/>it to me from specimens in the Acropolis Museum, I
was unable to attain a clear knowledge of the distinction.
The large blocks of Pentelican marble,
however beautiful and fine in grain, seem not unfrequently
to have contained flaws, and possibly the
ascertaining of this defect may of old have been one
of the most difficult duties of the architect. It is
supposed to have been done by sounding the block
with a hammer, a process which the Greeks would
call <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">κωδωνίζειν</foreign>. There are at present, close to the
east front of the Parthenon, several of these rejected
blocks, and the lapse of ages has brought out the
flaw visibly, because damp has had time to penetrate
the stone, and stain its pure whiteness with a dark
seam. But when it came fresh from its native bed,
and was all pure white, I presume the difficulty must
have been considerable. Possibly these blocks on
the Parthenon were injured in their transit, and left
the quarries in sound condition. For in going up
the steep road to these quarries, in more than one
place a similar great block will be found tumbled
aside, and left lying at the very spot where we may
suppose some accident to have happened to crack it.
This road, which in its highest parts has never been
altered, is a steep descent, rudely paved with transverse
courses of stone, like steps in pattern, and may
have had wooden slides laid over it, to bring down
the product of the quarries to the valley. It is well
worth while going up for a night to the fine
monas<pb n='192'/><anchor id='Pg192'/>tery not far off, where there is ample shade of waving
trees and plenty of falling water, in the midst of
steep slopes wooded with the fir—a cool and quiet
retreat in the fierce heat of summer.<note place="foot">

</lg></note> From this
place to the quarries is less than an hour’s walk.
The moderns still draw stone from them, but far
below the spots chosen by the ancients; and, of
course, the remains of the old industry are on an
infinitely grander scale.
</p>

<p>
It is a laborious climb, up a road covered with
small fragments of stone. But at last, beneath a
great face of marble all chipped with the work of
ancient hands, there is a large cool cavern, with
water dripping from the roof into ice-cold pools
below, and besides it a quaint grotto chapel, with
its light still burning, and stone seats around, where
the traveller may rest. This place seems to have
been the main source of the old Athenian buildings.
The high face of the rock above it is chipped, as I
have said, with small and delicate cutting, and hangs
over, as if they had removed it beneath, in order
to bring down the higher pieces more easily. Of
course, they could not, and probably if they could,
would not, have blasted the stone; and, so far as I
know, we are not informed by what process they
<pb n='193'/><anchor id='Pg193'/>managed to loosen and bring down the great blocks
from their sites. The surface of the rock testifies
to the use of some small and delicate chisel. But
whatever the process, they must have had machinery
of which we have lost all record, for no amount of
manual work could possibly have accomplished what
they did in a few years, and accomplished it with
a delicacy which shows complete control of their
materials. The beautifully fitted walls of the
chamber inside the left wing of the Propylæa preserve
an interesting piece of detail on the face of
each square block, which is perfectly fitted to its
fellows; there still remains a rough knob jutting
out from the centre, evidently the handle used for
lifting the stone, and usually removed when all the
building was completely finished. The expenses
of war and the dolors of a long siege caused the
Propylæa to remain unfinished, and so this piece of
construction has survived.
</p>

<p>
The view from the top of Pentelicus is, of course,
very striking, and those who have no time or inclination
to spend a day at Marathon itself are usually
content with a very fine view of the bay and the
opposite mountains of Eubœa, which can thence be
had. But it is indeed a pity, now that the country
is generally quite safe, that after so long a journey
as that from England to Athens, people should turn
back without completing the additional fifteen miles
<pb n='194'/><anchor id='Pg194'/>which brings them to the site of the great battle
itself.
</p>

<p>
As we leave the track which leads up to the
monastery above mentioned, the country becomes
gradually covered with shrubs, and then with
stunted trees—generally old fir-trees, all hacked
and carved and wounded for the sake of their resin,
which is so painfully obtrusive in Greek wine. But
in one place there is, by way of change, a picturesque
bridge over a rapid rocky-bedded river, which is
completely hidden with rich flowering oleanders, and
in which we found sundry Attic women, of the
poorer class, washing their clothes. The woods in
this place were wonderfully rich and scented, and
the sound of the turtle doves was heard in the land.
Presently we came upon the thickly wooded corner,
which was pointed out to us as the spot where our
unfortunate countrymen were captured in 1870, and
carried up the slopes of Pentelicus, to be sacrificed
to the blundering of the English Minister or the
Greek Ministry,—I could not decide which,—and
more certainly to their own chivalry; for while all
the captured Greeks escaped during the pursuit, our
English gentlemen would not break their parole.
These men are now held by the better Greeks to
be martyrs for the good of Greece; for this outrage
first forced the Government to take really vigorous
measures for the safety of the country. The whole
band were gradually captured and executed, till at
<pb n='195'/><anchor id='Pg195'/>last Takos, their chief, was caught in Peloponnesus,
three or four years ago, and hanged at Athens. So
it came that I found the country (on all my visits,
’75, ’77, ’84, ’89) apparently as safe as Ireland is
to a traveller, and we required neither escort, nor
arms, nor any precautions whatever.
</p>

<p>
We had, indeed, a missive from the Greek Prime
Minister, which we presented to the Chief Police
Officer of each town—a gentleman in the usual
scarlet cap and white petticoats, but carrying a great
dog-whip as the sign of his office. This custom,
strange to say, dates from the days of Aristophanes.
But the Prime Minister warned us that, though things
were now safe, there was no permanent security.
Any revolution in the neighborhood (such, for example,
as that in Herzegovina, which at that time had
not yet broken out) might, he said, send over the Turkish
frontier a number of outlaws or other fugitives,
who would support themselves by levying blackmail
on the peasantry, and then on travellers. We were
assured that the Morea, which does not afford an
easy escape into Turkey, has been for years perfectly
secure, and I found it so in several subsequent
journeys. So, then, any traveller desirous of seeing
the Peloponnesus—Sparta, Olympia, Mantinea,
Argos, or even Central Greece—may count on doing
so with safety. Not so the visitor to Tempe and
Mount Pindus.<note place="foot">Since M. Trikoupi’s long and effective administration,
    brigandage was so effectually put down that, although there were
plenty of brigands in Mount Olympus close to the frontier, it
was perfectly safe to wander about in Northern Greece up to the
vale of Tempe. Such was the state of things in 1889. Whether
his recent successor will keep as good order remains to be seen.</note> The Professors of the University
<pb n='196'/><anchor id='Pg196'/>with whom I talked were, indeed, of a more sanguine
opinion. They did not anticipate any recurrence
of the danger: they considered Greece one of the
safest and quietest of countries. Moreover, in one
point they all seemed agreed. It was perfectly certain
that the presence of bandits would be at once
known at Athens. Why this was so, I was not
informed, nor whether travellers would be at once
informed also. In any case, either M. Trikoupi or
the British Minister can be perfectly relied upon for
advice in this matter.
</p>

<p>
So much for the safety of travelling in Greece,
which is suggested by the melancholy fate of Mr.
Vyner and his friends, though that event is now so
long past. But one point more. It is both idle and
foolish to imagine that revolvers and daggers are the
best protection against Greek bandits, should they
reappear. They never attack where they are visible.
The first notice given to the traveller is the sight of
twenty or thirty muzzles pointed at him from the
covert, with a summons to surrender. Except, therefore,
the party be too numerous to be so surrounded
and <hi rend='italic'>visé</hi>, so that some could fight, even were others
shot—except in such a case, arms are only an
addi<pb n='197'/><anchor id='Pg197'/>tional prize, and a tempting one, for the clephts. It
is, indeed, very seldom that the carrying of arms is
to be recommended to any traveller in any land.
</p>

<p>
As we ascended the long saddle of country which
lies between Pentelicus and Hymettus, we came
upon a fine olive-wood, with the same enormous
stems which had already excited our wonder in the
groves of Academe. Indeed, some of the stems in
this wood were the largest we had seen, and made
us think that they may have been there since the
days when the olive oil of Attica was one of its most
famous products, and its export was even forbidden.
Even then there were ancient stumps—<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">μορίαι</foreign>, as
they were called—which were sacred, and which no
man who rented or bought the land might remove;
a restriction which seems hard to us, but was not so
in Greece, where corn grows freely in the shade of
trees, and is even habitually planted in orchards.
But at all events, these old, gnarled, hollowed
stumps, with their tufts of branches starting from
the <anchor id="corr197"/><corr sic="pollared">pollarded</corr> trunk, are a really classical feature in
the country, and deserve, therefore, a passing notice.
</p>

<p>
When we had got well between the mountains a
new scene unfolded itself. We began to see the
famous old Euripus, with the mountains of Eubœa
over against us; and down to the south, behind
Hymettus, till we reach the extremity of Sunium,
stretched a long tract of mountainous and barren
country which never played a prominent part in
<pb n='198'/><anchor id='Pg198'/>history, but where a conical hill was pointed out to
us as the site of the old deme Brauron. It is,
indeed, surprising how little of Attica was ever
celebrated. Close by the most famous city of the
world are reaches of country which are as obscure
to us as the wilds of Arcadia; and we may suspect
that the shepherds who inhabited the <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">φελλέα</foreign>, or
rocky pastures in the Attic hills, were not much
superior to those whom we now meet herding their
goats in the same region.
</p>

<p>
The plain of Marathon, as everybody knows, is a
long crescent-shaped strip of land by the shore, surrounded
by an amphitheatre of hills, which may be
crossed conveniently in three places, but most easily
toward the south-west, along the road which we
travelled, and which leads directly to Athens.
When the Athenians marched through this broad
and easy passage they found that the Persians had
landed at the northern extremity of the plain—I suppose,
because the water was there sufficiently deep
to let them land conveniently. Most of the shore,
as you proceed southward, is lined on the seaboard
by swamps. The Greek army must have marched
northward along the spurs of Pentelicus, and taken
up their position near the north of the plain. There
was evidently much danger that the Persians would
force a passage through the village of Marathon,
farther toward the north-west. Had they done this,
they might have rounded Pentelicus, and descended
<pb n='199'/><anchor id='Pg199'/>the main plain of Attica, from the valley below
Dekelea. Perhaps, however, this pass was then
guarded by an outlying fort, or by some defences
at Marathon itself. The site of the battle is absolutely
fixed by the great mound, upon which was
placed a lion, which has been carried off, no one
knows when or whither. The mound is exactly an
English mile from the steep slope of one of the hills,
and about half a mile from the sea at present; nor
was there, when I saw it, any difficulty in walking
right to the shore, though a river flows out there,
which shows, by its sedgy banks and lofty reeds, a
tendency to create a marshy tract in rainy weather.
But the mound is so placed that, if it marks the
centre of the battle, the Athenians must have faced
nearly north; and if they faced the sea eastward,
as is commonly stated, this mound must mark the
scene of the conflict on their left wing. The mound
is very large—I suppose thirty feet high—altogether
of earth, so far as we could see, and bears traces of
having been frequently ransacked in search of
antiquities. Dr. Schliemann, its latest investigator,
could find nothing there but prehistoric flint weapons.

</else></pgIf>
<p>
Like almost every view in Greece, the prospect
from this mound is full of beauty and variety—everywhere
broken outlines, everywhere patches of
blue sea, everywhere silence and solitude. Byron
is so much out of fashion now, and so much more
talked about than read—though even that notice of
<pb n='200'/><anchor id='Pg200'/>him is fast disappearing—that I will venture to
remind the reader of the splendid things he has said
of Greece, and especially of this very plain of
Marathon. He was carried away by his enthusiasm
to fancy a great future possible for the country, and
to believe that its desolation and the low condition
of the inhabitants were simply the result of Turkish
tyranny, and not of many natural causes conspiring
for twenty centuries. He paints the Greek brigand
or pirate as many others have painted the <q>noble
savage,</q> with the omission of all his meaner vices.
But in spite of all these faults, who is there who
has felt as he the affecting aspects of this beautiful
land—the tomb of ancient glory—the home of ancient
wisdom—the mother of science, of art, of
philosophy, of politics—the champion of liberty—the
envy of the Persian and the Roman—the
teacher, even still, of modern Europe? It is surely
a great loss to our generation, and a bad sign of its
culture, that the love of more modern poets has
weaned them from the study of one not less great in
most respects, but far greater in one at least—in that
burning enthusiasm for a national cause, in that red-hot
passion for liberty which, even when misapplied,
or wasted upon unworthy objects, is ever one of the
noblest and most stirring instincts of higher man.
</p>

<p>
But Byron may well be excused his raving about
the liberty of the Greeks, for truly their old conflict
at Marathon, where a few thousand ill-disciplined men
<pb n='201'/><anchor id='Pg201'/>repulsed a larger number of still worse disciplined
Orientals, without any recondite tactics—perhaps
even without any very extraordinary heroism—how
is it that this conflict has maintained a celebrity
which has not been equalled by any of the great
battles of the world from that day down to our own?
The courage of the Greeks, as I have elsewhere
shown,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Social Life in Greece</hi>,
    p. <anchor id="corr201"/><corr sic="23">23.</corr></note> was not of the first order. Herodotus
praises the Athenians in this very battle for being
the first Greeks that dared to look the Persians in
the face. Their generals all through history seem
never to feel sure of victory, and always endeavor to
harangue their soldiers into a fury. Instead of advising
coolness, they especially incite to rage—<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ὀργῇ προσμίξωμεν</foreign>, says one of them in Thucydides—as
if any man not in this state would be sure to estimate
the danger fully, and run away. It is, indeed, true
that the ancient battles were hand to hand, and
therefore parallel to our charges of bayonets, which
are said to be very seldom carried out by two opposing
lines, as one of them almost always gives way
before the actual collision takes place. This must
often have occurred in Greek battles, for in one
fought at Amphipolis Brasidas lost seven men; at a
battle at Corinth, mentioned by <anchor id="corr201a"/><corr sic="Xenophen">Xenophon</corr>—an important
battle, too—the slain amounted to eight;<note place="foot">Xen. <hi rend='italic'>Hell.</hi>, iv., 3, § 1. To cite a parallel in modern history:
a writer in the <hi rend='italic'>Pall Mall Gazette</hi> (July 12, 1876) says: <anchor id="corr202b"/><q><corr sic="'">I</corr> witnessed
a battle during the War of Greek Independence. It lasted three
days; the quantity of ammunition expended was enormous, and
the result was one man wounded!</q></note>
<pb n='202'/><anchor id='Pg202'/>and these battles were fought before the days when
whole armies were composed of mercenaries, who
spared one another, as Ordericus Vitalis says, <q>for
the love of God, and out of good feeling for the
fraternity of arms.</q> So, then, the loss of 192
Athenians, including some distinguished men, was
rather a severe one. As to the loss of the Persians,
I so totally disbelieve the Greek accounts of such
things that it is better to pass it by in silence.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps most readers will be astonished to hear
of the Athenian army as undisciplined, and of the
science of war as undeveloped, in those times. Yet
I firmly believe this was so. The accounts of battles
by almost all the historians are so utterly vague, and
so childishly conventional, that it is evident that
these gentlemen were not only quite ignorant of the
science of war, but could not easily find any one to
explain it to them. We know that the Spartans—the
most admired of all Greek warriors—were chiefly
so admired because they devised the system of subordinating
officers to one another within the same
detachment, like our gradation from colonel to corporal.
Orders were passed down from officer to
officer, instead of being bawled out by a herald to a
whole army. But this superiority of the Spartans,
who were really disciplined, and went into battle
<pb n='203'/><anchor id='Pg203'/>coolly, like brave men, certainly did not extend to
strategy, but was merely a question of better drill.
As soon as any real strategist met them they were
helpless. Thus Iphicrates, when he devised Wellington’s
plan of meeting their attacking column in
line, and using missiles, succeeded against them,
even without firearms: thus Epaminondas, when he
devised Napoleon’s plan of massing troops on a single
point, while keeping his enemy’s line occupied, defeated
them without any considerable struggle. As
for that general’s great battle of Mantinea, the ancient
Rossbach, which seems really to have been
introduced by some complicated strategical movements,
we owe our partial knowledge to the grudging
aid of the soldier Xenophon. But both generals
were in the distant future when the battle of Marathon
was being fought.
</p>

<p>
Yet what signifies all this criticism? In spite of
all skepticism, in spite of all contempt, the battle of
Marathon, whether badly or well fought, and the
troops at Marathon, whether well or ill trained, will
ever be more famous than any other battle or army,
however important or gigantic its dimensions. Even
in this very war, the battles of Salamis and Platæa
were vastly more important and more hotly contested.
The losses were greater, the results were
more enduring, yet thousands have heard of Marathon
to whom the other names are unknown. So much
for literary ability—so much for the power of talk<pb n='204'/><anchor id='Pg204'/>ing well about one’s deeds. Marathon was fought by
Athenians; the Athenians eclipsed the other Greeks
as far as the other Greeks eclipsed the rest of the
world, in literary power. This battle became the
literary property of the city, hymned by poet, cited
by orator, told by aged nurse, lisped by stammering
infant; and so it has taken its position, above all
criticism, as one of the great decisive battles which
assured the liberty of the West against Oriental despotism.
</p>

<p>
The plain in the present day is quite bare of trees,
and, as Colonel Leake observed, appears to have
been so at the time of the battle, from the vague
account of its evolutions. There was a little corn
and a few other crops about the great tumulus; and
along the seashore, whither we went to bathe, there
was a large herd of cows and oxen—a sight not
very usual in Greece. When we rushed into the
shallow blue water, striving to reach swimming
depth, we could not but think of the scene when
Kynægirus and his companions rushed in armed to
stop the embarkation of the Persians. On the
shore, then teeming with ships of war, with transports,
with fighting and flying men, there was now
no sign of life, but ourselves in the water, and the
lazy cattle and their silent herdsmen looking upon
us in wonder; for, though very hot, it was only May,
and the modern Greek never thinks it safe to bathe
till at least the end of June—in this like his Italian
<pb n='205'/><anchor id='Pg205'/>neighbor. There was not a single ship or boat in
the straits; there was no sign of life or of population
on the coast of Eubœa. There was everywhere
that solitude which so much struck Byron, as it
strikes every traveller in Modern Greece. There
was not even the child or beggar, with coins and
pieces of pottery, who is so troublesome about Italian
ruins, and who has even lately appeared at the Parthenon,
the theatre at Argos, and a few other places
in Greece. We asked the herdsman for remnants
of arms or pieces of money: he had seen such
things picked up, but knew nothing of their value.
Lord Byron tells us he was offered the purchase
of the whole plain (six miles by two) for about
£900. It would have been a fine speculation for
an antiquarian: but I am surprised, as he was,
rather at the greatness than at the smallness of
the price. The Greek Government might very
well, even now, grant the fee-simple to any one
who would pay the ordinary taxes on property,
which are not, I was told, very heavy. But still the
jealousy of the nation would not tolerate a foreign
speculator.
</p>

<p>
I have already spoken (<ref target="Pg154">p. 154</ref>) of the position of
the pass of Daphne, and how it leads the traveller
over the ridge which separates the plain of the
Kephissus from the Thriasian plain. I have also
spoken at length of the country about the Kephissus,
with its olive woods and its nightingales. When we
<pb n='206'/><anchor id='Pg206'/>go through the pass of Daphne—of its monastery I
shall speak in another chapter—a perfectly new
view opens before us. We see under us the Thriasian
plain, well covered with ripening corn and other
crops; we see at the far side of the crescent-shaped
bay the remains of Eleusis. Behind it, and all
round to the right up to where we stand, is an amphitheatre
of hills—the spurs of Mount Parnes,
which from Phyle reach due south down to where
we stand, and due west to the inland of the Thriasian
plain, till they meet and are confounded with
the slopes of Cithæron, which extend for miles away
behind Eleusis. On the sea-side, to our left, lies the
island of Salamis, so near the coast that the sea
seems a calm inland lake, lying tortuously between
the hills.
</p>

<p>
Many points of Greek history become plain to us
by this view. We see how true was the epithet
<q>rocky Salamis,</q> for the island, though it looks very
insignificant on our maps, contains lofty mountains,
with very bare and rocky sides. The student of
Greek geography in maps should note this feature.
Thus, Ithaca on the map does not suggest the real
Ithaca, which from most points looks like a high
and steep mountain standing out of the sea. We
begin also to see how Salamis was equally <hi rend='italic'>convenient</hi>
(as the Irish say) to both Megara and Attica, if we
consider that Eleusis was strictly a part of Attica.
The harbor of the Peiræus, for example, would be
<pb n='207'/><anchor id='Pg207'/>quite useless if an enemy were watching it from
Salamis. But we also come to see the sense of the
old legend, that Eleusis had originally a separate
king or government from that of Athens, and that
the two cities once carried on war against each other.
The towns are but a few miles apart; but their respective
plains are so distinctly and completely separated
by the pass of Daphne, that not one acre of
the territory of Eleusis can be seen from Athens,
nor of Athens from Eleusis. So also, lastly, we
come to feel how natural is the remark of Thucydides,
that the population of Athens, when the Lacedæmonians
invaded Attica, and came no farther than
the Thriasian plain, did not feel the terrors of a hostile
invasion, as the enemy was not in sight; but
when he crossed the pass, and began to ravage
Acharnæ and the vale of Kephissus, then indeed,
though Eleusis was just as near, and just as much
their own, they felt the reality of the invasion, and
were for the first time deeply dejected. This is a
good example of that combined farness and nearness
which is so characteristic about most neighboring
cities in Greece.

<p>
The wretched modern village of Eleusis is picturesquely
situated near the sea, on the old site, and
there are still to be seen the ruins, not only of the
famous temple of Demeter, but also of the Propylæa,
built apparently in imitation of that of Mnesicles on
the Acropolis at Athens, though the site of both
<pb n='208'/><anchor id='Pg208'/>temple and Propylæa are at Eleusis low, and in no
way striking.
</p>

<p>
These celebrated ruins are wretchedly defaced.
Not a column or a wall is now standing, and we can
see nothing but vast fragments of pillars and capitals,
and a great pavement, all of white marble,
along which the ancient wheel-tracks are distinctly
visible. There are also underground vaults of small
dimensions, which, the people tell you, were intended
for the Mysteries. We that knew what vast crowds
attended there would not give credence to this ignorant
guess; and indeed we knew from distinct evidence
that the great ceremony took place in a large
building specially constructed for the purpose. The
necessary darkness was obtained by performing the
more solemn rites at night; not by going down beneath
the surface of the earth.
</p>

<p>
The Greek <hi rend='italic'>savants</hi> have at last laid open, and
explained, the whole plan of the temple, which was
built by Ictinus, in Pericles’s time, but apparently
restored after a destructive fire by Roman architects
copying faithfully the ancient style. The excavators
have shown that the shrine had strange peculiarities.
And this is exactly what we should
expect. For although no people adhered more
closely to traditional forms in their architecture, no
people were more ready to modify these forms with
a view to practical requirements. Thus, as a rule,
the cella, or inner chamber of the temple, only
con<pb n='209'/><anchor id='Pg209'/>tained the statue of the god, and was consequently
small and narrow. In the temple at Eleusis has
been found a great inner chamber about 59 yards
by 54, hewn out of the rock in the rear of the edifice,
and capable of accommodating a large assembly.<note place="foot">So Strabo describes it, <hi rend='small'>IX.</hi> 1, § 12. For further details consult
the <hi rend='italic'>Guide Joanne</hi> for Athens (1888), p. 201.</note>
Here then it seems the initiated—probably
those of the higher degree, <hi rend='italic'>epoptæ</hi> as they were
called—witnessed those services <q>which brought
them peace in this world, and a blessed hope for
the world to come.</q>
</p>

<p>
The way into the temple was adorned with two
Propylæa—one of the classical period, and by Philo
(311 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>), another set up by a Roman, App. Claudius
Pulcher, in 48 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>, after you had passed
through the former. The great temple, raised upon
a natural platform, looks out toward Salamis, and
the narrow line of azure which separates it from the
land. Turning to the left as you stand at the temple
front, the eye wanders over the rich plain of
Eleusis, now dotted over with villages, and colored
(in April) with the rich brown of ploughing and the
splendid green of sprouting wheat. This plain had
multiplied its wealth manifold since I first saw it,
and led us to hope that the peasants were waking
up to the great market which is near them at Athens.
The track of the old sacred way along the Thriasian
plain is often visible, for much of the sea-coast is
<pb n='210'/><anchor id='Pg210'/>marshy, so the road was cut out in many places
along the spurs of the rocky hill of Daphne. The
present road goes between the curious salt-lakes
(Rheitoi) and the shore—salt-lakes full of sea-fish,
and evidently fed by great natural springs, for there
is a perpetual strong outflow to the tideless sea. I
know not whether this natural curiosity has been
explained by the learned.
</p>

<p>
It is, of course, the celebrated Mysteries—the
<hi rend='italic'>Greater Eleusinia</hi>, as they were called—which give
to the now wretched village of Eleusis, with its
hopeless ruins, so deep an interest. This wonderful
feast, handed down from the remotest antiquity,
maintained its august splendor all through the
greater ages of Greek history, down to the times
of decay and trifling—when everything else in the
country had become mean and contemptible. Even
Cicero, who was of the initiated himself, a man of
wide culture and of a skeptical turn of mind—even
Cicero speaks of it as <hi rend='italic'>the</hi> great product of the culture
of Athens. <q>Much that is excellent and divine,</q>
says he,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>De Legg.</hi>, <hi rend='small'>II.</hi> 14, § 36.</note> <q>does Athens seem to me to have
produced and added to our life, but nothing better
than those Mysteries, by which we are formed and
moulded from a rude and savage life to humanity;
and indeed in the Mysteries we perceive the real
principles of life, and learn not only to live happily,
but to die with a fairer hope.</q> These are the words
<pb n='211'/><anchor id='Pg211'/>of a man writing, as I have said; in the days of the
ruin and prostration of Greece. Can we then wonder
at the enthusiastic language of the Homeric
Hymn,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>in Cer.</hi> v. 480.</note> of Pindar,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Thren.</hi> (frag.)</note>
    of Sophocles,<note place="foot"><anchor id="corr211"/><hi rend='italic'><corr sic="Oed.">Œd.</corr> Col.</hi> 1042.</note> of Aristophanes,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Ran.</hi> 455.</note>
of Plato,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Phæd.</hi> cc. 29, 30.</note> of Isocrates,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Paneg.</hi> § 6.</note>
    of Chrysippus<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Etym. Mag.</hi>, s. v. <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">τελετή</foreign>.</note>? Every
manner of writer—religious poet, worldly poet, skeptical
philosopher, orator—all are of one mind about
this, far the greatest of all the religious festivals of
Greece.
</p>

<p>
To what did it owe this transcendent character?
It was not because men here worshipped exceptional
gods, for the worship of Demeter and Cora was an
old and widely diffused cult all over Greece: and
there were other Eleusinia in various places. It was
not because the ceremony consisted of mysteries, of
hidden acts and words, which it was impious to
reveal, and which the initiated alone might know.
For the habit of secret worship was practised in
every state, where special clans were charged with
the care of special secret services, which no man
else might know. Nay, even within the ordinary
homes of the Greeks there were these Mysteries.
Neither was it because of the splendor of the temple
and its appointments, which never equalled the
Panathenæa at the Parthenon, or the riches of
Delphi, or Olympia. There is only one reasonable
<pb n='212'/><anchor id='Pg212'/>cause, and it is that upon which all our serious
authorities agree. The doctrine taught in the Mysteries
was a faith which revealed hopeful things
about the world to come; and which—not so much
as a condition, but as a consequence, of this clearer
light, this higher faith—made them better citizens
and better men. This faith was taught them in the
Mysteries through symbols,<note place="foot">There seems no doubt that some of these symbols, derived
from old nature-worship, were very gross, and quite inconsistent
with modern notions of religion. But even these were features
hallowed and ennobled by the spirit of the celebrants, whose
reverence blinded their eyes, while lifting up their hearts.</note> through prayer and
fasting, through wild rejoicings; but, as Aristotle
expressly tells us, it was reached not by intellectual
persuasion, but by a change into a new moral state—in
fact, by being spiritually revived.
</p>

<p>
Here, then, we have the strangest and most striking
analogy to our religion in the Greek mythology;
for here we have a higher faith publicly taught,—any
man might present himself to be initiated,—and
taught, not in opposition to the popular creed, but
merely by deepening it, and showing to the ordinary
worldling its spiritual power. The belief in the
Goddess Demeter and her daughter, the queen of
the nether world, was, as I have said, common all
over Greece; but even as nowadays we are told that
there may be two kinds of belief of the same truths—one
of the head and another of the heart—just
<pb n='213'/><anchor id='Pg213'/>as the most excellent man of the world, who believes
all the creeds of the Church, is called an unbeliever,
in the higher sense, by our Evangelical Christians;
so the ordinary Greek, though he prayed and offered
at the Temple of Demeter, was held by the initiated
at the Mysteries to be wallowing in the mire of
ignorance, and stumbling in the night of gloom—he
was held to live without real light, and to die without
hope, in wretched despair.<note place="foot">In the fragments of Plutarch’s <hi rend='italic'>De anima</hi> there are some very
striking passages on this subject. <q>After this,</q> he says, evidently
describing some part of the ceremony, <q>there came a great light,
there were shown pure places and meadows, with dances, and all
that was splendid and holy to see and hear, in which he who is
now perfected by <anchor id="corr213"/><corr sic="initation">initiation</corr>, and has obtained freedom and remission,
joins in the devotions, with his head crowned, in the company
of pure and holy men, and beholds from thence the unclean uninitiated
crowd of mortals in deep mire and mist, trodden down
and crowded by each other, but in fear of death, adhering to their
ills through want of faith in the goods beyond. Since from these
you may clearly see that the connection of the soul with the body
is a coercion against nature.</q></note>

<p>
The very fact that it was not lawful to divulge the
Mystery has prevented the many writers who knew
it from giving us any description by which we might
gain a clear idea of this wonderful rite. We have
hints of various sacred vessels, of various priests
known by special technical names; of dramatic
representations of the rape of Cora, and of the
grief of her mother; of her complaints before Zeus,
and the final reconciliation. We hear of scenes of
<pb n='214'/><anchor id='Pg214'/>darkness and fear, in which the hopeless state of
the unbelievers was portrayed; of light and glory,
to which the convert attained, when at last his eyes
were opened to the knowledge of good and evil.
</p>

<p>
But all these things are fragmentary glimpses, as
are also the doctrines hinted of the Unity of God,
and of atonement by sacrifice. There remains
nothing clear and certain, but the unanimous verdict
as to the greatness, the majesty, and the awe of the
services, and as to the great spiritual knowledge and
comfort which they conveyed. The consciousness
of guilt was not, indeed, first taught by them, but
was felt generally, and felt very keenly by the
Greek mind. These Mysteries were its Gospel of
reconciliation with the offended gods.

<head type="sub">FROM ATHENS TO THEBES—THE PASSES OF PARNES AND OF CITHÆRON, ELEUTHERÆ, PLATÆA.</head>

<p>
No ordinary student, looking at the map of Attica
and Bœotia, can realize the profound and complete
separation between these two countries. Except at
the very northern extremity, where the fortified
town of Oropus guarded an easy boundary, all the
frontier consists not merely of steep mountains, but
of parallel and intersecting ridges and gorges, which
contain indeed a few alpine valleys, such as that of
Œnoe, but which are, as a rule, wild and barren,
easily defensible by a few against many, and totally
unfit for the site of any considerable town, or any
advanced culture. As I before stated, the traveller
can pass through by Dekelea, or he can pass most
directly by Phyle, the fort which Thrasybulus seized
when he desired to reconquer Athens with his democratic
exiles. The historians usually tell us <q>that
he seized <hi rend='italic'>and fortified</hi> Phyle</q>; a statement which
the present aspect of it seems to render very doubtful
indeed. It is quite impossible that the great hill-fort
of the very finest Attic building, which is still
remaining and admired by all, could have been
<pb n='216'/><anchor id='Pg216'/><q>knocked up</q> by Thrasybulus and his exiles.
The careful construction and the enormous extent
of the building compel us to suppose it the work of
a rich state, and of a deliberate plan of fortification.
It seems very unlikely, for these reasons, that it was
built after the days of Thrasybulus, or that so important
a point of attack should have been left unguarded
in the greater days of Athens. I am therefore
convinced that the fort, being built long before,
and being, in fact, one of the well-known fortified
demes through Attica, had been to some extent dismantled,
or allowed to fall into decay, at the end of
the Peloponnesian War, but that its solid structure
made it a matter of very little labor for the exiles
to render it strong and easily defensible.
</p>

<p>
This is one of the numerous instances in which a
single glance at the locality sets right an historical
statement that has eluded suspicion for ages. The
fort of Phyle, like that of Eleutheræ, of which I
shall speak, and like those of Messene and of Orchomenus,
is built of square blocks of stone, carefully
cut, and laid together without a particle of rubble or
cement, but so well fitted as to be able to resist the
wear of ages better than almost any other building.
I was informed by M. <anchor id="corr216"/><corr sic="Emile">Émile</corr> Burnouf, that in the
case of a fort at Megara, which I did not see, there
are even polygonal blocks, of which the irregular and
varying angles are fitted with such precision that it
is difficult, as in the case of the Parthenon, to detect
<pb n='217'/><anchor id='Pg217'/>the joinings of the stones. The blocks are by no
means so colossal in these buildings as in the great
ruins about Mycenæ; but the fitting is closer, and
the sites on which we find them very lofty, and with
precipitous ascents. This style of building is specially
mentioned by Thucydides (<hi rend='small'>I.</hi> 93) as being employed
in the building of the walls of the Peiræus
in the days of Themistocles, apparently in contrast to
the rude and hurried construction of the city walls.
But he speaks of the great stones being not only cut
square, but fastened with clamps of iron soldered
with lead. I am not aware that any traces of this
are found in the remaining hill-forts. The walls of
the Peiræus have, unfortunately, long since almost
totally disappeared.
</p>

<p>
The way from Athens to Phyle leads north-west
through the rich fields of the old deme of Acharnæ;
and we wonder at first why they should be so noted
as charcoal-burners. But as we approach Mount
Parnes, we find that the valley is bounded by
tracts of hillside fit for nothing but pine forest. A
vast deal of wooding still remains; it is clear that
these forests were the largest and most convenient
to supply Athens with firewood or charcoal. As
usual, there are many glens and river-courses
through the rugged country through which we
ascend—here and there a village, in one secluded
nook a little monastery, hidden from the world, if
not from its cares. There is the usual Greek
vege<pb n='218'/><anchor id='Pg218'/>tation beside the path; not perhaps luxuriant to our
Northern eyes, but full of colors of its own—the
glowing anemone, the blood-red poppy, the delicate
cistus on a rocky surface, with foliage rather gray
and silvery than green. The pine-trees sound, as
the breeze sweeps up the valleys, and lavish their
vigorous fragrance through the air.
</p>

<p>
There is something inexpressibly bracing in this
solitude, if solitude it can be called, where the forest
speaks to the eye and ear, and fills the imagination
with the mystery of its myriad forms. Now and then
too the peculiar cadence of those bells which hardly
varies throughout all the lands of the south, tells
you that a flock of goats, or goat-like sheep, is near,
attended by solemn, silent children, whose eyes seem
to have no expression beyond that of vague wonder
in their gaze. These are the flocks of some village
below, not those of the nomad Vlachs, who bring
with them their tents and dogs, and make gipsy
encampments in the unoccupied country.
</p>

<p>
At last we see high over us the giant fort of Phyle—set
upon a natural precipice, which defends it
amply for half its circuit. The point of occupation
was well chosen, for while within sight of Athens,
and near enough to afford a sure refuge to those who
could escape by night and fly to the mountain, its
distance (some 15 miles) and the steep and rugged
ascent, made it impossible for weak and aged people
to crowd into it and mar the efficiency of its garrison.
<pb n='219'/><anchor id='Pg219'/>With the increase of his force Thrasybulus began
successful raids into the plain, then a rapid movement
to Peiræus; ultimately, as may be read in all
histories, he accomplished the liberation of his native
city.
</p>

<p>
We did not pass into Bœotia by the way of Phyle,
preferring to take the longer route through Eleusis.
But no sooner had we left Eleusis than we began to
ascend into the rough country, which is the preface
to the wild mountain passes of Cithæron. It is,
indeed, very difficult to find where one range of
mountains begins and another ends, anywhere
throughout Greece. There is generally one high
peak, which marks a whole chain or system of
mountains, and after which the system is called;
but all closer specification seems lost, on account of
the immense number of ridges and points which
crowd upon the view in all directions. Thus the
chain of Parnes, after throwing out a spur toward
the south, which divides the Athenian and the
Thriasian plains, sweeps round the latter in a sort
of amphitheatre, and joins the system of Cithæron
(Kitheron), which extends almost parallel with
Parnes. A simple look at a good map explains
these things by supplementing mere description.
The only thing which must be specially enforced
is, that all the region where a plain is not expressly
named is made up of broken mountain ridges and
rocky defiles, so that it may fairly be called an
<pb n='220'/><anchor id='Pg220'/>alpine country. A fellow-traveller, who had just
been in Norway, was perpetually struck with its
resemblance to the Norwegian highlands.
</p>

<p>
I will only mention one other fact which illustrates
the consequent isolation. We have a river Kephissus
in the plain of Athens. As soon as we cross the
pass of Daphne we have another Kephissus in the
Thriasian plain. Within a day’s journey, or nearly
so, we have another Kephissus, losing itself in the
lake Copais, not far from Orchomenus. This repetition
of the same name shows how little intercourse
people have in the country, how little they travel,
and how there is no danger of confusing these identical
names. Such a fact, trifling as it is, illustrates
very powerfully the isolation which the Greek mountains
produce.
</p>

<p>
There is a good road from Athens to Thebes,—a
very unusual thing in Greece,—and we were able
to drive with four horses, after a fashion which
would have seemed very splendid in old days. But,
strange to say, the old Greek fashion of driving four
horses abreast, two being yoked to the pole, and two
outriggers, or <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">παράσειροι</foreign>, as they were called, has
disappeared from Greece, whereas it still survives in
Southern Italy. On the other hand the Greeks are
more daring drivers than the Italians, being indeed
braver in all respects, and, when a road is to be had,
a very fast pace is generally kept up.
</p>

<p>
As usual, the country was covered with
brush<pb n='221'/><anchor id='Pg221'/>wood, and with numbers of old gnarled fir-trees,
which bore everywhere upon their stems the great
wounds of the hatchet, made to extract the resin for
the flavoring of wine. Rare flocks of goats, with
their peculiar, dull, tinkling bells—bells which have
the same make and tone all through Calabria, through
Sicily, and through Greece—were the only sign of
human occupation or of population. But when you
look for houses, there is nothing in the shape of wall
or roof, save an occasional station, where, but a few
years since, soldiers were living, to keep the road
safe from bandits. At last we came upon the camp
of some Vlach shepherds—a thing reminding one
far more of a gipsy camp than anything else—a few
dark-brown skins falling over two upright poles, so
as to form a roof-shaped tent, of which the entrance
looked so absolutely black as to form quite a patch
in the landscape. There is mere room for lying in
these tents by night; and, I suppose, in the summer
weather most of these wild shepherds will not condescend
even to this shelter.<note place="foot">The Greeks always regard these nomads as foreigners in
race, and incapable of any settled or civilized life. They do great
mischief to young trees and fences, which they never respect. Yet
when arrested for doing mischief they are protected by the sympathies
of the Greeks, who hate all coercion, however reasonable.</note>
</p>

<p>
After some hours’ drive we reached a grassy dell,
shaded by large plane-trees, where a lonely little
public-house—if I may so call it—of this
construc<pb n='222'/><anchor id='Pg222'/>tion invited us to stop for watering the horses, and
inspecting more closely the owner. There was the
usual supply of such places—red and white wine in
small casks, excellent fresh water, and <hi rend='italic'>lucumia</hi>, or
Turkish delight. Not only had the owner his belt
full of knives and pistols, but there was hanging up
in a sort of rack a most picturesque collection of
swords and guns—all made in Turkish fashion, with
ornamented handles and stocks, and looking as
if they might be more dangerous to the sportsman
than to his game. While we were being served by
this wild-looking man, in this suspicious place—in
fact, it looked like the daily resort of bandits—his
wife, a comely young woman, dressed in the usual
dull blue, red, and white, disappeared through the
back way, and hid herself among the trees. This
fear of being seen by strangers—no doubt caused by
jealousy among men, and, possibly, by an Oriental
tone in the country—is a striking feature through
most parts of Greece. It is said to be a remnant of
the Turkish influence, but seems to me to lie deeper,
and to be even an echo of the old Greek days. The
same feeling is prevalent in most parts of Sicily. In
the towns there you seldom see ladies in the streets;
and in the evenings, except when the play-going
public is returning from the theatre, there are only
men visible.
</p>

<p>
After leaving this resting-place, about eleven in
the morning, we did not meet a village, or even a
<pb n='223'/><anchor id='Pg223'/>single house till we had crossed Cithæron, after six
in the evening, and descried the modern hamlet of
Platæa on the slopes to our left. But once or twice
through the day a string of four or five mules, with
bright, richly striped rugs over their wooden saddles,
and men dressed still more brightly sitting lady-fashion
on them, were threading their way along the
winding road. The tinkling of the mules’ bells and
the wild Turkish chants of the men were a welcome
break in the uniform stillness of the journey. The
way becomes gradually wilder and steeper, though
often descending to cross a shady valley, which opens
to the right and left, in a long, narrow vista, and
shows blue far-off hills of other mountain chains.
One of these valleys was pointed out to us as Œnoe,
an outlying deme of Attica, fortified in Periclean
days, and which the Peloponnesian army attacked,
as Thucydides tells us, and failed to take, on their
invasion of Attica at the opening of the war. There
are two or three strong square towers in this valley,
close to the road, but not the least like any old
Greek fort, and quite incapable of holding any garrison.
The site is utterly unsuitable, and there
seemed no remains of any walled town.
</p>

<p>
These facts led me to reflect upon the narrative
of Thucydides, who evidently speaks of Œnoe as
the border fort of Attica, and yet says not a word
about Eleutheræ, which is really the border, the
great fort, and the key to the passes of Cithæron.
<pb n='224'/><anchor id='Pg224'/>The first solution which suggests itself is, that the
modern Greeks have given the wrong names to these
places, and that by Œnoe Thucydides really means
the place now known as Eleutheræ.<note place="foot">Colonel Leake already felt these difficulties, and moves
Eleutheræ a few miles to the south-west. But Œnoe and Eleutheræ
must have been close together, from the allusion in the <hi rend='italic'>Antiope</hi>
of Euripides. Cf. Eurip., frag. 179 (ed. Nauck), and the
passages quoted there.</note> Most decidedly,
if the fort which is now there existed at the opening
of the Peloponnesian War, he cannot possibly have
overlooked it in his military history of the campaign.
And yet it seems certain that we must place the
building of this fort at the epoch of Athens’s greatness,
when Attic influence was paramount in Bœotia,
and when the Athenians could, at their leisure, and
without hindrance, construct this fort, which commands
the passes into Attica, before they diverge
into various valleys, about the region of the so-called
Œnoe.
</p>

<p>
For, starting from Thebes, the slope of Cithæron
is a single unbroken ascent up to the ridge, through
which, nearly over the village of Platæa, there is a
cut that naturally indicates the pass. But when the
traveller has ascended from Thebes to this point he
finds a steep descent into a mountainous and broken
region, where he must presently choose between a
gorge to the right or to the left, and must wander
about zigzag among mountains, so as to find his way
<pb n='225'/><anchor id='Pg225'/>toward Athens. And although I did not examine
all the passes accurately, it was perfectly obvious
that, as soon as the first defile was left behind, an
invader could find various ways of eluding the defenders
of Attica, and penetrating into the Thriasian
plain, or, by Phyle, into that of Athens. Accordingly,
the Athenians choose a position of remarkable
strength, just inside the last crowning ascent, where
all the ways converge to pass the crest of the mountain
into Platæa. Here a huge rock, interposing
between the mountains on each side, strives, as it
were, to bar the path, which accordingly divides
like a torrent bed, and passes on either side, close
under the walls of the fort which occupies the top
of the rock. From this point the summit of the
pass is about two or three miles distant, and easily
visible, so that an outpost there, commanding a view
of the whole Theban plain, could signal any approach
to the fort with ample notice.
</p>

<p>
The position of the fort at Phyle, above described,
is very similar. It lies within a mile of the top of
the pass, on the Attic side, within sight of Athens,
and yet near enough to receive the scouts from the
top, and resist all sudden attack. No force could
invade Attica without leaving a large force to besiege
it.
</p>

<p>
Looking backward into Attica, the whole mountainous
tract of Œnoe is visible; and, though we
cannot now tell the points actually selected, there
<pb n='226'/><anchor id='Pg226'/>is no difficulty in finding several which could easily
pass the signal from Eleutheræ to Daphne, and
thence to Athens. We know that fire signals were
commonly used among the Greeks, and we can here
see an instance where news could be telegraphed
some thirty miles over a very difficult country in a
few moments. Meanwhile, as succors might be
some time in arriving, the fort was of such size and
strength as to hold a large garrison, and stop any
army which could not afford to mask it, by leaving
there a considerable force.<note place="foot">This the Peloponnesians did at Œnoe, according to Thucydides;
perhaps therefore at this very place.</note>
</p>

<p>
The site was, of course, an old one, and the name
Eleutheræ, if correctly applied to this fort, points
to a time when some mountain tribe maintained its
independence here against the governments on either
side in the plain, whence the place was called the
<q><hi rend='italic'>Free</hi></q> place, or <hi rend='italic'>Liberties</hi> (as we have the term in
Dublin). There is further evidence of this in a
small irregular fort which was erected almost in the
centre of the larger and later enclosure. This older
fort is of polygonal masonry, very inferior to the
other, and has fallen into ruins, while the later walls
and towers are in many places perfect. The outer
wall follows the nature of the position, the principle
being to find everywhere an abrupt descent from
the fortification, so that an assault must be very
difficult. On the north side, where the rock is
pre<pb n='227'/><anchor id='Pg227'/>cipitous, the wall runs along in a right line; whereas
on the south side, over the modern road, it dips
down the hill, and makes a semicircular sweep, so
as to crown the steepest part of a gentler ascent.
Thus the whole enclosure is of a half-moon shape.
But while the straight wall is almost intact, the
curved side has in many places fallen to pieces.
The building is the most perfect I have ever seen
of the kind, made of square hewn stones, evidently
quarried on the rock itself. The preserved wall is
about 200 yards long, six and a half feet wide, and
apparently not more than ten or twelve feet high;
but, at intervals of twenty-five or thirty yards, there
are seven towers twice as deep as the wall, while
the path along the battlement goes right through
them. Each tower has a doorway on the outside
of it, and close beside this there is also a doorway
in the wall, somewhat larger. These doorways,
made by a huge lintel, about seven and a half feet
long, laid over an aperture in the building, with its
edges very smoothly and carefully cut, are for the
most part absolutely perfect. As I could see no
sign of doorposts or bolts—a feature still noticeable
in all temple gates—it is evident that wooden doors
and door-posts were fitted into these doorways—a
dangerous form of defence, were not the entrances
strongly protected by the towers close beside them
and over them. There were staircases, leading from
the top of the wall outward, beside some of the
<pb n='228'/><anchor id='Pg228'/>towers. The whole fort is of such a size as to hold
not merely a garrison, but also the flocks and herds
of the neighboring shepherds, in case of a sudden
and dangerous invasion; and this, no doubt, was
the primary intention of all the older forts in Greece
and elsewhere.<note place="foot">There was no photograph of this very fine building existing
when I was in Greece. The only drawing of it I have seen is in
the plates of Dodwell’s <hi rend='italic'>Archæological Tour in Greece</hi>—a splendid
book. The fort of Phyle, though smaller, possesses all the features
described in this fort, and shows that they represent a general
type.</note>
</p>

<p>
The day was, as usual, very hot and fine, and the
hills were of that beautiful purple blue which Sir F.
Leighton so well reproduces in the backgrounds of
his Greek pictures; but a soft breeze brought occasional
clouds across the sun, and varied the landscape
with deeper hues. Above us on each side
were the noble crags of Cithæron, with their gray
rocks and their gnarled fir-trees. Far below, a
bright mountain stream was rushing beside the pass
into Attica; around us were the great walls of the
old Greeks, laid together with that symmetry, that
beauty, and that strength which marks all their
work. The massive towers are now defending a
barren rock; the enclosure which had seen so many
days of war and rapine was lying open and deserted;
the whole population was gone long centuries ago.
There is still <hi rend='italic'>liberty</hi> there, and there is peace—but
the liberty and the peace of solitude.
</p>

<pb n='229'/><anchor id='Pg229'/>

<p>
A short drive from Eleutheræ brought us to the
top of the pass,<note place="foot">This pass (seized by the Persian cavalry before the battle of
Platæa, in order to stop the Greek provision trains) was called
<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">τρεῖς κεφαλαί</foreign> by the Thebans, but
    <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">δρυὸς κεφ.</foreign> by the Athenians (Herod.
<hi rend='small'>IX.</hi> 39)—evidently the same old name diversely interpreted by
diverse <hi rend='italic'>Volks-etymologien</hi>.
    <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">τρεῖς</foreign> and <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">δρυός</foreign> are pronounced almost
alike in modern Greek, probably therefore in old Greek likewise.
But I will not touch the thorny question of old Greek pronunciation.</note> and we suddenly came upon one of
those views in Greece which, when we think of
them, leave us in doubt whether the instruction they
give us, or the delight, is the greater. The whole
plain of Thebes, and, beyond the intervening ridge,
the plain of Orchomenus, with its shining lake, were
spread out before us. The sites of all the famous
towns were easily recognizable. Platæa only was
straight beneath us, on the slopes of the mountain,
and as yet hidden by them. The plan of all Bœotia
unfolded itself with great distinctness—two considerable
plains, separated by a low ridge, and surrounded
on all sides by chains of mountains. On the north
there are the rocky hills which hem in Lake Copais
from the Eubœan strait, and which nature had
pierced before the days of history, aided by Minyan
engineers, whose <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">καταβόθρα</foreign>, as they were called,
were tunnelled drains, which drew water from thousands
of acres of the richest land. On the east,
where we stood, was the gloomy Cithæron—the
home of awful mythical crimes, and of wild
Bac<pb n='230'/><anchor id='Pg230'/>chanalian orgies, the theme of many a splendid
poem and many a striking tragedy. To the south
lay the pointed peaks of Helicon—a mountain (or
mountain chain) full of sweetness and light, with
many silver streams coursing down its sides to water
the Bœotian plains, and with its dells, the home of
the Muses ever since they inspired the bard of Ascra—the
home, too, of Eros, who long after the reality
of the faith had decayed, was honored in Thespiæ
by the crowds of visitors who went up to see the
famous statue of the god by Praxiteles. This
Helicon separates Bœotia from the southern sea,
but does not close up completely with Cithæron,
leaving way for an army coming from the isthmus,
where Leuctra stood to guard the entrance. Over
against us, on the west, lay, piled against one
another, the dark wild mountains of Phocis, with
the giant Parnassus raising its snow-clad shoulders
above the rest. But, in the far distance, the snowy
Corax of Ætolia stood out in rivalry, and showed
us that Parnassus is but the advanced guard of the
wild alpine country, which even in Greece proved
too rugged a nurse for culture.
</p>

<p>
We made our descent at full gallop down the
windings of the road—a most risky drive; but the
coachman was daring and impatient, and we felt, in
spite of the danger, that peculiar delight which
accompanies the excitement of going at headlong
pace. We had previously an even more perilous
<pb n='231'/><anchor id='Pg231'/>experience in coming down the steep and tortuous
descent from the Laurium mines to Ergasteria in
the train, where the sharp turns were apparently
full of serious risk. Above our heads were wheeling
great vultures—huge birds, almost black, with
lean, featherless heads—which added to the wildness
of the scene. After this rapid journey we came
upon the site of Platæa, marked by a modern village
of the name, on our left, and below us we saw the
winding Asopus, and the great scene of one of the
most famous of all Greek battles—the battle of
Platæa. This little town is situated much higher
up the mountain than I had thought, and a glance
showed us its invaluable position as an outpost of
Athenian power toward Bœotia. With the top of
the pass within an hour’s walk, the Platæans could,
from their streets, see every movement over the
Theban plain: they could see an invasion from the
south coming up by Leuctra; they could see troops
marching northward toward Tanagra and Œnophyta.
They could even see into the Theban Cadmea, which
lay far below them, and then telegraph from the top
of the pass to Eleutheræ, and from thence to Athens.
We can, therefore, understand at once Platæa’s
importance to Athens, and why the Athenians built
a strong fortified post on their very frontier, within
easy reach of it.
</p>

<p>
All the site of the great battle is well marked and
well known—the fountain Gargaphia, the so-called
<pb n='232'/><anchor id='Pg232'/>island, and the Asopus, flowing lazily in a deep-cut
sedgy channel, in most places far too deep to ford.
Over our heads were still circling the great black
vultures; but, as we neared the plain, we flashed
a large black-and-white eagle, which we had not
seen in Attica. There is some cultivation between
Platæa and Thebes, but strangely alternating with
wilderness. We were told that the people have
plenty of spare land, and, not caring to labor for
its artificial improvement, till a piece of ground
once, and then let it lie fallow for a season or two.
The natural richness of the Bœotian soil thus supplies
them with ample crops. But we wondered to
think how impossible it seems even in these rich and
favored plains to induce a fuller population.
</p>

<p>
The question of the depopulation of Greece is
no new one—it is not due to the Slav inroads—it is
not due to Turkish misrule. As soon as the political
liberties of Greece vanished, so that the national
talent found no scope in local government—as soon
as the riches of Asia were opened to Greek enterprise—the
population diminished with wonderful
rapidity. All the later Greek historians and travellers
are agreed about the fact.<note place="foot">Cf. what I have said in relation to Polybius’s account of it in
my <hi rend='italic'>Greek Life and Thought</hi>, pp. 534 <hi rend='italic'>sq.</hi></note> <q>The whole of
Greece could not put in the field,</q> says one, <q>as
many soldiers as came of old from a single city.</q>
<q>Of all the famous cities of Bœotia,</q> says another,
<pb n='233'/><anchor id='Pg233'/><q>but two—Thespiæ and Tanagra—now remain.</q>
The rest are mostly described as ruins (<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἐρείπια</foreign>).
No doubt, every young enterprising fellow went off
to Asia as a soldier or a merchant; and this taste for
emigrating has remained strong in the race till the
present day, when most of the business of Constantinople,
of Smyrna, and of Alexandria is in the hands
of Greeks. But, in addition to this, the race itself
seems at a certain period to have become less prolific;
and this, too, is a remarkable feature lasting to
our own time. In the several hospitable houses in
which I was entertained through the country I
sought in vain for children. The young married
ladies had their mothers to keep them company, and
this was a common habit; the daughter does not
willingly separate from her mother. But, whether
by curious coincidence or not, the absence of children
in these seven or eight houses was very remarkable.
I have been since assured that this was an
accident, and that large families are very common in
Greece. The statistics show a considerable increase
of population of late years.<note place="foot">Cf., for example, the figures in the recent (1891) <hi rend='italic'>Guide
Joanne</hi>, ii. xxxvi.</note>
</p>

<p>
The evening saw us entering into Thebes—the
town which, beyond all others, retains the smallest
vestiges of antiquity. Even the site of the Cadmea
is not easily distinguishable. Two or three hillocks
in and about the town are all equally insignificant,
<pb n='234'/><anchor id='Pg234'/>and all equally suitable, one should think, for a fortress.
The discovery of the old foundations of the
walls has, however, determined the matter, and
settled the site to be that of the highest part of the
present town. Its strength, which was celebrated,
must have been due nearly altogether to artificial
fortification, for though the old city was in a deeper
valley to the north-west, yet from the other side
there can never have been any ascent steep enough
to be a natural rampart. The old city was, no
doubt, always more renowned for eating and drinking
than for art or architecture,<note place="foot">There was, indeed, a splendid <hi rend='italic'>pleasaunce</hi> built at Thebes by
the Frankish knights, which was completely destroyed by the
grand Catalan company. It is described by their annalist Ramon
Muntaner. The remains of one Frankish tower mark the place.</note> and its momentary
supremacy under Epaminondas was too busy and too
short a season to be employed in such pursuits. But,
besides all this, and besides all the ruin of Alexander’s
fury, the place has been visited several times
with the most destructive earthquakes, from the last
of which (in 1852) it had not recovered when I first
saw it. There were still through the streets houses
torn open, and walls shaken down; there were gaps
made by ruins, and half-restored shops.
</p>

<p>
The antiquities of Thebes consist of a few inscribed
slabs and fragments which are (as usual) collected
in a dark outhouse, where it is not easy to
make them out. I was not at the trouble of reading
<pb n='235'/><anchor id='Pg235'/>these inscriptions, for in this department the antiquarians
of the University of Athens are really very
zealous and competent, and I doubt whether any inscription
now discovered fails to come into the Greek
papers within a few months. From these they of
course pass into the <hi rend='italic'>Corpus Inscriptionum Græcarum</hi>,
a collection daily increasing, and periodically reedited.
I may observe that, not only for manners
and customs, but even for history, these undeniable
and seldom suspicious sources are rapidly becoming
our surest and even fullest authority.
</p>

<p>
In the opinion of the inhabitants, by far the most
important thing about the town is the tomb of their
Evangelist S. Luke, which is situated in a chapel
close by. The stone is polished and worn with the
feet and lips of pilgrims, and all such homes of long
devotion are in themselves interesting; but the visitor
may well wonder that the Evangelist should
have his tomb established in a place so absolutely
decayed and depopulated as was the region of Thebes,
even in his day. The tombs of the early preachers
and missionaries are more likely to be in the thickest
of thoroughfares, amid the noise and strife of
men. The Evangelist was confused with a later
local saint of the same name.<note place="foot">See his life in Gregorovius’s <hi rend='italic'>Athen</hi>, vol. i. pp. 144 <hi rend='italic'>sq.</hi></note>
</p>

<p>
Thebes is remarkable for its excellent supply of
water. Apart from the fountain Dirke,<note place="foot">The legend of the name is now fully explained in the
    fragments of the <hi rend='italic'>Antiope</hi> published by me in the <hi rend='italic'>Petrie papyri</hi> (Williams
&amp; Norgate, 1891).</note> several
<pb n='236'/><anchor id='Pg236'/>other great springs rise in the higher ground close to
it, and are led by old Greek conduits of marble to
the town. One of these springs was large enough
to allow us to bathe—a most refreshing change after
the long and hot carriage drive, especially in the ice-cold
water, as it came from its deep hiding-place.
We returned at eight in the evening to dine with our
excellent host—a host provided for us by telegraph
from Athens—where we had ample opportunity
of noticing some of the peculiarities of modern
Greek life.
</p>

<p>
The general elections were at the moment pending.
M. Boulgaris had just <hi rend='italic'>échoue</hi>, as the French
say; and the King, after a crisis in which a rupture
of the Constitution had been expected, decided to
try a constitutional experiment, and called to office
M. Trikoupi, an advanced Radical in those days,
and strongly opposed to the Government. But M.
Trikoupi was a highly educated and reasonable man,
well acquainted with England and English politics,
and apparently anxious to govern by strictly constitutional
means. He has since proved himself, by his
able and vigorous administration, one of the most
remarkable statesmen in Europe, and the main cause
of the progress of his country. His recent defeat
(1890) is therefore to be regarded as a national misfortune.
Our new friend at Thebes was then the
<pb n='237'/><anchor id='Pg237'/>Radical candidate, and was at the very time of our
arrival canvassing his constituency. Every idle fellow
in the town seemed to think it his duty to come
up into his drawing-room, in which we were resting,
and sit down to encourage him and advise him. No
hint that he was engaged in entertaining strangers
had the smallest effect: noisy politics was inflicted
upon us till the welcome announcement of dinner, to
which, for a wonder, his constituents did not follow him.
He told me that though all the country was strongly
in favor of M. Trikoupi, yet he could hardly count
upon a majority with certainty, for he had determined
to let the elections follow their own course,
and not control them with soldiers. In this most
constitutional country, with its freedom, as usual,
closely imitated from England, soldiers stood, at
least up to the summer of 1875, round the booths,
and hustled out any one who did not come to vote
for the Ministerial candidate. M. Trikoupi refused
to take this traditional precaution, and, as the result
showed, lost his sure majority.
</p>

<p>
But when I was there, and before the actual elections
had taken place, the Radical party were very
confident. They were not only to come in triumphant,
but their first act was to be the prosecution of
the late Prime Minister, M. Boulgaris, for violating
the Constitution, and his condemnation to hard labor,
with confiscation of his property. I used to plead
the poor man’s case earnestly with these hot-headed
<pb n='238'/><anchor id='Pg238'/>politicians, by way of amusement, and was highly
edified by their arguments. The ladies, as usual,
were by far the fiercest, and were ready, like their
goddess of old, to eat the raw flesh of their enemies.
I used to ask them whether it would not be quite
out of taste if Mr. Disraeli, then in power, were to
prosecute Mr. Gladstone for violating the Constitution
in his Irish Church Act, and have him condemned
to hard labor. The cases, they replied,
were quite different. No Englishman could ever
attain, or even understand, the rascality of the late
Greek Minister. Feeling that there might be some
force in this argument, I changed ground, and asked
them were they not afraid that if he were persecuted
in so violent a way he might, instead of occupying
the Opposition benches, betake himself to occupy
the mountain passes, and, by robbing a few English
travellers, so discredit the new Government as to be
worse and more dangerous in opposition than in
power. No, they said, he will not do that; he is
<hi rend='italic'>too rich</hi>. But, said I, if you confiscate his property,
he will be poor. True, they replied; but still he
will not be able to do it: he is <hi rend='italic'>too old</hi>. It seemed
as if the idea that he might be too respectable never
crossed their minds.<note place="foot">I trust none will imagine that I intend the least disrespect to
M. Boulgaris, who was, according to far better authority than that
quoted in the text, an honorable and estimable man. But some of
his Ministers have been since convicted of malpractices concerning
certain archbishoprics, which were bought for money. The trial is
now a matter of history, to which an allusion is sufficient.</note> What was my surprise to
<pb n='239'/><anchor id='Pg239'/>hear within six months that this dreadful culprit had
come into power again at the head of a considerable
majority!
</p>

<p>
We were afterward informed by a sarcastic observer
that many of the Greek politicians are
paupers, <q>who will not dig, and to beg they are
ashamed;</q> and so they sit about the <hi rend='italic'>cafés</hi> of Athens
on the look-out for one of the 10,000 places which
have been devised for the patronage of the Ministry.
But, as there are some 30,000 expectants, it follows
that the 20,000 disappointed are always at work seeking
to turn out the 10,000. Hence a crisis every
three months; hence a Greek ambassador could
hardly reach his destination before he was recalled;
hence, too, the exodus of all thrifty and hard-working
men to Smyrna, to Alexandria, or to Manchester,
where their energies were not wasted in perpetual
political squabbling. The greatest misconduct with
which a man in office could be charged was the holding
of it for any length of time; the whole public then
join against him, and cry out that it is high time for
him, after so long an innings, to make way for some
one else. It was not till M. Trikoupi established his
ascendency that this ridiculous condition of things
ceased. Whether in office or in opposition, he has a
policy, and retains the confidence of foreign powers.
I had added, in the first edition of this book, some
<pb n='240'/><anchor id='Pg240'/>further observations on the apparent absurdity of
introducing the British Constitution, or some parody
of it, into every new state which is rescued from
barbarism or from despotism. I am not the least disposed
to retract what I then said generally, but it is
common justice to the Greeks to say that later events
are showing them to be among the few nations
where such an experiment may succeed. When the
dangerous crisis of the Turco-Russian war supervened,
instead of rushing to arms, as they were
advised by some fanatical English politicians, they
set about to reform their Ministry; and, feeling the
danger of perpetually changing the men at the helm,
they insisted on the heads of the four principal
parties forming a coalition, under the nominal leadership
of M. Canaris.<note place="foot">Since that time, the chief power has for the most part been in
the hands of M. Trikoupi, an honest patriot. Yet it was the misfortune
of the country to be reduced by M. Delyanni to the verge
of bankruptcy through his absurd war policy against Turkey. It
is probable enough that he did not lead, but was carried along by
this policy, with which all the Athenian <q>Jingoes</q> were possessed.</note> This great political move, one
of the most remarkable of our day, was attempted,
as far as I can make out, owing to the deliberate
pressure of the country, and from a solid interest in
its welfare. Even though temporary in the present
case, it was an earnest that the Greeks are learning
national politics, and that a liberal constitution is not
wasted upon them. There are many far more developed
and important nations in Europe which
<pb n='241'/><anchor id='Pg241'/>would not be capable of such a sacrifice of party
interests and party ambition.
</p>

<p>
We left Thebes, very glad that we had seen it,
but not very curious to see it again. Its site makes
it obviously the natural capital of the rich plain
around it; and we can also see at once how the
larger and richer plain of Orchomenus is separated
from it by a distinct saddle of rising ground, and
was naturally, in old times, the seat of a separate
power. But the separation between the two districts,
which is not even so steep or well marked as
the easy pass of Daphne between Athens and Eleusis,
makes it also clear that the owners of either
plain would certainly cast the eye of desire upon the
possessions of their neighbors, and so at an early
epoch Orchomenus was subdued. For many reasons
this may have been a disaster to Greece. The
Minyæ of Orchomenus, as people called the old
nobles who settled there in prehistoric days, were
a great and rich society, building forts and treasure-houses,
and celebrated, even in Homer’s day, for
wealth and splendor.
</p>

<p>
But, perhaps owing to this very luxury, they were
subdued by the inartistic, vulgar Thebans, who, during
centuries of power and importance, never rose to
greatness save through the transcendent genius of
Pindar and of Epaminondas. No real greatness
ever attached to their town. When people came
from a distance to see art in Bœotia, they came to
<pb n='242'/><anchor id='Pg242'/>little Thespiæ, in the southern hills, where the Eros
of Praxiteles was the pride of the citizens. Tanagra,
too, in the terra cottas of which I have spoken (above,
<ref target="Pg059">p. 59</ref>), shows taste and refinement; and we still look
with sympathy upon the strangely modern fashions
of these graceful and elegant figures. At Thebes,
so far as I know, no trace of fine arts has yet been
discovered. The great substructure of the Cadmea,
the solid marble water-pipes of their conduits, a few
inscriptions—that is all. It corroborates what we
find in the middle and new comedy of the Greeks,
that Thebes was a place for eating and drinking, a
place for other coarse material comforts—but no
place for real culture or for art. Even their great
poet, Pindar, a poet in whom most critics find all
the highest qualities of genius—loftiness, daring,
originality—even this great man—no doubt from
the accidents of his age—worked by the job, and
bargained for the payment of his noblest odes.
</p>

<p>
Thus, even in Pindar, there is something to remind
us of his Theban vulgarity; and it is, therefore,
all the more wonderful, and all the more freely
to be confessed, that in Epaminondas we find not a
single flaw or failing, and that he stands out as far
the noblest of all the great men whom Greece ever
produced. It were possible to maintain that he was
also the greatest, but this is a matter of opinion and
of argument. Certain it is that his influence made
Thebes, for the moment, not only the leader in Greek
<pb n='243'/><anchor id='Pg243'/>politics, but the leader in Greek society. Those of
his friends whom we know seem not only patriots,
but gentlemen—they cultivated with him music and
eloquence, nor did they despise philosophy. So
true is it, that in this wonderful peninsula genius
seemed possible everywhere, and that from the
least cultivated and most vulgar town might arise
a man to make all the world about him admire and
tremble.
</p>

<p>
I will make but one more remark about this plain
of Bœotia. There is no part of Greece so sadly
famed for all the battles with which its soil was
stained. The ancients called it Mars’s <hi rend='italic'>Orchestra</hi>, or
exercising ground; and even now, when all the old
life is gone, and when not a hovel remains to mark
the site of once well-built towns, we may indeed ask,
why were these towns celebrated? Simply because
in old Greek history their names served to specify
a scene of slaughter, where a campaign, or it may
be an empire, was lost or won, Platæa, Leuctra,
Haliartus, Coronea, Chæronea, Delium, Œnophyta,
Tanagra—these are in history the landmarks of battles,
and, with one exception, landmarks of nothing
more. Thebes is mainly the nurse of the warriors
who fought in these battles, and but little else. So,
then, we cannot compare Bœotia to the rich plains
of Lombardy—they, too, in their clay, ay, and in
our own day, Mars’s Orchestra—for here literature
and art have given fame to cities, while the battles
<pb n='244'/><anchor id='Pg244'/>fought around their walls have been forgotten by the
world.
</p>

<p>
I confess we saw nothing of the foggy atmosphere
so often brought up against the climate of Bœotia.
And yet it was then, of course, more foggy than it
had been of old, for then the lake Copais was
drained, whereas in 1875 the old tunnels, cut, or
rather enlarged, by the Minyæ, were choked, and
thousands of acres of the richest land covered with
marsh and lake. It was M. Trikoupi who promoted
the plan of a French Company to drain the
lake more completely than even the old <hi rend='italic'>Catabothra</hi>
had done, and, at the cost of less than one million
sterling, to bring into permanent cultivation some
thousands of acres—in fact, the largest and richest
plain in all Greece. I asked him where he meant
to find a population to till it, seeing that the present
land was about ten times more than sufficient for the
inhabitants. He told me that some Greek colonists,
who had settled in the north, under the Turks or
Servians (I forget which), were desirous of returning
to enjoy the sweets of Hellenic liberty. It was proposed
to give them the reclaimed tract. If these
good people will reason from analogy, they will be
slow to trust their fortunes to their old fellow-countrymen.
So long as they are indigent they will be
unmolested—<hi rend='italic'>cantabit vacuus coram latrone viator</hi>—but
as soon as they prosper, or are supposed to prosper,
we might have the affair of Laurium repeated.
<pb n='245'/><anchor id='Pg245'/>The natives might be up in arms against the strangers
who had come to plunder the land of the wealth
intended by nature for others. The Greek Parliament
might be persuaded to make retrospective laws
and restrictions, and probably all the more active
and impatient spirits would leave a country where
prosperity implied persecution, and where people
only awake to the value of their possessions after
they have sold them to others.
</p>

<p>
What is now happening illustrates the views which
I long since proposed. When the drainage works,
completed in 1887, had uncovered rich tracts, the
Government laid claim to every acre of it, and endeavored
to fence off the old riparian proprietors.
They on their side disputed the new boundaries,
and claimed what the Government professed to
have uncovered. Hence no sale to new owners
is as yet possible. The dispute is still (1891) unsettled.
</p>

<p>
I think jealousy no accidental feature, but one
specially engrained in the texture of Greek nature
from the earliest times. Nothing can be a more
striking or cogent proof of this than the way in
which Herodotus sets down jealousy as one of the
attributes of the Deity. For the Deities of all
nations being conceptions formed after the analogy
of human nature around them, there can be no
doubt that the honest historian put it down as a
necessary factor in the course and constitution of
<pb n='246'/><anchor id='Pg246'/>nature. We can only understand Greek history
by keeping these things perpetually in mind, and
even now it explains the apparent anomaly, how a
nation so essentially democratic—who recognize no
nobility and no distinctions of rank—can be satisfied
with a king of foreign race. They told me themselves,
over and over again, that the simple reason
was this: no Greek could tolerate another set over
him, so that even such an office as President of a
Greek Republic would be intolerable, if held by one
of themselves. And this same feeling in old times
is the real reason of the deadly hate manifested
against the most moderate and humane despots.
However able, however kindly, however great such
a despot might be; however the state might prosper
under him, one thing in him was intolerable—he had
no natural right to be superior to his fellows, and
yet he was superior. I will not deny the existence
of political enthusiasm, and of real patriotism among
Greek tyrannicides, but I am quite sure that the
universal sympathy of the nation with them was
partly based upon this deep-seated feeling.
</p>

<p>
It is said that, in another curious respect, the old
and modern Greeks are very similar—I mean the
form which bribery takes in their political struggles.
It has been already observed and discussed by Mr.
Freeman, how, among the old Greeks, it was the
politician who was bribed, and not the constituents;
whereas among us in England the leading politicians
<pb n='247'/><anchor id='Pg247'/>are above suspicion, while the constituents are often
corruptible enough. Our Theban friend told me
that in modern Greece the ancient form of bribery
was still in fashion; and that, except in Hydra and
one other place—probably, if I remember rightly,
Athens—the bribing of constituents was unknown;
while the taking of bribes by Ministers was alleged
not to be very uncommon. A few years ago, men
of sufficient importance to be Cabinet Ministers
were openly brought into court, and indicted for the
sale of three archbishoprics, those of Patras and
Corinth among the number. There is no doubt that
this public charge points to a sort of bribery likely
to take place in any real democracy, when the
men at the head of affairs are not men of great
wealth and noble birth, but often ordinary, or even
needy persons, selected by ballot, or popular vote,
to fill for a very short time a very influential office.

<head type="sub">THE PLAIN OF ORCHOMENUS, LIVÁDIA, CHÆRONEA.</head>

<p>
The road from Thebes to Lebadea (Livádia) leads
along the foot of Helicon all the way—Helicon,
which, like all celebrated Greek mountains, is not a
summit, but a system of summits, or even a chain.
Looking in the morning from the plain, the contrast
of the dark Cithæron and the gentle sunny Helicon
strikes the traveller again and again. After the
ridge, or saddle, is passed which separates the plain
of Thebes from that of Orchomenus, the richness of
the soil increases, but the land becomes very swampy
and low, for at every half-mile comes a clear silver
river, tumbling from the slopes of Helicon on our
left, crossing the road, and flowing to swell the
waters of Lake Copais—a vast sheet with undefined
edges, half-marsh, half-lake—which for centuries
had no outlet to the sea, and which was only kept
from covering all the plain by evaporation in the
heats of summer. Great fields of sedge and rushes,
giant reeds, and marsh plants unknown in colder
countries, mark each river course as it nears the
lake; and, as might be expected in this lonely fen
country, all manner of insect life and all manner of
<pb n='249'/><anchor id='Pg249'/>amphibia haunt the sites of ancient culture. Innumerable
dragon-flies, of the most brilliant colors,
were flitting about the reeds, and lighting on the
rich blades of grass which lay on the water’s surface;
and now and then a daring frog would charge
boldly at so great a prize, but retire again in fear
when the fierce insect dashed against him in its impetuous
start. Large land tortoises, with their
high-arched shells, yellow and brown, and patterned
like the section of a great honeycomb, went lazily
along the moist banks, and close by the water, which
they could not bear to touch. Their aquatic
cousins, on the other hand, were not solitary in
habit, but lay in lines along the sun-baked mud, and
at the first approach of danger dropped into the
water one after the other with successive flops, looking
for all the world a long row of smooth black
pebbles which had suddenly come to life, like old
Deucalion’s clods, that they might people this solitude.
The sleepy and unmeaning faces of these
tortoises were a great contrast to those of the water-snakes,
which were very like them in form, but
wonderfully keen and lively in expression. They,
too, would glide into the water when so strange a
thing as man came near, but would presently raise
their heads above the surface, and eye with wonder
and suspicion, and in perfect stillness, the approach
of their natural enemy. The Copaic eels, so celebrated
in the Attic comedy as the greatest of all
<pb n='250'/><anchor id='Pg250'/>dainties, are also still to be caught; but the bright
sun and cloudless sky made vain all my attempts to
lure this famous darling of Greek epicures. We
noticed that while the shrill cicada, which frequents
dry places, was not common here, great emerald-green
grasshoppers were flying about spasmodically,
with a sound and weight like that of a small bird.
</p>

<p>
As we passed along, we were shown the sites of
Haliartus and Coronea—Haliartus, where the cruel
Lysander met his death in a skirmish, and so gave a
place in history to an obscure village—Coronea,
where the Spartans first learned to taste the temper
of the Theban infantry, and where King Agesilaus
well-nigh preceded his great rival to the funeral
pyre. As I said before, all these towns are only
known by battles. Thespiæ has an independent interest,
and so has Ascra. The latter was the residence
of the earliest known Greek poet of whose
personality we can be sure; Thespiæ, with its
highly aristocratic society, which would not let a
shopkeeper walk their place of assembly for ten
years after he had retired from business, was the site
of fair temples and statues, and held its place and
fame long after all the rest of the surrounding cities
had sunk into decay. There are indistinct remains
of surrounding walls about both Haliartus and Coronea,
but surely nothing that would repay the labor
of excavations. All these Bœotian towns were, of
course, fortified, and all of them lay close to the
<pb n='251'/><anchor id='Pg251'/>hills; for the swampy plain was unhealthy, and in
older days the rising lake was said to have swallowed
up towns which had been built close upon its
margin. But the supremacy of Orchomenus in
older, and Thebes in later days, never allowed these
subject towns to attain any importance or any political
significance.
</p>

<p>
After some hours’ riding, we suddenly came upon
a deep vista in the mountains on our left—such
another vista as there is behind Coronea, but narrower,
and inclosed on both sides with great and
steep mountains. And here we found the cause of
the cultivation of the upper plain—here was the
town of Lebadea (Livádia), famed of old for the
august oracle of Trophonius—in later days the
Turkish capital of the province surrounding. To
this the roads of all the neighborhood converge,
and from this a small force can easily command the
deep gorges and high mountain passes which lead
through Delphi to the port of Kirrha. Even now
there is more life in Livádia than in most Greek
towns. All the wool of the country is brought in
and sold there, and, with the aid of their great
water power, they have a considerable factory,
where the wool is spun and woven into stuff. A
large and beautifully clear river comes down the
gorge above the town—or rather the gorge in which
the town lies—and tumbles in great falls between the
streets and under the houses, which have wooden
<pb n='252'/><anchor id='Pg252'/>balconies, like Swiss châlets, built over the stream.
The whole aspect of the town was not unlike a Swiss
town; indeed, all the features of the upland country
are ever reminding the traveller of his Swiss experience.
</p>

<p>
But the people are widely different. It was a
great saint’s day, and all the streets were crowded
with people from many miles round. As we noted in
all Greek towns, except Arachova, the women were
not to be seen in any numbers. They do not walk
about the streets except for some special ceremony
or amusement. But no women’s costume is required
to lend brightness to the coloring of the scene; for
here every man had his <hi rend='italic'>fustanella</hi> or kilt of dazzling
white, his gray or puce embroidered waistcoat, his
great white sleeves, and his scarlet skull-cap, with
its blue tassel. Nothing can be imagined brighter
than a dense crowd in this dress. They were all
much excited at the arrival of strangers, and
crowded around us without the least idea or care
about being thought obtrusive. The simple Greek
peasant thinks it his right to make aloud what observations
he chooses upon any stranger, and has
not the smallest idea of the politeness of reticence
on such occasions.
</p>

<p>
We were received most hospitably by the medical
officer of the district, who had an amiable young
wife, speaking Greek only, and a lively old mother-in-law,
living, as usual, permanently in the house,
<pb n='253'/><anchor id='Pg253'/>to prevent the young lady from being lonely. Like
all the richer Greeks in country parts, they ate
nothing till twelve, when they had a sort of early
dinner called breakfast, and then dined again at
half-past eight in the evening. This arrangement
gave us more than enough time to look about the
town when our day’s ride was over; so we went,
first of all, to see the site of Trophonius’s oracle.
</p>

<p>
As the gorge becomes narrower, there is, on the
right side, a small cave, from which a sacred stream
flows to join the larger river. Here numerous square
panels cut into the rock to hold votive tablets, now
gone, indicate a sacred place, to which pilgrims came
to offer prayers for aid, and thanksgiving for success.
The actual seat of the oracle is not certain, and is
supposed to be some cave or aperture now covered
by the Turkish fort on the rock immediately above;
but the whole glen, with its beetling sides, its rushing
river, and its cavernous vaulting, seems the very
home and preserve of superstition. We followed
the windings of the defile, jumping from rock to
rock up the river bed, and were soon able to bathe
beyond the observation of all the crowding boys,
who, like the boys of any other town, could not
satisfy their curiosity at strangeness of face and
costume. As we went on for some miles, the
country began to open, and to show us a bleak and
solitary mountain region, where the chains of Helicon
and Parnassus join, and shut out the sea of
<pb n='254'/><anchor id='Pg254'/>Corinth from Bœotia by a great bar some thirty
miles wide. Not a sound could be heard in this
wild loneliness, save the metallic pipe of a water
ouzel by the river, and the scream of hawks about
their nests, far up on the face of the cliffs.
</p>

<p>
As the evening was closing in we began to retrace
our steps, when we saw in two or three places scarlet
caps over the rocks, and swarthy faces peering down
upon us with signs and shouts. Though nothing
could have been more suspicious in such a country,
I cannot say that we felt the least uneasiness, and
we continued our way without regarding them.
They kept watching us from the heights, and when
at last we descended nearer to the town, they came
and made signs, and spoke very new Greek, to the
effect that they had been out scouring the country
for us, and that they had been very uneasy about
our safety. This was indeed the case; our excellent
Greek companion, who felt responsible to the Greek
Government for our safety, and who had stayed behind
in Livádia to make arrangements, had become
so uneasy that he had sent out the police to scour
the country. So we were brought in with triumph
by a large escort of idlers and officials, and presently
sat down to dinner at the fashionable hour, though in
anything but fashionable dress. The entertainment
would have been as excellent as even the intentions
of our host, had not our attention been foolishly distracted
by bugs walking up the table-cloth. It is,
<pb n='255'/><anchor id='Pg255'/>indeed, but a small and ignoble insect, yet it produces
a wonderful effect upon the mind; for it
inspires the most ordinary man with the gift of
prophecy: it carries him away even from the
pleasures of a fair repast into the hours of night
and mystery, when all his wisdom and all his might
will not save him from the persistent skirmishing
of his irreconcilable foe.
</p>

<p>
It may be here worth giving a word of encouragement
to the sensitive student whom these hints are
apt to deter from venturing into the wilds of Greece.
In spite of frequent starvation, both for want of food
and for want of eatable food; in spite of frequent
sleeplessness and even severe exercise at night, owing
to the excess of insect population;<note place="foot">This plague seems unavoidable in a southern climate, wherever
the houses, however good, are built of wood, and does not imply
any ungrateful reflection upon my refined and generous hosts. In
the Morea, where houses are built of masonry, even badly-kept
houses are comparatively safe.</note> such is the lightness
and clearness of the air, such the exhilarating
effect of great natural beauty, and of solitary wandering,
free and unshackled, across the wild tracts of
valley, wood, and mountain, that fatigue is an almost
impossible feeling. Eight or ten hours’ riding every
day, which in other country and other air would
have been almost unendurable, was here but the
natural exercise which any ordinary man may conveniently
take. It cannot be denied that the
dis<pb n='256'/><anchor id='Pg256'/>comforts of Greek travelling are very great, but
with good temper and patience they can all be
borne; and when they are over they form a pleasant
feature in the recollections of a glorious time. Besides,
these discomforts are only the really classical
mode of travelling. Dionysus, in Aristophanes’s
<hi rend='italic'>Frogs</hi>, asks, especially about the inns, the very
questions which we often put to our guide; and if
his slave carried for him not only ordinary baggage,
but also his bed and bedding, so nowadays there
are many khans (inns) where the traveller cannot lie
down—I was going to say to rest—except on his
own rugs.
</p>

<p>
The next day was occupied in a tour across the
plain to Orchomenus, then to Chæronea, and back
to Livádia in the evening, so as to start from thence
for the passes to Delphi. Our ride was, as it were,
round an isosceles triangle, beginning with the right
base angle, going to Orchomenus north-east as the
vertex, then to Chæronea at the left base angle, and
home again over the high spurs of mountain which
protrude into the plain between the two base angles
of our triangle. For about a mile, as we rode out
of Livádia, a wretched road of little rough paving-stones
tormented us—the remains of Turkish engineering,
when Livádia was their capital. Patches
of this work are still to be found in curious isolation
over the mountains, to the great distress of both
mules and riders; for the stones are very small and
<pb n='257'/><anchor id='Pg257'/>pointed, or, where they have been worn smooth,
exceedingly slippery. But we soon got away into
deep rich meadows upon the low level of the country
adjoining the lake, where we found again the same
infinitely various insect life which I have already
described. A bright merry Greek boy, in full dress
(for it was again a holiday), followed in attendance
on each mule or pony, and nothing could be more
picturesque than the cavalcade, going in Indian file
through the long grass, among the gay wild flowers,
especially when some creek or rivulet made our
course to wind about, and so brought the long line
of figures into more varied grouping. As for the
weather, it was so uniformly splendid that we almost
forgot to notice it. Indeed, strangers justly remark
what large conversation it affords us in Ireland, for
there it is a matter of constant uncertainty, and requires
forethought and conjecture. During my first
journey in Greece, in the months of April, May, and
June, there was nothing to be said, except that we
saw one heavy shower at Athens, and two hours’
rain in Arcadia, and that the temperature was not
excessively hot. I have had similar experiences in
March and April during three other sojourns in the
country.
</p>

<p>
In two or three hours we arrived at the site of
old Orchomenus, of late called Scripou, but now
reverting, like all Greek towns, to its original name.
There is a mere hamlet, some dozen houses, at the
<pb n='258'/><anchor id='Pg258'/>place, which is close to the stone bridge built over
the Kephissus—the Bœotian Kephissus—at this
place. This river appears to be the main feeder
of the Copaic lake, coming down, as we saw it,
muddy and cold with snow-water from the heights
of Parnassus. It runs very rapidly, like the Iser at
Munich, and is at Orchomenus about double the size
of that river. Of the so-called treasure-house of
the Minyæ, nothing remains but the stone doorposts
and the huge block lying across them; and even
these are almost imbedded in earth. It was the
most disappointing ruin I had seen in Greece, for it
is always quoted with the treasure-house of Atreus
at Mycenæ as one of the great specimens of prehistoric
building. It is not so interesting in any
sense as the corresponding raths in Ireland. Indeed,
but for Pausanias’s description, it would, I think,
have excited but little attention.
</p>

<p>
The subsequent excavation of it by Dr. Schliemann
yielded but poor results. The building had
fallen in but a few years ago. A handsome ceiling
pattern, to which a curious parallel was afterward
found at Tiryns, and some pottery, was all that
rewarded the explorer.
</p>

<p>
On the hill above are the well-preserved remains
of the small Acropolis, of which the stones are so
carefully cut that it looks at first sight modern, then
too good for modern work, but in no case polygonal,
as are the walls of the hill city which it protected.
<pb n='259'/><anchor id='Pg259'/>There is a remarkable tower built on the highest
point of the hill, with a very perfect staircase up to
it. The whole of the work is very like the work
of Eleutheræ, and seems to be of the best period of
Greek wall-building. Nothing surprises the traveller
in Greece more than the number of these splendid
hill-forts, or town-fortresses, which are never noticed
by the historians as anything remarkable—in fact,
the art and the habit of fortifying must have been
so universal that it excited no comment. This
strikes us all the more when so reticent a writer
as Thucydides, who seldom gives us anything but
war or politics, goes out of his way to describe the
wall-building of the Peiræus. He evidently contrasts
it with the hurried and irregular construction
of the city walls, into which even tombstones were
built; but if we did not study the remains still common
in Greece, we might imagine that the use of
square hewn stones, the absence of mortar and rubble,
and the clamping with lead and iron were exceptional,
whereas that sort of building is the most
usual sort in Greece. The walls of the Peiræus
cannot even have been the earliest specimen, for
the great portal at Mycenæ, though somewhat
rougher and more huge in execution, is on the
same principle. The only peculiarity of these walls
may have been their height and width, and upon
that point it is not easy to get any monumental evidence
now. The walls of the Peiræus have
disap<pb n='260'/><anchor id='Pg260'/>peared completely, though the foundations are still
traceable; others have stood, but perhaps on account
of their lesser height.
</p>

<p>
In a large and hospitable monastery we found the
well which Pausanias describes as close beside the
shrine of the Graces, and here we partook of breakfast,
attended by our muleteers, who always accompany
their employer into the reception-room of his
host, and look on at meat, ready to attend, and
always joining if possible in the conversation at
table. Some excellent specimens of old Greek pottery
were shown us in the monastery, apparently,
though not ostensibly, for sale, there being a law
prohibiting the sale of antiquities to foreigners, or
for exportation. In their chapel the monks pointed
out to us some fragments of marble pillars, and one
or two inscriptions—in which I was since informed
that I might have found a real live digamma, if I
had carefully examined them. The digamma is
now common enough at Olympia and elsewhere. I
saw it best, along with the <hi rend='italic'>koph</hi>, which is, I suppose,
much rarer, in the splendid bronze plates containing
Locrian inscriptions, which are in the possession of
Mr. Taylor’s heirs at Corfu. These plates have
been ably commented on, with facsimile drawings
of the inscriptions, by a Greek writer, G. N. <sic>Ecnomides</sic>
(Corfu, 1850, and Athens, 1869).
</p>

<p>
It was on our way up the valley to Chæronea,
along the rapid stream of the Kephissus, that we
<pb n='261'/><anchor id='Pg261'/>came, in a little deserted church, upon one of the
most remarkable extant specimens of a peculiar
epoch in Greek art. As usual, it was set up in the
dark, and we were repeatedly obliged to entreat the
natives to clear the door, through which alone we
could obtain any light to see the work. It is a funeral
<hi rend='italic'>stele</hi>, not unlike the celebrated <hi rend='italic'>stele</hi> and its relief
at Athens, which is inscribed as the <hi rend='italic'>stele</hi> of
Aristion, and dates from the time of the Persian
wars. The work before us was inscribed as the
work of Anxenor the Naxian—an artist otherwise
unknown to us; but the style and finish are very
remarkable, and more perfect than the <hi rend='italic'>stele</hi> of Aristion.
It is a relief carved on an upright slab of gray
Bœotian marble—I should say about four feet in
height—and representing a bearded man wrapped in
a cloak, resting on a long stick propped under his
arm,<note place="foot">Cf. Polygnotus’s picture of Agamemnon (Paus. x. 30, 3),
<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">σκήπτρῳ τε ὑπὸ τὴν ἀριστερὰν μασχάλην ἐρειδόμενος</foreign>.</note> with his legs awkwardly crossed, and offering
a large grasshopper to a dog sitting before him. The
hair and beard are conventionally curled, the whole
effect being very like an Assyrian relief; but this is
the case with all the older Greek sculpture, which
may have started in Ionia by an impulse from the far
east. The occurrence of the dog, a feature which
strikes us frequently in the later Attic tombs, supports
what I had long since inferred from stray hints
in Greek literature, that dogs among the old Greeks,
<pb n='262'/><anchor id='Pg262'/>as well as the modern, were held in the highest esteem
as the friends and companions of man. This
curious monument of early Greek art was lying hidden
in an obscure and out-of-the-way corner of Greece;
isolated, too, and with little of antiquarian interest in
its immediate neighborhood.<note place="foot">Since these words were written, M. Holleaux’s researches at
Akræphiæ have not only discovered the inscription containing the
Emperor Nero’s speech to the Greeks, but also many curious remains
from the temple of Apollo Ptoos.</note> On my second visit
(1884), I found a cast of it in the Ministry of Public
Instruction at Athens. On my third I found the
original removed to a prominent place in the National
Museum at Athens, where the traveller may
now study it at his ease.
</p>

<p>
The great value of these reliefs consists (apart
from their artistic value) in their undoubted genuineness.
For we know that in later days, both in
Greece and Italy, a sort of pre-Raphaelite taste
sprang up among amateurs, who admired and preferred
the stiff awkward groping after nature to the
symmetry and grace of perfect art. Pausanias, for
example, speaks with enthusiasm of these antique
statues and carvings, and generally mentions them
first, as of most importance. Thus, after describing
various archaic works on the Acropolis of Athens,
he adds, <q>But whoever places works made with
artistic skill before those which come under the designation
of archaic, may, if he likes, admire the
<pb n='263'/><anchor id='Pg263'/>following.</q><note place="foot"><foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ὅστις δὲ τὰ σὺν τέχνῃ πεποιημένα ἐπίπροσθε τίθεται τῶν
    ἀρχαιόητα ἡκώτων, καὶ τάδε ἐστιν οἱ θεάσασθαι.</foreign> I. 24. 3.</note> As a natural result, a fashion came in
of imitating them, and we have, especially in Italy,
many statues in this style which seem certainly to
be modern imitations, and not even Greek copies of
old Greek <anchor id="corr263"/><corr sic="originals">originals.</corr> But these imitations are so
well done, and so equalized by lapse of centuries
with the real antiques, that though there are scholars
who profess to distinguish infallibly the <hi rend='italic'>archaistic</hi>, as
they call it, from the archaic, it is sometimes a very
difficult task, and about many of them there is doubt
and debate.
</p>

<p>
But here at Orchomenus—a country which was so
decayed as to lose almost all its population two centuries
before Christ, where no amateurs of art would
stay, and where Plutarch was, as it were, the last
remains in his town of literature and respectability—here
there is no danger whatever of finding this
spurious work; and thus here, as indeed all through
Greece, archaic work is thoroughly trustworthy.
But the unfortunate law of the land not often violated,
as in this case—which insists upon all these
relics, however isolated, being kept in their place of
finding—is the mightiest obstacle to the study of
this interesting phase of culture, and we must await
the completion of the Hellenic Society’s gallery of
photographs, from which we can make reliable observations.
The Greeks will tell you that the
pres<pb n='264'/><anchor id='Pg264'/>ervation of antiquities in their original place, first of
all, gives the inhabitants an interest in them, which
might be true but that there are very often no inhabitants:
and next, that it encourages travelling in
the country. This also is true; but surely the making
of decent roads, and the establishing of decent
inns, and easy communications, would do infinitely
more, and are indeed necessary, before the second
stimulus can have its effect.
</p>

<p>
Not far from this little church and its famous relief,
we came in sight of the Acropolis (called Petrachus)
of Chæronea, and soon arrived at the town,
so celebrated through all antiquity, in spite of its
moderate size. The fort on the rock is, indeed,
very large—perhaps the largest we saw in Greece,
with the exception of that at Corinth; and, as usual
in these buildings, follows the steepest escarpments,
raising the natural precipice by a coping of beautifully
hewn and fitted square stones. The artificial
wall is now not more than four or five feet high; but
even so, there are only two or three places where it
is at all easy to enter the inclosure, which is fully a
mile of straggling outline on the rock. The view
from this fort is very interesting. Commanding all
the plain of the lake Copais, it also gives a view of
the sides of Parnassus, and of the passes into Phocis,
which cannot be seen till the traveller reaches this
point. Above all, it looks out upon the gap of
Elatea, about ten miles north-west, through which
<pb n='265'/><anchor id='Pg265'/>the eye catches glimpses of secluded valleys in
northern Phocis.
</p>

<p>
This gap is, indeed, the true key of this side of
Bœotia, and is no mere mountain pass, but a narrow
plain, perhaps a mile wide, which must have afforded
an easy transit for an army. But the mountains on
both sides are tolerably steep, and so it was necessary
to have a fortified town, as Elatea was, to keep the
command of the place. As we gazed through the
narrow plain, the famous passage of Demosthenes
came home to us, which begins: <q>It was evening,
and the news came in that Philip had seized, and
was fortifying Elatea.</q> The nearest point of observation
or of control was the rock of Chæronea,
and we may say with certainty that it was from here
the first breathless messenger set out with the terrible
news for Thebes and Athens. This, too, was evidently
the pass through which Agesilaus came on
his return from Asia, and on his way to Coronea,
where his great battle was fought, close by the older
trophy of the Theban victory over Tolmides.<note place="foot">Cf. Plut. <hi rend='italic'>Agesilaus</hi>, chap. xvii.</note>
</p>

<p>
Having surveyed the view, and fatigued ourselves
greatly by our climb in the summer heat, we descended
to the old theatre, cut into the rock where
it ascends from the village—the smallest and steepest
Greek theatre I had ever seen. Open-air buildings
always look small for their size, but most of
those erected by the Greeks and Romans were so
<pb n='266'/><anchor id='Pg266'/>large that nothing could dwarf them. Even the
theatre of such a town as Taormina in Sicily—which
can never have been populous—is, in addition
to its enchanting site, a very majestic structure;
I will not speak of the immense theatres of Megalopolis
and of Syracuse. But this little place at
Chæronea, so steep that the spectators sat immediately
over one another, looked almost amusing when
cut in the solid rock, after the manner of its enormous
brethren. The guide-book says it is one of
the most ancient theatres in Greece—why, I know
not. It seems to me rather to have been made when
the population was diminishing; and any rudeness
which it shows arises more from economy, than want
of experience.
</p>

<p>
But, small as it is, there are few more interesting
places than the only spot in Chæronea where we can
say with certainty that here Plutarch sat—a man
who, living in an age of decadence, and in a country
village of no importance, has, nevertheless, as much
as any of his countrymen, made his genius felt over
all the world. Apart from the great stores of history
brought together in his <hi rend='italic'>Lives</hi>, which, indeed,
are frequently our only source for the inner life and
spirit of the greatest Greeks of the greatest epochs—the
moral effect of these splendid biographies,
both on poets and politicians through Europe, can
hardly be overrated. From Shakespeare and Alfieri
to the wild savages of the French Revolution,
<pb n='267'/><anchor id='Pg267'/>all kinds of patriots and eager spirits have been
fascinated and excited by these wonderful portraits.
Alfieri even speaks of them as the great discovery
of his life, which he read with tears and with rage.
There is no writer of the Silver Age who gives us
anything like so much valuable information about
early authors, and their general character. More
especially the inner history of Athens in her best
days, the personal features of Pericles, Cimon,
Alcibiades, Nicias, as well as of Themistocles and
of Aristides, would be completely, or almost completely,
lost, if this often despised but invaluable
man had not written for our learning. And he is
still more essentially a good man—a man better and
purer than most Greeks—another Herodotus in fairness
and in honesty. A poor man reputed by his
neighbors <q>a terrible historian,</q> remarked to a
friend of mine, who used to lend him Scott’s novels,
<q>that Scott was a great historian,</q> and being asked
his reason, replied, <q>He makes you to love your
kind.</q> There is a deep significance in this vague
utterance, in which it may be eminently applied to
Plutarch. <q>Here in Chæronea,</q> says Pausanias,
<q>they prepare unguents from the flowers of the
lily and the rose, the narcissus and the iris. These
are balm for the pains of men. Nay, that which is
made of roses, if old wooden images are anointed
with it, saves them, too, from decay.</q> He little
knew how eternally true his words would be, for
<pb n='268'/><anchor id='Pg268'/>though the rose and the iris grow wild and neglected
and yield not now their perfume to soothe the ills of
men, yet from Chæronea comes the eternal balm
of Plutarch’s wisdom, to sustain the oppressed, to
strengthen the patriot, to purify with nobler pity
and terror the dross of human meanness. Nay,
even the crumbling images of his gods arrest their
decay by the spirit of his morals, and revive their
beauty in the sweetness of his simple faith.

<p>
There is a rich supply of water, bursting from a
beautiful old Greek fountain, near the theatre—indeed,
the water supply all over this country is
excellent. There is also an old marble throne in
the church, about which they have many legends,
but no history. The costume of the girls, whom we
saw working in small irrigated plots near the houses,
was beautiful beyond that in other Greek towns.
They wore splendid necklaces of gold and silver
coins, which lay like corselets of chain mail on the
neck and breast; and the dull but rich embroidery
of wool on their aprons and bodices was quite beyond
what we could describe, but not beyond our
highest appreciation.
</p>

<p>
As the day was waning, we were obliged to leave
this most interesting place, and set off again on our
ride home to Lebadea. We had not gone a mile
from the town when we came upon the most pathetic
and striking of all the remains in that country—the
famous lion of Chæronea, which the Thebans set up
<pb n='269'/><anchor id='Pg269'/>to their countrymen who had fallen in the great
battle against Philip of Macedon, in the year 338
<hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi> We had been looking out for this monument,
and on our way to Chæronea, seeing a lofty mound
in the plain, rode up to it eagerly, hoping to find the
lion. But we were disappointed, and were told that
the history of this larger mound was completely unknown.
It evidently commemorates some battle,
and is a mound over the dead, but whether those
slain by Sylla, or those with Tolmides, or those of
some far older conflict, no man can say. It seems,
however, perfectly undisturbed, and grown about
with deep weeds and brushwood, so that a hardy
excavator might find it worth opening, and, perhaps,
coins might tell us of its age.
</p>

<p>
The mound where we found the lion was much
humbler and smaller; in fact, hardly a mound at all,
but a rising knoll, with its centre hollowed out, and
in the hollow the broken pieces of the famous lion.
It had sunk, we are told, into its mound of earth,
originally intended to raise it above the road beside,
and lay there in perfect safety till the present century,
when four English travellers claim to have
discovered it (June 3, 1818). They tried to get it
removed, and, failing in their efforts, covered up the
pieces carefully.<note place="foot">An account of the discovery, by the only surviving member
of the party, Mr. G. L. Taylor, has been published by Mr. W. S.
Vaux in the <hi rend='italic'>Trans. of the Roy. Soc. of Lit.</hi>, 2nd series, vol. viii. pp.
1, <hi rend='italic'>sqq.</hi> The latter gentleman called attention to his paper when
the subject was being discussed in the <hi rend='italic'>Academy</hi> in 1877. A very
different story was told to Colonel Mure, and has passed from his
<hi rend='italic'>Travels</hi> into Murray’s <hi rend='italic'>Guide</hi>. The current belief among the
Greeks seems still to be that a Greek patriot called Odysseus,
perceiving the stone protruding from the clay, and, on striking it,
hearing its hollow ring, dug it out and broke it in pieces, imagining
it to be a record of Philip’s victory over Hellenic liberty.
Some ill-natured people added that he hoped to find treasure
within it.</note> Since that time they seem to have
<pb n='270'/><anchor id='Pg270'/>lain undisturbed, and are still in such a state that a
few days’ labor, and a few pounds of expense, would
restore the work. It is of bluish-gray stone—they
call it Bœotian marble or limestone—and is a work
of the highest and purest merit. The lion is of that
Asiatic type which has little or no mane, and seemed
to us couchant or sitting in attitude, with the head
not lowered to the forepaws, but thrown up.<note place="foot">Mr. Taylor and his friends thought it must have stood in the
attitude of the now abolished lion on Northumberland House.
This did not appear so to us; but it is difficult to decide. The
restoration by Siegel in the <hi rend='italic'>Mon. of the Soc. Arch.</hi> of Rome, for
1856, of which Mr. A. S. Murray most kindly sent me a drawing,
makes the posture a <hi rend='italic'>sitting</hi> one, like that of the sitting lion in
front of the Arsenal at Venice. There is a small sitting lion from
Calymnæ, of the same posture, in the Brit. Museum. The Greeks,
when my account was first published in their papers, became fully
alive to the value of this monument, and anxious for its restoration.
There had been a custodian appointed to watch over it, even
when I was there, but he chanced to be absent when we paid our
visit.</note> The
expression of the face is ideally perfect—rage, grief,
and shame are expressed in it, together with that
<pb n='271'/><anchor id='Pg271'/>noble calmness and moderation which characterize
all good Greek art. The object of the monument is
quite plain, without reading the affecting, though
simple, notice of Pausanias: <q>On the approach to
the city,</q> says he, <q>is the tomb of the Bœotians
who fell in the battle with Philip. It has no inscription;
but the image of a lion is placed upon
it as an emblem of the spirit of these men. The
inscription has been omitted—I suppose, because
the gods had willed that their fortune should not be
equal to their valor.</q> So, then, we have here, in
what may fairly be called a <hi rend='italic'>dated</hi> record, one of the
finest specimens of the sepulchral monuments of the
best age of Greece. It is very much to be regretted
that this splendid figure is not put together and
photographed. Nothing would be more instructive
than a comparison with the finest of modern monuments—Thorwaldsen’s
Lion at Lucerne—the work,
too, of the only modern sculptor who can for one
moment be ranked beside the ancient Greeks. But
the lion of Chæronea now owes its existence to the
accident that no neighboring peasant has in old times
lacked stones for a wall, or for a ditch; and when
Greece awoke to a sense of the preciousness of these
things, it might have been gone, or dashed into useless
fragments.
</p>

<p>
As we saw it, on a splendid afternoon in June, it
lay in perfect repose and oblivion, the fragments
large enough to tell the contour and the style; in
<pb n='272'/><anchor id='Pg272'/>the mouth of the upturned head wild bees were
busy at their work, and the honeycomb was there
between its teeth. The Hebrew story came fresh
upon us, and we longed for the strength which tore
the lion of old, to gather the limbs and heal the rents
of his marble fellow. The lion of Samson was a
riddle to the Philistines which they could not solve;
and so I suppose this lion of Chæronea was a riddle,
too—a deeper riddle to better men—why the patriot
should fall before the despot, and the culture of
Greece before the Cæsarism of Macedonia. Even
within Greece there is no want of remarkable parallels.
This, the last effulgence of the setting sun of
Greek liberty, was commemorated by a lion and a
mound, as the opening struggle at Marathon was
also marked by a lion and a mound. At Marathon
the mound is there and the lion gone—at Chæronea,
the lion is there and the mound gone.<note place="foot">Since these words were written, the labors of the Greek
archæologists have discovered the great <hi rend='italic'>polyandrion</hi> or common
tomb of the dead, which the lion commemorated. They lay in
rows, many of them with broken bones, showing how they had
received their death-wound, and with them were fragments of
broken weapons. Never have we come closer to an ancient battle,
or discovered more affecting records of a great struggle.</note> But doubtless
the earlier lion was far inferior in expression
and in beauty, and was a small object on so large a
tomb. Later men made the sepulchre itself of less
importance, and the poetic element more prominent;
and perhaps this very fact tells the secret of their
<pb n='273'/><anchor id='Pg273'/>failure, and why the refined sculptor of the lion was
no equal in politics and war to the rude carver of
the relief of the Marathonian warrior.
</p>

<p>
These and such like thoughts throng the mind of
him who sits beside the solitary tomb; and it may
be said in favor of its remoteness and difficulty of
access, that in solitude there is at least peace and
leisure, and the scattered objects of interest are
scanned with affection and with care.

<p>
The pilgrim who went of old from Athens to the
shrine of Delphi, to consult the august oracle on
some great difficulty in his own life, or some
great danger to his country, saw before him the
giant Parnassus as his goal, as soon as he reached
the passes of Cithæron. For two or three days he
went across Bœotia with this great landmark before
him, but it was not till he reached Lebadea that he
found himself leaving level roads, and entering
defiles, where great cliffs and narrow glens gave to
his mind a tone of superstition and of awe which
ever dwelt around that wild and dangerous country.
Starting from Lebadea, or, by another road, from
Chæronea, he must go about half-way round Parnassus,
from its east to its south-west aspect; and
this can only be done by threading his way along
torrents and precipices, mounting steep ascents, and
descending into wild glens. This journey among
the Alps of Phocis is perhaps the most beautiful in
all Greece—certainly, with the exception of the
journey from Olympia over Mount Erymanthus,
<pb n='275'/><anchor id='Pg275'/>the most beautiful of all the routes known to me
through the highlands.

<p>
The old priests of Delphi, who were the first
systematic road-builders among the Greeks, had
made a careful way from Thebes into Phocis, for
the use of the pilgrims thronging to their shrine.
It appears that, by way of saving the expense of
paving it all, they laid down or macadamized in
some way a double wheel-track or fixed track, upon
which chariots could run with safety; but we hear
from the oldest times of the unpleasantness of two
vehicles meeting on this road, and of the disputes
that took place as to which of them should turn
aside into the deep mud.<note place="foot">This seems to be implied in the account of the murder of
Laïus by Œdipus, on this very road, as it is described in
Sophocles’s <hi rend='italic'>Œdipus Tyrannus</hi>.</note> We may infer from this
that the lot of pedestrians cannot have been very
pleasant. Now, all these difficulties have vanished
with the road itself. There are nothing but faintly-marked
bridle-paths, often indicated only by the
solitary telegraph wires, which reach over the mountains,
apparently for no purpose whatever; and all
travellers must ride or walk in single file, if they
will not force their way through covert and forest.
</p>

<p>
These wild mountains do not strike the mind with
the painful feeling of desolation which is produced
by the abandoned plains. At no time can they have
supported a large population, and we may suppose
<pb n='276'/><anchor id='Pg276'/>that they never contained more than scattered
hamlets of shepherds, living, as they now do, in
deep brown hairy tents of hides at night, and
wandering along the glens by day, in charge of
great herds of quaint-looking goats with long beards
and spiral horns. The dull tinkling of their bells,
and the eagle’s yelp, are the only sounds which give
variety to the rushing of the wind through the dark
pines, and the falling of the torrent from the rocks.
It is a country in which the consciousness grows not
of solitude, but of smallness—a land of huge form
and feature, meet dwelling for mysterious god and
gloomy giant, but far too huge for mortal man.
</p>

<p>
Our way lay, not directly for Delphi, but for the
curious town of Arachova, which is perched on the
summit of precipices some 4000 feet or more above
the level of the sea. We rode from eight in the
morning till the evening twilight to reach this place,
and all the day through scenes which gave us each
moment some new delight and some new astonishment,
but which could only be described by a painter,
not by any pages of writing, however poetical or
picturesque. It is the misfortune of such descriptions
on paper, that the writer alone has the remembered
image clear before him; no reader can grasp
the detail and frame for himself a faithful picture.
</p>

<p>
We felt that we were approaching Arachova
when we saw the steep slopes above and below our
path planted with vineyards, and here and there
<pb n='277'/><anchor id='Pg277'/>a woman in her gay dress working on the steep
incline, where a stumble would have sent her rolling
many hundreds of feet into some torrent bed. At
one particular spot, where the way turned round a
projecting shoulder, we were struck by seeing at
the same time, to the north, the blue sea under
Eubœa, and, at the south, the Gulf of Corinth
where it nears Delphi—both mere patches among
the mountains, like the little tarns among the Irish
moors, but both great historic waters—old high
roads of commerce and of culture. From any of
the summits such a view from sea to sea would not
be the least remarkable; but it was interesting and
unusual to see it from a mule’s back on one of the
high roads of the country. A moment later, the
houses of Arachova itself attracted all our attention,
lying as they did over against us, and quite near, but
with a great gulf between us and them, which we
were fortunately able to ride round. The town has
a curious, scattered appearance, with interrupted
streets and uncertain plan, owing not only to the
extraordinary nature of the site, but to the fact that
huge boulders, I might say rocks, have been shaken
loose by earthquakes from above, and have come
tumbling into the middle of the town. They crush
a house or two, and stand there in the street. Presently
some one comes and builds a house up against
the side of this rock; others venture in their turn,
and so the town recovers itself, till another
earth<pb n='278'/><anchor id='Pg278'/>quake makes another rent. Since 1870 these earthquakes
have been very frequent. At first they were
very severe, and ruined almost all the town; but
now they are very slight, and so frequent that we
were assured that they happened at some hour <hi rend='italic'>every
day</hi>. I believe this is practically true, though we,
who arrived in the evening and left early next day,
were not so fortunate as to feel the shock ourselves.
But the whole region of Parnassus shows great scars
and wounds from this awful natural scourge.
</p>

<p>
Arachova is remarkable as being one of the very
few towns of Greece of any note which is not built
upon a celebrated site. Everywhere the modern
Greek town is a mere survival of the old. I remember
but three exceptions—Arachova, Hydra, and
Tripolitza,<note place="foot">Indeed Tripolitza lies between the ancient sites of Mantinea
and Tegea, and quite close to the latter.</note> and of these the latter two arose from
special and known circumstances. The prosperity
of Arachova is not so easily explicable. In spite of
its wonderful and curious site, the trade of the place
is, for a Greek town, very considerable. The wines
which they make are of the highest repute, though
to us the free use of resin makes them all equally
worthless. Besides, they work beautifully patterned
rugs of divers-colored wool—rugs which are sold at
high prices all over the Greek waters. They are
used in boats, on saddles, on beds—in fact for every
possible rough use. The patterns are stitched on
<pb n='279'/><anchor id='Pg279'/>with wool, and the widths sewn together in the same
way, with effective rudeness.
</p>

<p>
We had an excellent opportunity of seeing all this
sort of work, as we found the town in some excitement
at an approaching marriage; and we went to
see the bride, whom we found in a spacious room,
with low wooden rafters, in the company of a large
party of her companions, and surrounded on all sides
by her dowry, which consisted, in eastern fashion,
almost altogether of <q>changes of raiment.</q> All
round the room these rich woollen rugs lay in perfect
piles, and from the low ceiling hung in great
numbers her future husband’s white petticoats; for
in that country, as everywhere in Greece, the men
wear the petticoats. The company were all dressed
in full costume—white sleeves, embroidered woollen
aprons, gold and silver coins about the neck, and a
bright red loose belt worn low round the figure. To
complete the picture, each girl had in her left hand
a distaff, swathed about with rich, soft, white wool,
from which her right hand and spindle were deftly
spinning thread, as she walked about the room
admiring the <hi rend='italic'>trousseau</hi>, and joking with us and with
her companions. The beauty of the Arachovite
women is as remarkable as the strength and longevity
of the men, nor do I know any mountaineers
equal to them, except those of some of the valleys
in the Tyrol. But there, as is well known, beauty
is chiefly confined to the men; at Arachova it seemed
<pb n='280'/><anchor id='Pg280'/>fairly distributed. We did not see any one girl of
singular beauty. The average was remarkably high;
and, as might be expected, they were not only very
fair, but of that peculiarly clear complexion, and
vigorous frame, which seem almost always to be
found when a good climate and clear air are combined
with a very high level above the sea.
</p>

<p>
We saw, moreover, what they called a Pyrrhic
dance, which consisted of a string of people, hand-in-hand,
standing in the form of a spiral, and moving
rhythmically, while the outside member of the train
performed curious and violent gymnastics. The
music consisted in the squealing of a horrible clarionette,
accompanied by the beating of a large drum.
The clarionette-player had a leathern bandage about
his mouth, like that which we see in the ancient
reliefs and pictures of double-flute-players. According
as each principal dancer was fatigued, he
passed off from the end of the spiral line, and stuck
a silver coin between the cap and forehead of the
player. The whole motion was extremely slow
throughout the party—the centre of the coil, which
is often occupied by little children, hardly moving
at all, and paying little attention to the dance.
</p>

<p>
In general, the Greek music which I heard—dance
music, and occasional shepherds’ songs—was nothing
but a wild and monotonous chant, with two or three
shakes and ornaments on a high note, running down
to a long drone note at the end. They repeat these
<pb n='281'/><anchor id='Pg281'/>phrases, which are not more than three bars long,
over and over again, with some slight variations of
<hi rend='italic'>appoggiatura</hi>. I was told by competent people at
Athens, that all this was not properly Greek, but
Turkish, and that the long slavery of the Greeks
had completely destroyed the traditions of their
ancient music. Though this seemed certainly true
of the music which I heard, I very much doubt that
any ancient feature so general can have completely
disappeared. When there are national songs of a distinctly
Greek character transmitted all through the
Slavish and Turkish periods, it seems odd that they
should be sung altogether to foreign music. Without
more careful investigation I should be slow to
decide upon such a question. Unfortunately, our
specimens of old Greek music are very few, and
probably very insignificant, all the extant works on
music by the ancients being devoted to theoretical
questions, which are very difficult and not very
profitable. To this subject I have devoted a special
discussion in my <hi rend='italic'>Social Life in Greece</hi>, with what
illustration it is now possible to obtain.
</p>

<p>
The inhabitants wished us to stay with them some
days, which would have given us an opportunity of
witnessing the wedding ceremony, and also of making
excursions to the snowy tops of Mount Parnassus.
But we had had enough of that sort of amusement
in a climb up Mount Ætna, a short time before, and
the five hours’ toiling on the snow in a thick fog was
<pb n='282'/><anchor id='Pg282'/>too fresh in our
    <anchor id="corr282"/><corr sic="memory,">memory.</corr> Beside, we were bound
to catch the weekly steamer at Itea, as the port of
Delphi is now called; and eight additional days, or
rather nights, in this country might have been too
much for the wildest enthusiast. For the wooden
houses of Arachova are beyond all other structures
infested with life, and not even the balconies in the
frosty night air were safe from insect invasions.
</p>

<p>
We therefore started early in the morning, and
kept along the sides of precipices on our way to
the oracle of Delphi. It is not wonderful that the
Arachovites should be famous for superstitions and
legends, and that the inquirers into the remnants of
old Greek beliefs in the present day have found their
richest harvest in this mountain fastness, where there
seems no reason why any belief should ever die out.
More especially the faith in the terrible god of the
dead, Charos, who represents not only the old Charon,
but Pluto also, is here very deep-seated, and many
Arachovite songs and ballads speak of his awful and
relentless visits. Longevity is so usual, and old age
is so hale and green in these Alps, that the death of
the young comes home with far greater force and
pathos here than in unhealthy or immoral societies,
and thus the inroads of Charos are not borne in
sullen silence, but lamented with impatient complaints.
</p>

<p>
At eleven o’clock we came, in the fierce summer
sun, to the ascent into the <q>rocky Pytho,</q> where
<pb n='283'/><anchor id='Pg283'/>the terraced city of old had once harbored pilgrims
from every corner of the civilized world. The ordinary
histories which we read give us but little idea
of the mighty influence of this place in the age of
its faith. We hear of its being consulted by Crœsus,
or by the Romans, and we appreciate its renown
for sanctity; but until of very late years there was
small account taken of its political and commercial
importance. The date of its first rise is hidden in
remote antiquity. As the story goes, a shepherd,
who fed his flocks here, observed the goats, when
they approached the vaporous cavern, springing
about madly, as if under some strange influence.
He came up to see the place himself, and was immediately
seized with the prophetic frenzy. So the
reputation of the place spread, first around the
neighboring pastoral tribes, and then to a wider
sphere.
</p>

<p>
This very possible origin, however, does not distinctly
assert what may certainly be inferred—I
mean the existence of some older and ruder worship,
before the worship of Apollo was here established.
Two arguments make this clear. In the
first place, old legends consistently speak of the
arrival of Apollo here; of his conflict with the
powers of earth, under the form of the dragon
Python; of his having undergone purification for
its murder, and having been formally ceded possession
by its older owners. This distinct allusion
<pb n='284'/><anchor id='Pg284'/>to a previous cult, and one even hostile to Apollo,
but ultimately reconciled with him, is sustained by
the fact that Pausanias describes in the Temple of
Apollo itself two old stones—one apparently an
aërolith—which were treated with great respect,
anointed daily with oil, and adorned with garlands
of flowers. One of these was to the Greeks the
centre of the earth (<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ὀμφαλός</foreign>), and beside it were
two eagles in gold, to remind one of the legend that
Zeus had started two eagles from the ends of the
earth, and that they met at this exact spot midway.
These old and shapeless stories, which occur elsewhere
in Greek temples, point to the older stage
of fetish worship, before the Greeks had risen to
the art of carving a statue, or of worshipping the
unseen deity without a gross material symbol.
</p>

<p>
The researches of M. A. Lebègue, at Delos, have
given us another instance. He found that the old
shrine of Apollo has been made in imitation of a
cave, and that in the recess of the shrine, made
with large slabs of stone forming a gable over a
natural fissure in the rock, there was an ancient,
rude, sacred stone, on which were remaining the
feet of the statue, which had afterward been added
to give dignity to the improved worship. M. Lebègue’s
work at Delos has been completed and superseded
by M. Homolle.
</p>

<p>
Homer speaks in the Iliad of the great wealth of
the Pythian shrine; and the Hymn to the Pythian
<pb n='285'/><anchor id='Pg285'/>Apollo implies that its early transformations were
completed. But seeing that the god Apollo, though
originally an Ionian god, as at Delos, was here worshipped
distinctively by the Dorians, we shall not
err if we consider the rise of the oracle to greatness
coincident with the rise and spreading of the Dorians
over Greece—an event to which we can assign no
date, but which, in legend, comes next after the
Trojan War, and seems near the threshold of real
history. The absolute submission of the Spartans,
when they rose to power, confirmed the authority
of the shrine, and so it gradually came to be the
Metropolitan See, so to speak, in the Greek religious
world. It seems that the influence of this
oracle was, in old days, always used in the direction
of good morals and of enlightenment. When
neighboring states were likely to quarrel, the oracle
was often a peacemaker, and even acted as arbitrator—a
course usual in earlier Greek history, and in
which they anticipated the best results of our nineteenth-century
culture. So again, when excessive
population demanded an outlet, the oracle was consulted
as to the proper place, and the proper leader
to be selected; and all the splendid commercial development
of the sixth century <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>, though not
produced, was at least sanctioned and promoted, by
the Delphic Oracle. Again, in determining the
worship of other gods and the founding of new
services to great public benefactors, the oracle
<pb n='286'/><anchor id='Pg286'/>seems to have been the acknowledged authority—thus
taking the place of the Vatican in Catholic
Europe, as the source and origin of new dogmas,
and of new worships and formularies.

<p>
At the same time the treasure-house of the shrine
was the largest and safest of banks, where both individuals
and states might deposit treasure—nay,
even the states seem to have had separate chambers—and
from which they could also borrow money, at
fair interest, in times of war and public distress.
The rock of Delphi was held to be the navel or centre
of the earth’s surface, and certainly in a social
and religious sense this was the case for all the
Greek world. Thus the priests were informed, by
perpetual visitors from all sides, of all the last news—of
the general aspect of politics—of the new developments
of trade—of the latest discoveries in
outlying and barbarous lands—and were accordingly
able, without any genius or supernatural inspiration,
to form their judgments upon wider experience
and better knowledge than anybody else
could command. This advice, which was really
sound and well-considered, was given to people who
took it to be divine, and acted upon it with implicit
faith and zeal. Of course, the result was in general
satisfactory; and so even individuals made use of it
as a sort of high confessional, to which they came
as pilgrims at some important crisis of their life;
and finding by the response that the god seemed to
<pb n='287'/><anchor id='Pg287'/>know all about the affairs of every city, went away
fully satisfied with the divine authority of the oracle.
</p>

<p>
This great and deserved general reputation was
not affected by occasional rumors of bribed responses
or of dishonest priestesses. Such things must happen
everywhere; but, as Lord Bacon long ago observed,
human nature is more affected by affirmatives
than negatives—that is to say, a few cases of brilliantly
accurate prophecy will outweigh a great
number of cases of doubtful advices or even of
acknowledged corruption. So the power of the
Popes has lasted in some respects undiminished
to the present day, and they are still regarded by
many as infallible, even though historians have published
many dreadful lives of some of them, and
branded them as men of worse than average
morals.
</p>

<p>
The greatness and the national importance of the
Delphic Oracle lasted from the invasion of the
Dorians down to the Persian War, certainly more
than three centuries; when the part which it took in
the latter struggle gave it a blow from which it
seems never to have recovered. When the invasion
of Xerxes was approaching, the Delphic priests informed
accurately of the immense power of the Persians,
made up their minds that all resistance was
useless, and counselled absolute submission or flight.
According to all human probabilities they were
right, for nothing but a series of blunders could
pos<pb n='288'/><anchor id='Pg288'/>sibly have checked the Persians. But surely the
god ought to have inspired them to utter patriotic
responses, and thus to save themselves in case of
such a miracle as actually happened. I cannot but
suspect that they hoped to gain the favor of Xerxes,
and remain under him what they had hitherto been,
a wealthy and protected corporation.<note place="foot">This was done by the monks at Athos, when Mahomet II.
was threatening Constantinople. They foresaw his victory, and by
early submission made their own terms, and saved both their liberties
and their property.</note> Perhaps they
even saw too far, and perceived that the success of
the Greeks would bring the Ionic states into prominence;
but we must not credit them with too much.
The result, however, told greatly against them. The
Greeks won, and the Athenians got the lead,—the
Athenians, who very soon developed a secular and
worldly spirit, and who were by no means awed by
responses which had threatened them and weakened
their hands, when their own courage and skill had
brought them deliverance. And we can imagine
even Themistocles, not to speak of Pericles and
Antiphon, looking upon the oracles as little more
than a convenient way of persuading the mob to follow
a policy which it was not able to understand.
The miraculous defeat of the Persians by the god,
who repeated his wonders when the Gauls attacked
his shrine, should be read in Herodotus and in Pausanias.

<p>
It is with some sadness that we turn from the
splendid past of Delphi to its miserable present.
The sacred cleft in the earth, from which rose the
cold vapor that intoxicated the priestess, is blocked
up and lost. As it lay within the shrine of the
temple, it may have been filled by the falling ruins,
or still more completely destroyed by an earthquake.
But, apart from these natural possibilities, we are
told that the Christians, after the oracle was closed
by Theodosius, filled up and effaced the traces
of what they thought a special entrance to hell,
where communications had been held with the Evil
One.
</p>

<p>
The three great fountains or springs of the town
are still in existence. The first and most striking
of these bursts out from between the Phædriades—two
shining peaks, which stand up one thousand
feet over Delphi, and so close together as to leave
only a dark and mysterious gorge or fissure, not
twenty feet wide, intervening. The aspect of these
twin peaks, so celebrated by the Greek poets, with
their splendid stream, the Castalian fount, bursting
from between them, is indeed grand and startling.
A great square bath is cut in the rock, just at the
mouth of the gorge; but the earthquake of 1870,
which made such havoc of Arachova, has been busy
here also, and has tumbled a huge block into this
bath, thus covering the old work, as well as several
votive niches cut into the rocky wall. This was the
<pb n='290'/><anchor id='Pg290'/>place where arriving pilgrims purified themselves
with hallowed water.
</p>

<p>
In the great old days the oracle gave responses
on the seventh of each month, and even then only
when the sacrifices were favorable. If the victims
were not perfectly without blemish, they could not
be offered; if they did not tremble all over when
brought to the altar, the day was thought unpropitious.
The inquirers entered the great temple in festal
dress, with olive garlands and <hi rend='italic'>stemmata</hi>, or fillets of
wool, led by the <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ὅσιοι</foreign>, or sacred guardians of the
temple, who were five of the noblest citizens of
Delphi. The priestesses, on the contrary—there
were three at the same time, who officiated in turn—though
Delphians also, were not frequently of
noble family. When the priestess was placed on the
sacred tripod by the chief interpreter, or <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">προφήτης</foreign>,
over the exhalations, she was seized with frenzy—often
so violent that the <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ὅσιοι</foreign> were known to have
fled in terror, and she herself to have become insensible,
and to have died. Her ravings in this state
were carefully noted down, and then reduced to
sense, and of old always to verses, by the attendant
priests, who of course interpreted disconnected words
with a special reference to the politics or other circumstances
of the inquirers.
</p>

<p>
This was done in early days with perfect good
faith. During the decline of religion there were of
course many cases of corruption and of partiality,
<pb n='291'/><anchor id='Pg291'/>and, indeed, the whole style and dignity of the oracle
gradually decayed with the decay of Greece itself.
Presently, when crowds came, and states were extremely
jealous of the right of precedence in inquiring
of the god, it was found expedient to give responses
every day, and this was done to private
individuals, and even for trivial reasons. So also
the priests no longer took the trouble to shape the
responses into verse; and when the Phocians in
the sacred war (355–46 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>) seized the treasures,
and applied to military purposes some ten thousand
talents, the shrine suffered a blow from which it
never recovered. Still, the quantity of splendid
votive offerings which were not convertible into
ready money made it the most interesting place in
Greece, next to Athens and Olympia, for lovers of
the arts: and the statues, tripods, and other curiosities
described there by Pausanias, give a wonderful
picture of the mighty oracle even in its decay.<note place="foot">Cf. also Plutarch’s tract <hi rend='italic'>de Pyth. orac.</hi> for details of <hi rend='italic'>ciceroni</hi>
and visitors in his day.</note>
The greatest sculptors, painters, and architects had
lavished their labor upon the buildings. Though
Nero had carried off five hundred bronze statues,
the traveller estimated the remaining works of art at
three thousand, and yet these seem to have been
almost all statues, and not to have included tripods,
pictures, and other gifts. The Emperor Constantine
brought away (330 <hi rend='small'>A. D.</hi>) a great number to adorn
<pb n='292'/><anchor id='Pg292'/>his capital—more especially the bronze tripod,
formed of three intertwined serpents, with their
heads supporting a golden vessel, which Pausanias,
the Spartan King, had dedicated as the leader of
Greece to commemorate the great victory over Xerxes.
This tripod (which was found standing in its
place at Constantinople by our soldiers in 1852)
contains the list of states according to the account
of Herodotus, who describes its dedication, and who
saw it at Delphi.
</p>

<p>
When the Emperor Julian, the last great champion
of paganism, desired to consult the oracle on his
way to Persia, in 362 <hi rend='small'>A. D.</hi>, it replied: <q>Tell the
king the fair-wrought dwelling has sunk into the
dust: Phœbus has no longer a shelter or a prophetic
laurel, neither has he a speaking fountain; the fair
water is dried up.</q> Thus did the shrine confess,
even to the ardent and hopeful Julian, that its power
had passed away, and, as it were by a supreme
effort, declared to him the great truth which he refused
to see—that paganism was gone for ever, and
a new faith had arisen for the nations of the Roman
Empire.
</p>

<p>
About the year 390, Theodosius took the god at
his word, and closed the oracle finally. The temple—with
its cella of 100 feet—with its Doric and Ionic
pillars—with its splendid sculptures upon the pediments—sank
into decay and ruin. The walls and
porticos tumbled down the precipitous cliffs; the
<pb n='293'/><anchor id='Pg293'/>prophetic chasm was filled up by the Christians with
fear and horror; and, as if to foil any attempt to
recover from ruins the site and plan, the modern
Greeks built their miserable hamlet of Castri upon
the spot; so that it is only among the walls and
foundations laid bare by earthquakes that we can
now seek for marble capitals and votive inscriptions.
</p>

<p>
One or two features are still unchanged. The
three fine springs, to which Delphi doubtless owed
its first selection for human habitation, are still there—Castalia,
of which we have spoken; Cassotis,
which was led artificially into the very shrine of the
god; and Delphussa, which was, I suppose, the
water used for secular purposes by the inhabitants.
The stadium, too, a tiny racecourse high above the
town, in the only place where they could find a
level 150 yards, is still visible; and we see at once
what the importance of games must have been at a
sacred Greek town, when such a thing as a stadium
should be attempted here.<note place="foot">The hippodrome for the chariot races was, however, in the
plain beneath, as Pausanias tells us (x. 37, 4).</note> The earliest competitions
had been in music—that is, in playing the lyre, in
recitation, and probably in the composition of original
poems; but presently the physical contests of
Olympia began to outdo the splendor of Delphi.
Moreover, the Spartans would not compete in minstrelsy,
which they liked and criticised, but left to
professional artists. Accordingly, the priests of
<pb n='294'/><anchor id='Pg294'/>Delphi were too practical a corporation not to widen
the programme of their games, and Pindar has celebrated
the Pythian victors as hardly second to those
at the grand festival of Elis.
</p>

<p>
There is yet one more element in the varied greatness
of Delphi. It was here that the religious
federation of Greece—the Amphictyony of which we
hear so often—held its meetings alternately with the
meetings at the springs of Thermopylæ. When I
stood high up on the stadium at Delphi, the great
scene described by the orator Æschines came fresh
upon me, when he looked upon the sacred plain of
Krissa, and called all the worshippers of the god to
clear it of the sacrilegious Amphissians, who had
covered it with cattle and growing crops. The
plain, he says, is easily surveyed from the place of
meeting—a statement which shows that the latter
cannot have been in the town of Delphi: for a
great shoulder of the mountain effectually hides the
whole plain from every part of the town.
</p>

<p>
The Pylæa, or place of assembly, was, however,
outside, and precisely at the other side of this huge
shoulder, so that what Æschines says is true; but it
is not true, as any ordinary student imagines, that
he was standing in Delphi itself. He was, in fact,
completely out of sight of the town, though not a
mile from it. There is no more common error than
this among our mere book scholars—and I daresay
there are not many who realize the existence of this
<pb n='295'/><anchor id='Pg295'/>suburban Pylæa, and its situation close to, but invisible
from, Delphi. It certainly never came home
to me till I began to look for the spot from which
Æschines might have delivered his famous extempore
address.
</p>

<p>
When we rode round to the real place we found
his words amply verified. Far below us stretched
the plain from Amphissa to Kirrha, at right angles
with the gorge above which Delphi is situated.
The river-courses of the Delphic springs form, in
fact, a regular zigzag. When they tumble from
their great elevation on the rocks into the valley,
they join the Pleistus, running at right angles toward
the west; when this torrent has reached the plain,
it turns again due south, and flows into the sea at
the Gulf of Kirrha. Thus, looking from Pylæa,
you see the upper part of the plain, and the gorge
to the north-west of it, where Amphissa occupies its
place in a position similar to the mouth of the gorge
of Delphi. The southern rocks of the gorge over
against Delphi shut out the sea and the actual bay;
but a large rich tract, covered with olive-woods, and
medlars, and oleanders, stretches out beneath the
eye—verily a plain worth fighting for, and a possession
still more precious, when it commanded the
approach of pilgrims from the sea; for the harbor
duties and tolls of Kirrha were once a large revenue,
and their loss threatened the oracle with poverty.
This levying of tolls on the pilgrims to Delphi
be<pb n='296'/><anchor id='Pg296'/>came quite a national question in the days of Solon;
it resulted in a great war, led by the Amphictyonic
Council. Kirrha was ruined, and its land dedicated
to the god, in order to protect the approach from
future difficulties. So this great tract was, I suppose,
devoted to pasture, and the priests probably
levied a rent from the people who choose to graze
their cattle on the sacred plain. The Amphissians,
who lived, not at the seaside, but at the mountain
side of the plain, were never accused of robbing or
taxing the pilgrims; but having acquired for many
generations the right of pasture, they advanced to
the idea of tilling their pastures, and were undisturbed
in this privilege till the mischievous orator,
Æschines, for his own purposes, fired the Delphians
with rage, kindled a war, and so brought Philip into
Greece. These are the historical circumstances
which should be called to mind by the traveller, who
rides down the steep descent from Delphi to the
plain, and then turns through the olive-woods to the
high road to Itea, as the port of Delphi is now called.
</p>

<p>
A few hours brought us to the neighborhood of
the sea. The most curious feature of this valley, as
we saw it, was a long string of camels tied together,
and led by a small and shabby donkey. Our mules
and horses turned with astonishment to examine
these animals, which have survived here only,
though introduced by the Turks into many parts
of Greece.
</p>

<pb n='297'/><anchor id='Pg297'/>

<p>
The port of Itea is one of the stations at which
the Greek coasting steamers now call, and, accordingly,
the place is growing in importance. If a
day’s delay were allowed, to let tourists ride up to
the old seat of the oracle, and if the service were
better regulated so as to compete in convenience
with the train journey from Patras to Athens, I
suppose no traveller going to Greece would choose
any other route. For he would see all the beautiful
coasts of Acarnania and Ætolia on the one side, and
of Achaia on the other; he could then take Delphi
on his way, and would land again at Corinth. Here
again, a day, or part of a day, should be allowed to
see the splendid Acro-Corinthus, of which more in
another chapter. The traveller might thus reach
Athens with an important part of Greece already
visited, and have more leisure to turn his attention
to the monuments and curiosities of that city and
of Attica. It is worth while to suggest these things,
because most men who go to Greece find, as I did,
that, with some better previous information, they
could have economized both time and money. I
can also advise that the coasting steamer should be
abandoned at Itea, from which the traveller can
easily get horses to Delphi and Arachova, and from
thence to Chæronea, Lebadea, and through Thebes
to Athens. So he would arrive there by a land tour,
which would make him acquainted with all Bœotia.
He might next go by train from Athens to Corinth
<pb n='298'/><anchor id='Pg298'/>(stopping on the way at Megara), and then into the
Peloponnese; going first to Mycenæ and Argos, and
then taking another steamer round to Sparta, and
riding up through Laconia, Arcadia, and Elis, so
as to come out at Patras, or by boat to Zante, where
the steamer homeward would pick him up. Of
course, special excursions through Attica, and to
the islands, are not included in this sketch, as they
can easily be made from Athens.
</p>

<p>
But surely, no voyage in Greece can be called
complete which does not include a visit to the
famous shrine of Delphi, where the wildness and
ruggedness of nature naturally suggest the powers
of earth and air, that sway our lives unseen—where
the quaking soil and the rent rocks speak a strength
above the strength of mortal man—and where a
great faith, based upon his deepest hopes and fears,
gained a moral empire over all the nation, and exercised
it for centuries, to the purifying and the ennobling
of the Hellenic race. The oracle is long
silent, the priestess forgotten, the temple not only
ruined, but destroyed; and yet the grand responses
of that noble shrine are not forgotten, nor are they
dead. For they have contributed their part and
added their element to the general advancement of
the world, and to the emancipation of man from immorality
and superstition into the true liberty of a
good and enlightened conscience.

<p>
The thousands of visitors, whose ships thronged
the bay of Katakolo every four years in the great
old times, cannot have been fairly impressed with
the beauty of the country at first sight. Most other
approaches to the coast of Greece are far more
striking. For although, on a clear day, the mountains
of Arcadia are plainly visible, and form a fine
background to the view, from the great bar of Erymanthus
on the north, round to the top of Lykæon
far south-west, the foreground has not, and never
had, either the historic interest or the beauty of the
many bays and harbors in other parts of Greece.
Yet I am far from asserting that it is actually wanting
even in this respect. As we saw the bay in a
quiet summer sunset, with placid water reflecting a
sleeping cloud and a few idle sails in its amber glow,
with a wide circle of low hills and tufted shore
bathed in a golden haze, which spread its curtain
of light athwart all the distance, so that the great
snowy comb of Erymanthus alone seemed suspended
by some mystery in the higher blue—the view was
<pb n='300'/><anchor id='Pg300'/>not indeed very Greek, but still it was beautiful, and
no unsuitable dress wherein the land might clothe
itself to welcome the traveller, and foretell him its
sunny silence and its golden mystery.
</p>

<p>
The carriage-way along the coast passes by sand-hills,
and sandy fields of vines, which were being
tilled when we saw them by kindly but squalid
peasants, some of whom lived in wretched huts of
skins, enclosed with a rough fence. But these were
probably only temporary dwellings, for the thrift and
diligence of the southern Greek seems hardly compatible
with real penury. Mendicancy, except in
the case of little children who do it for the nonce,
seems unknown in the Morea.
</p>

<p>
A dusty ride of two hours, relieved now and then
for a moment by the intense perfume from the
orange blossoms of gardens fenced with mighty
aloes, brought us to the noisy and stirring town of
Pyrgos.<note place="foot">This journey I since made by rail, in this place a harmless
innovation.</note> We found this town, one of the most
thriving in Greece, quite as noisy as Naples in proportion
to its size, full of dogs barking, donkeys
braying, and various shopkeepers screaming out their
wares—especially frequent where young shrill-voiced
boys were so employed. Nowhere does the ultra-democratic
temper of new Greek social life show
itself more manifestly than in these disturbed streets.
Not only does every member of human society,
how<pb n='301'/><anchor id='Pg301'/>ever young or ill-disposed, let his voice be heard
without reserve, but it seems to be considered an infraction
upon liberty to silence yelping dogs, braying
donkeys, or any other animal which chooses to disturb
its neighbors.
</p>

<p>
The whole town, like most others in Greece, even
in the Arcadian highlands, is full of half-built and
just finished houses, showing a rapid increase of
prosperity, or perhaps a return of the population
from country life into the towns which have always
been so congenial to the race. But if the latter be
the fact, there yet seems no slackening in the agriculture
of the country, which in the Morea is strikingly
diligent and laborious, reaching up steep hillsides,
and creeping along precipices, winning from
ungrateful nature every inch of niggard soil.<note place="foot">Cf. the passage quoted from M. Georges Perrot above, <ref target="Pg185">p. 185</ref>.</note> This
is indeed the contrast of northern and southern
Greece. In Bœotia the rich plains of Thebes and
Orchomenos are lying fallow, while all the rugged
mountains of Arcadia are yielding wine and oil.
The Greeks will tell you that it is the result of the
security established by their Government in those
parts of Greece which are not accessible from the
Turkish frontier. They assert that if their present
frontier were not at Thermopylæ but at Tempe, or
even farther north, the rich plains of northern Greece
would not lie idle through fear of the bandits, which
<pb n='302'/><anchor id='Pg302'/>every disturbance excites about the boundaries of
ill-guarded kingdoms.
</p>

<p>
The carriage road from Pyrgos up to Olympia was
just finished, and it is now possible to drive all the
way from the sea, but we preferred the old method
of travelling on horseback to the terrors of a newly-constructed
Greek thoroughfare. There is, moreover,
in wandering on unpaved thoroughfares, along
meadows, through groves and thickets, and across
mountains, a charm which no dusty carriage road
can ever afford. We soon came upon the banks of
the Alpheus, which we followed as our main index,
though at times we were high above it, and at times
in the meadows at the water-side; at times again
mounting some wooded ridge which had barred the
way of the stream, and forced it to take a wide
circuit from our course, or again crossing the deep
cuttings made by rivulets which come down from
northern Elis to swell the river from mile to mile.
</p>

<p>
Our path must have been almost the same as was
followed by the crowds which came from the west to
visit the Olympic games in classical days: they
must have ascended along the windings of the river,
and as they came upon each new amphitheatre of
hills, and each new tributary stream, they may have
felt the impatience which we felt that this was not
the sacred <hi rend='italic'>Altis</hi>, and that this was not the famous
confluence of the Kladeus. But the season in which
they travelled—the beginning of July—can never
<pb n='303'/><anchor id='Pg303'/>have shown them the valley in its true beauty. Instead
of a glaring dry bed of gravel, and meadows
parched with heat, we found the Alpheus a broad
and rapid river, which we crossed on horseback with
difficulty; we found the meadows green with sprouting
corn and bright with flowers, and all along the
slopes the trees were bursting into bud and blossom,
and filling the air with the rich scent of spring.
Huge shrubs of arbutus and of mastich closed
around the paths, while over them the Judas tree
and the wild pear covered themselves with purple
and with white, and on every bank great scarlet
anemones opened their wistful eyes in the morning
sun.

<p>
When we came to the real Olympia the prospect
was truly disenchanting. However interesting excavations
may be, they are always exceedingly ugly.
Instead of grass and flowers, and pure water, we
found the classic spot defaced with great mounds of
earth, and trodden bare of grass. We found the
Kladeus flowing a turbid drain into the larger river.
We found hundreds of workmen, and wheel-barrows,
and planks, and trenches, instead of solitude and the
song of birds. Thus it was that we found the famous
temple of Zeus.
</p>

<p>
This temple was in many respects one of the most
celebrated in Greece, especially on account of the
great image of Zeus, which Phidias himself wrought
for it in gold and ivory, and of which Pausanias has
<pb n='304'/><anchor id='Pg304'/>left us a very wonderful description (<hi rend='small'>V. II</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>sqq.</hi>). It
was carried away to Constantinople, and of course
its precious material precluded all chance of its surviving
through centuries of ignorance and bigotry.
The temple itself, to judge from its appearance, was
somewhat older than the days of Phidias, for it is of
that thickset and massive type which we only find
in the earlier Doric temples, and which rather reminds
us of Pæstum than of Athenian remains. It
was built by a local architect, Libon, and of a very
coarse limestone from the neighborhood, which was
covered with stucco, and painted chiefly white, to
judge from the fragments which remain. But it
seems as if the Eleans had done all they could to
add splendor to the building, whenever their funds
permitted. The tiles of the roof were not of burnt
clay, but of Pentelican marble, the well-known and
beautiful invention of the Naxian Byzes. Moreover,
Phidias and a number of his fellow-workers or subordinates
at Athens, as well as other artists, had
been invited to Olympia, to adorn the temple, and to
them we owe the pediments, probably also the
metopes, and many of the statues, with which all
the sacred enclosure around the edifice was literally
thronged. Subsequent generations added to this
splendor: a gilded figure of Victory, with a gold
shield, was set upon the apex of the gable; gilded
pitchers at the extremities; gilded shields were
fastened all along the architraves by Mummius,
<pb n='305'/><anchor id='Pg305'/>from the spoils of Corinth, and the great statue of
Zeus within still remained, the wonder and the awe
of the ancient world.
</p>

<p>
But with the fall of paganism and the formal
extinction of the Olympic games (394 <hi rend='small'>A. D.</hi>) the
glories of the temple fell into decay. The great
statue in the shrine was carried away to Byzantium;
many of the votive bronzes and marbles which stood
about the sacred grove were transported to Italy;
and at last a terrible earthquake, apparently in the
fifth century, levelled the whole temple almost with
the ground. The action of this extraordinary earthquake
is still plainly to be traced in the now uncovered
ruins. It upheaved the temple from the centre,
throwing the pillars of all the four sides outward,
where most of them lie with their drums separated,
but still complete in all parts, and only requiring
mechanical power to set them up again. Some preliminary
shakes had caused pieces of the pediment
sculptures to fall out of their place, for they were
found at the foot of the temple steps; but the main
shock threw the remainder to a great distance, and
I saw the work of Alkamenes being unearthed more
than twenty-five yards from its proper site.
</p>

<p>
In spite of this convulsion, the floor of the temple,
with its marble work, and its still more beautiful
mosaic, is still there, and it seemed doubtful to the
Germans whether there is even a crack now to be
found in it. About the ruins there gathered some
<pb n='306'/><anchor id='Pg306'/>little population, for many fragments were found
built into walls of poor and late construction; but
this work of destruction was fortunately arrested by
a sudden overflow of the Alpheus, caused by the
bursting of one of the mountain lakes about Pheneus.
The river then covered all the little plain of Olympia
with a deep layer of fine sand and of mud. A
thicket of arbutus and mastich sprang from this
fertile soil, and so covered all traces of antiquity,
that when Chandler visited the place 100 years ago,
nothing but a part of the cella wall was over ground,
and this was since removed by neighboring builders.
But the site being certain, it only required the enterprise
of modern research to lay bare the old level so
fortunately hidden by the interposition of nature.
The traveller who now visits Olympia can see the
whole plan and contour of the great temple, with
all its prostrate pillars lying around it. He can
stand on the very spot where once was placed the
unrivalled image—the masterpiece of Phidias’s art.
He can see the old mosaic in colored pebbles, with
its exquisite design, which later taste—probably
Roman—thought well to cover with a marble pavement.
But far above all, he can find in adjoining
sheds<note place="foot">A commodious stone museum has since been built, and the
treasures are doubtless by this time transferred to it. But the
great earthquake of 1885, so near Olympia, makes us tremble for
the safety of any sculpture in a stone building under a solid roof.
How terrible if the house were to fall on the <hi rend='italic'>Hermes</hi>!</note> not only the remains of the famous <hi rend='italic'>Niké</hi> of
<pb n='307'/><anchor id='Pg307'/>Pæonius, which stood on a pedestal close to the
east front, but the greater part of the splendid
pediment sculptures, which will henceforth rank
among the most important relics of Greek art.
These noble compositions have been restored with
tolerable completeness, and now stand next to the
pediments of the Parthenon in conception and in
general design.
</p><anchor id="ill306"/><index index="fig" level1="Statue of Niké, by Paeonius"/>

</else></pgIf>
<p>
For even if the restoration were never accomplished,
there is enough in the fragments of the
figures already recovered to show the genius of
both sculptors, but particularly of Alkamenes, the
author of the western pediment. This perfectly
agrees with the note of Pausanias, who adds, in
mentioning this very work, that Alkamenes was
considered in his day an artist second only to
Phidias.
</p>

<p>
It was objected to me by learned men on the spot,
that the eastern pediment, being the proper front of
the temple, must have been the more important, and
that Pæonius, as we know from an inscription, boasts
that he obtained the executing of it by competition,
thus proving that he was, at least in this case, preferred
to his rivals. But the decided superiority of
Alkamenes’s design leads me to suppose that the
boast of Pæonius only applies to the eastern pediment,
and that probably the western had been already
assigned to Alkamenes. Nor do I agree with the
view that the eastern pediment must have been
<pb n='308'/><anchor id='Pg308'/>artistically the most important. In several Greek
temples—<hi rend='italic'>e. g.</hi>, the Parthenon, the temple at Bassæ,
and in this—the great majority of visitors must
have approached it from the rear, which should
accordingly have been quite the prominent side for
artistic decoration. Let me add that far more action
was permitted in the groups on this side, while over
the entrance the figures were staid and in repose, as
if to harmonize with the awe and silence of the
entering worshippers. Be these things as they may,
the work of Alkamenes is certainly superior to that
which remains to us of Pæonius in the eastern pediment,
and in his figure of winged Victory, which
was, I think, greatly overpraised by the critics who
saw it soon after its discovery.<note place="foot">This judgment of mine has since been confirmed by the
authority of Overbeck. It is indeed very hard to estimate rightly
a new discovery of this kind. I rated the work of Alkamenes,
perhaps, too highly.</note>
</p>

<p>
The composition of the groups in the pediments
and friezes has been described by Pausanias (<hi rend='small'>V.</hi> 10,
§§ 6–10) in a passage of great interest, which has
given rise to much controversy. The general
impression of Drs. Hirschfeld and Weil, when I
was at Olympia, was against the accuracy of
Pausanias, whom they considered to have blindly
set down whatever the local cicerones told him.
That of Dr. Purgold was in his favor. The traveller
says, however, that the eastern pediment, in which,
<pb n='309'/><anchor id='Pg309'/>as already remarked, it was not usual to represent
violent action, depicted the preparation of the chariot
race between Pelops and Œnomaus. In the centre
was Zeus, whose torso has been recovered, and at the
narrow ends of the field were figures of the Alpheus
and Kladeus, to the right and left of the spectator
respectively. These figures are partly recovered—graceful
young men lying forward on the ground,
and raising their heads to witness the contest.
</p>

<p>
It is worth pausing for a moment upon this disposition,
which was so usual as to be almost conventional
in the pediments sculptured during the best
epochs of Greek art. In the centre, where the field
was very high, and admitted a colossal figure, it was
usual to place the god whose providence guided the
events around him, and this god was represented
calm and without excitement. Then came the
mythical event grouped on both sides; but at the
ends, where the field narrowed to an angle, it was
usual to represent the calmness or impassiveness of
external nature. This was done in Greek sculpture
not by trees and hills, but by the gods who symbolized
them. So thoroughly was nature personified in
Greek art, that its picturesqueness was altogether
postponed to its living conscious sympathy with
man, and thus to a Greek the proper representation
of the rivers of Olympia was no landscape, but the
graceful forms of the river gods—intelligent and
human, yet calm spectators, as nature is wont to be.
<pb n='310'/><anchor id='Pg310'/>The very same idea is carried out more characteristically
in the pediment of Alkamenes, where, in
spite of the violent conflict of Centaurs and Lapithæ,
the central and extreme figures, as I shall presently
notice, are perfectly unmoved witnesses of lawless
violence.
</p>

<p>
The arrangement of the rest of the eastern pediment
was evidently quite symmetrical. On Zeus’s
right hand was Œnomaus, his wife Sterope, his
charioteer Myrtilus sitting before the four horses,
and two grooms; on his left, Pelops, Hippodamia,
and a like number of horses and attendants. A
good many pieces of these figures have been found,
sufficient to tempt several art-critics to make conjectural
restorations of the pediment, one of which
is now set up, I believe, in the museum at Berlin.
</p>

<p>
The western pediment, of which more, and more
striking, fragments are recovered, is more difficult
to restore, because Pausanias is unfortunately not
nearly so precise in describing it, and because,
moreover, he is suspected of a serious blunder about
the central figure. Contrary to the precedent just
mentioned, he says that this central figure is Pirithous,
whose wife is just being carried off by the
Centaurs, and ought therefore to be in violent excitement.
But there had been found, just before we
arrived at Olympia, a colossal head, of the noblest
conception, which seems certainly to belong to the
pediment sculptures, and which must be the head of
<pb n='311'/><anchor id='Pg311'/>this central figure. It is perfectly calm and divine
in expression, and almost forces upon the spectator
the conclusion to which all the best judges lean, that
it must be an Apollo, and that this was the central
figure, while Pirithous was more actively engaged.
There was on each side of this figure a Centaur
carrying off, the one a maiden (I suppose the bride)
and the other a boy, and Kæneus and Theseus at
each side, coming to the rescue.
</p>

<p>
But on the other figures Pausanias is silent; and
there were certainly two beautiful mountain or river
nymphs at the extremities—lying figures, with a
peculiar head-dress of a thick bandage wrapped all
round the hair—which are among the most perfect
of the figures recovered. It seems also certain that
Pirithous must have been somewhere on the pediment;
and this would suggest another figure to
correspond to him at the other side, for these groups
were always symmetrical. In this case Pausanias
has omitted four figures at least in his description,
and seems to have besides mistaken the largest and
most important of all. The Germans cite in proof
of these strictures his passing remark on the Metopes,
representing the labors of Herakles, on one of which
was (he says) Herakles about to relieve Atlas,
whereas this slab, which has been found, really
represents Herakles carrying the globe, and one of
the Hesperidæ assisting him, while Atlas is bringing
to him the apple.
</p>

<pb n='312'/><anchor id='Pg312'/>

<p>
This criticism will seem to most ordinary people
too minute, and I am rather disposed to think well
of Pausanias as an intelligent traveller, though he,
of course, made some mistakes.
</p>

<p>
But since the above words were written sufficient
time has elapsed not only to bring the excavations to
an end, but to study more carefully the recovered
fragments, and offer a calmer judgment as to their
merits. On the whole, the strong feeling of the best
critics has been one of disappointment. The design
of both pediments still seems to me masterly, especially
that of Alkamenes, but there can be no doubt
that the execution is far below that of the Parthenon
marbles. There are some positive faults—inability
to reproduce drapery (while the nude parts are very
true to nature), and great want of care in other
details. It must be urged in answer that the pediments
were meant to be seen about forty feet from
the ground, and that the painting of the figures
must have brought out the features of the drapery
neglected in the carving. However true this may
be, we can answer at once that the workmen of
Phidias did not produce this kind of work. The
first quality of the Attic school was that conscientiousness
in detail which meets us in every great age
of art.
</p>

<p>
So serious have these difficulties appeared to some,
that they have actually suspected Pausanias of being
misled, and having falsely attributed the work of
<pb n='313'/><anchor id='Pg313'/>obscure local artists to Alkamenes, and perhaps also
falsely to Pæonius. They say that nothing is more
common with vulgar cicerones than to attribute to
a great master any old work of uncertain origin.
Others, who will not proceed to such extremes, hold
that only the general design was made by the two
sculptors, and its execution handed over to local
artists. This may probably have been the case.
But I am disposed to infer from the overpraised
<hi rend='italic'>Niké</hi>, which certainly is the work of Pæonius, that
he was not an artist of the quality of the great Attic
school.<note place="foot">The student who desires to prosecute this difficult subject
should study Overbeck’s <hi rend='italic'>History of Greek Sculpture</hi>, or the works
of Mr. A. S. Murray, or Mr. Copeland Perry, on the same subject.</note> The whole external work of the temple
seems to represent a stage of art rather earlier and
ruder than the school of Phidias. This is eminently
the case with the Metopes, which can hardly be later
in date than 460 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>, or pre-Phidian in time.
</p>

<p>
Very different is the impression produced by the
greatest and most priceless gem of all the treasures
at Olympia—the Hermes of Praxiteles, which was
actually found on the very spot where it was seen
and described by Pausanias, fallen among the ruins
of the temple which originally protected it. This
exquisite figure, much smaller than life-size, represents
the god Hermes holding the infant Dionysus
on one arm, and showing the child some object now
lost. The right arm and the legs from below the
<pb n='314'/><anchor id='Pg314'/>knees are gone; the right foot with its sandal, an
exquisite piece of work with traces of gold and red,
has been recovered. It is remarkable that the back
of the statue is unfinished, and the child treated
rather as a doll than a human infant; the main
figure, however, now widely known through copies,
is the most perfect remnant of Greek art. The
temple in which the statue was found, the venerable
Heræon, is the most interesting of all the Olympian
buildings in its plan, and has solved for us
many problems in Greek architecture. The acute
researches of Dr. Dörpfeld have shown that the
walls were not of stone, but of sun-dried bricks,
and that the surrounding pillars had gradually replaced
older wooden pillars, one of which was still
there when Pausanias saw the building. The successive
stone pillars and their capitals were of the
same order, Doric, but varied in measurements and
profile according to the taste of the day. So then
this ancient building showed, like our English cathedrals,
the work of successive centuries in its restoration.
The roof and architrave were evidently of
wood, for all trace of these members has vanished;
but we learn from remains of the old <q>treasuries</q>
described by Pausanias that in very old times wood
and mud bricks were faced with colored terra cotta,
moulded to the required form, and that this ornament
was still used after stone had replaced bricks
and mud as the material of the walls and architrave.
<pb n='315'/><anchor id='Pg315'/>These curious details, and many others, have been
the main result of the architectural inquiries made
by the Germans into the archaic buildings at Olympia;
but it would be tedious to the reader of this
book were I to turn aside to discuss technical details.
He will find them all put with great clearness, and
indeed with elegance, in Bötticher’s <hi rend='italic'>Olympia</hi>. The
complete results of the excavations are now to be
found in the official work issued by the German
Government on the explorations.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, there only remains one very realistic
head of a boxer from a large class of monuments
at Olympia, that of the portrait statues of
victors at the games, of which one was even attributed
to Phidias, and several to Alkamenes, in Pausanias’s
time. All these were votive statues, set up
by victors at the games, or victors in war, and in
the early times were not portraits strictly speaking,
but ideal figures. Later on they became more realistic,
and were made in the likeness of the offerer, a
privilege said at one time only to have been accorded
to those who had won thrice at Olympia.
</p>

<p>
The commemoration of gymnastic victories by
these statues seems to have completely supplanted
the older fashion of triumphal odes, which in Pindar’s
day were so prized, and so dearly bought from
lyric poets. When these odes first came to be composed,
sculpture was still struggling with the difficulties
of human expression, and there was no one
<pb n='316'/><anchor id='Pg316'/>who would not feel the great artistic superiority of
Pindar’s verse to the cold stiffness of the archaic
reliefs of the same epoch, which attempt portraiture.
The portrait of Aristion by Aristokles, the similar
relief by Anxenor the Naxian, and the relief of the
discus thrower, are sufficient examples of what sculptured
portraits were in comparison with the rich
music of Simonides and Pindar. But while lyric
poetry passed into the higher service of tragedy, or
degenerated into the extravagance of the later
dithyramb, sculpture grew into such exquisite perfection,
and was of its very nature so enduring and
manifest, that the Olympic victor <sic>choose</sic> it as the
surest avenue to immortal fame. And so it was up
to Pausanias’s day, when every traveller could study
the records of the games at Olympia, or even admire
the most perfect of the statues in the palaces of
Roman Emperors, whither they were transferred.
</p>

<p>
But the day came when the poets were avenged
upon the sculptors. Olympia sank under general
decay and sudden catastrophe. Earthquakes and
barbarians ravaged its treasury, and while Pindar
was being preserved in manuscript, until his resurrection
in the days of printing, the invasion of the
Kladeus saved the scanty remains in the <hi rend='italic'>Altis</hi> from
destruction only by covering them with oblivion.
Now, in the day of its resurrection, pedestal after
pedestal with its votive inscription has been unearthed,
but, except the <hi rend='italic'>Niké</hi> of Pæonius, no actual
<pb n='317'/><anchor id='Pg317'/>votive statue had been recovered when I saw the
excavations, after two years of labor.
</p>

<p>
The river Alpheus, which has done such excellent
work in its inundations, does not confine itself
to concealing antiquities, but sometimes discovers
them. Its rapid course eats away the alluvial bank
which the waters have deposited ages ago, and thus
encroaches upon old tombs, from which various relics
are washed down in its turbid stream. The famous
helmet dedicated by Hiero, son of Deinomenes, was
discovered in the river in this way; and there is
also in the Ministry of Public Instruction a large
circular band of bronze, <hi rend='italic'>riveted</hi> together where the
ends meet, with very archaic zigzag and linear patterns,
which was found in the same way some twenty
years ago, and which seems to me of great interest,
as exhibiting a kind of workmanship akin to the
decorations in the Schliemann treasure of Mycenæ.
There is also a rude red earthen pot in the Turkish
house on the Acropolis at Athens, which is decorated
with the same kind of lines. It is very important
to point out these resemblances to travellers,
for there is such endless detail in Greek antiquities,
and so little has yet been classified, that every observation
may be of use to future students, even
though it may merely serve as a hint for closer
research.
</p>

<p>
The Stadium and Hippodrome, which lie farther
away from the river, and right under the conical
<pb n='318'/><anchor id='Pg318'/>hill called Kronion, have not yet, I believe, been
completely investigated; but they may no doubt
offer us some new and interesting evidences on the
management of the famous Olympian games.
</p>

<p>
These games were not at all what most people
imagine them to be. I will, therefore, delay the
reader with some details concerning this most interesting
side of old Greek life.
</p>

<p>
The establishment of games at Olympia was
assigned by the poets to mythical ages, and not
only is there a book of the Iliad devoted to funeral
games, but in Pindar’s eleventh Olympic Ode this
particular establishment is made coeval with the
labors of Herakles. Whether such evidence is
indeed conclusive may fairly be doubted. The
twenty-third book of the Iliad, which shows traces
of being a later portion of the poem, describes contests
widely differing from those at Olympia, and
the mythical founders enumerated by Pausanias
(v. 7) are so various and inconsistent that we can
see how obscure the question appeared to Greek
archæologists, even did we not find at the end of
the enumeration the following significant hint:—<q>But
after Oxylus—for Oxylus, too, established
the contest—after his reign it fell out of use till
the Olympiad of Iphitus,</q> that is to say, till the
first Ol., which is dated 776 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>, Oxylus being
the companion of the Herakleidæ, who obtained
Elis for his portion. Pausanias adds that when
<pb n='319'/><anchor id='Pg319'/>Iphitus renewed the contest, men had forgotten the
old arrangements, and only <hi rend='italic'>gradually came to remember
them</hi>, and whenever they recollected any special
competition they added it to the games. This is
the excellent man’s theory to account for the gradual
addition of long races, of wrestling, discus
throwing, boxing, and chariot racing, to the original
sprint race of about 200 yards, which was at
first the only known competition.

<p>
The facts seem to me rather to point to the late
growth of games in Greece, which may possibly
have begun as a local feast at Olympia in the eighth
century, but which only rose to importance during
the reign of the despots throughout Greece, when
the aristocrats were prevented from murdering one
another, and compelled to adopt more peaceful pursuits.<note place="foot">The fact that some of these public meetings are associated
with the fall of tyrants does not, I think, disprove what is here
advanced.</note>
It was in the end of the seventh and opening
of the sixth centuries that the Pythian, Nemean,
and Isthmian games show by their successive establishments
the rapid spread of the fashion, and a vast
number of local contests diffused through every district
in Greece the taste and the training for such
competitions.<note place="foot">I have not room here to give in full my reasons for rejecting
the earlier part of the Olympic register, as being the manufacture
of Hippias of Elis, later than 400 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi> But the reader who is
curious on the subject may either consult my article in the <hi rend='italic'>Journal
    of Hellenic Studies</hi> for 1881, or the appendix to my <hi rend='italic'>Problems in
Greek History</hi> (1892). He will then see that there is no direct
evidence whatever for any early list, and that the antiquarian
Pausanias, in his hunt after ancient monuments at Olympia,
could find nothing earlier than the so-called 33d Olympiad. Plutarch,
moreover, in the opening of his <hi rend='italic'>Life of Numa</hi>, tells us
plainly that the list was the manufacture of Hippias, <hi rend='italic'>and based
on no trustworthy evidence</hi>. To accept the list, therefore, in the face
of these objections, is to exhibit culpable credulity.</note> These games lasted all through
    clas<pb n='320'/><anchor id='Pg320'/>sical Greek history—the Olympian even down to
later times, for they were not abolished till nearly
1200 years (Ol. 294) had elapsed since their alleged
foundation. But the day of their real greatness was
gone long before. Cicero indignantly repudiates
the report that he had gone to see such games, just
as a pious earl, within our memory, repudiated the
report that he had attended the prize-fight between
Sayers and Heenan. The good generals of earlier
centuries, such as Alexander the Great and Philopœmen,
set their faces against athletics as bad training
for soldiers. Nay, even earlier, the Spartans,
though they could contend with success in the <hi rend='italic'>pentathlon</hi>,
when they choose, did not countenance the
fiercer competitions, as engendering bad feeling between
rivals, and, what was worse, compelling a
man to declare himself vanquished, and feel disgraced.
The Athenians also, as soon as the sophists
reformed education, began to rate intellectual wrestling
as far superior to any bodily exercise. Thus
the supremacy of Athens and Sparta over the other
<pb n='321'/><anchor id='Pg321'/>Greek cities in the fifth century marked, in my
opinion, the real turning-point in the Greek estimate
of athletics, and the fact that the great odes
of Pindar sing the glories of no Spartan, and only
twice, very briefly, those of Athenians, seems to
indicate that even then men began to think of more
serious rivalries and more exciting spectacles than
the festive meetings at Olympia. In the very next
generation the poets had drifted away from them,
and Euripides despises rather than admires them.
The historians take little notice of them.
</p>

<p>
Two circumstances only tended strongly to keep
them up. In the first place, musical competitions
(which had always been a part of the Pythian) and
poetical rivalries were added to the sports, which
were also made the occasion of mercantile business,
of social meetings, and not seldom of political agitation.
The wise responses of the Delphic oracle
were not a little indebted to the information gathered
from all parts of the Hellenic world at the
games, some important celebration of which, whether
at Nemea, the Isthmus, or the greater meetings,
occurred every year.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, if the art of poetry soon devoted itself
to the higher objects of tragedy, and created for
itself the conflict which it celebrated, the art of
sculpture became so closely connected with athletics
as to give them an æsthetic importance of the highest
kind all through Greek history. The ancient
<pb n='322'/><anchor id='Pg322'/>habit of setting up ideal statues of victors, which
were made special likenesses if the subject was specially
distinguished, supplied the Greeks with a
series of historical monuments and a series of physical
types not elsewhere to be matched, and thus
perhaps the most interesting part of Pausanias’s
invaluable guide-book to Greece is his collection of
notes (lib. vi., 1–20) on various statues set up in
this way at Olympia, of which he mentions about
two hundred, though he only professes to make a
selection, and though several of the finest had already
been carried off by Roman emperors.
</p>

<p>
These things kept alive the athletic meetings in
Greece, and even preserved for them some celebrity.
The sacred truce proclaimed during the national
games was of inestimable convenience in times of
long and bitter hostilities, and doubtless enabled
friends to meet who had else been separated for
life.<note place="foot">So also under the early Roman Empire the exiles on the
barren islands of the Ægean seem to have been allowed this indulgence.
Cf. the curious passage from Plutarch I have quoted and
explained in my <hi rend='italic'>Greek World under Roman Sway</hi>, p. 261.</note> But the Panathenaic festivals were better
exponents of fourth century taste in Greece. There
music and the drama predominated. Professional
displays became equally admired as a pastime and
despised as a profession; and I have no doubt that
the athlete who spent his life going about from one
contest to another in search of gymnastic triumphs
<pb n='323'/><anchor id='Pg323'/>was held in like contempt by Brasidas and by Cleon,
by Xenophon and by Agesilaus.
</p>

<p>
In the days of Solon things had been very different.
He appointed a reward of 500 drachmas,
then a very large sum, for victors at Olympia, 100
for those at the Isthmus, and for the others in proportion.
Pindar sings as if, to the aristocrats of Ægina,
or the tyrants of Sicily, no higher earthly prizes were
attainable. But we must not transfer these evidences—the
habit or the echo of the sixth century <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>—to
the days of political and educated Greece, when
public opinion altered very considerably on the advantage
and value of physical competition. This
being once understood, I will proceed to a short
analysis of the sports, and will attempt to criticise
the methods adopted by the old Greeks to obtain the
highest physical condition, the nature of the competitions
they established, and the results which they
appear to have attained.
</p>

<p>
The Greeks of Europe seem always to have been
aware that physical exercise was of the greatest importance
for health, and consequently for mental
vigor, and the earliest notices we have of education
include careful bodily training. Apart from the
games of children, which were much the same as
ours, there was not only <hi rend='italic'>orchestic</hi> or rhythmical dancing
in graceful figures, in which girls took part, and
which corresponded to what are now vulgarly called
<hi rend='italic'>callisthenics</hi>, but also gymnastics, in which boys were
<pb n='324'/><anchor id='Pg324'/>trained to those exercises which they afterward
practised as men. In addition to the <hi rend='italic'>palæstras</hi>,
which were kept for the benefit of boys as a matter
of private speculation in Athens, and probably in
other towns, regular <hi rend='italic'>gymnasia</hi> were established by
the civic authorities, and put under strict supervision
as state institutions to prevent either idleness or immorality.<note place="foot">The very stringent laws quoted by Æschines <hi rend='italic'>in Timarchum</hi>
may possibly be spurious, since we know from other allusions that
they were not enforced. But more probably they existed as a
dead letter, which could be revived if occasion required.</note>
In these gymnasia, where young men
came in the afternoon, stripped, oiled themselves,
and then got a coat of dust or fine sand over the
skin, running, wrestling, boxing, jumping, and
throwing with the dart were commonly practised.
</p>

<p>
This sort of physical training I conceive to have
grown up with the growth of towns, and with the
abandonment of hunting and marauding, owing to
the increase of culture. Among the aristocrats of
epical days, as well as among the Spartans, who
lived a village life, surrounded by forest and mountain,
I presume field sports must have been quite the
leading amusement; nor ought competitions in a
gymnasium to be compared for one moment to this
far higher and more varied recreation. The contrast
still subsists among us, and our fox-hunting,
salmon-fishing, grouse-shooting country gentleman
has the same inestimable advantage over the city
<pb n='325'/><anchor id='Pg325'/>athlete, whose special training for a particular event
has a necessary tendency to lower him into a professional.
There is even a danger of some fine
exercises, which seemed common ground for both,
such as boating and cricket, being vulgarized by
the invasion of this professional spirit, which implies
such attention to the body as to exclude higher pursuits,
and which rewards by special victories, and by
public applause rather than by the intrinsic pleasure
of sport for its own sake. Thus the Spartans not
only objected to boxing and the pankration, in which
the defeated competitor might have to ask for mercy;
they even for general purposes preferred field-sports,
for which they had ample opportunities, to any
special competitions in the strength of particular
muscles. But in such places as Athens and its
neighborhood, where close cultivation had caused all
wild country and all game to disappear, it was necessary
to supply the place of country sport by the
training of the gymnasium. This sort of exercise
naturally led to contests, so that for our purpose we
need not separate <hi rend='italic'>gymnastic</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>agonistic</hi>, but may
use the details preserved about the latter to tell us
how the Greeks practised the former.
</p>

<p>
There is no doubt that the pursuit of high muscular
condition was early associated with that of
health, and that hygiene and physical training were
soon discovered to be closely allied. Thus Herodicus,
a trainer, who was also an invalid, was said to
<pb n='326'/><anchor id='Pg326'/>have discovered from his own case the method of
treating disease by careful diet and regimen, and to
have thus contributed to the advancement of Greek
medicine. Pausanias also mentions (vi. 3, 9) the
case of a certain Hysmon, an Elean, who, when a
boy, had rheumatism in his limbs, and on this
account practised for the pentathlon, that he might
become a healthy and sound man. His training
made him not only sound, but a celebrated victor.
</p>

<p>
It would be very interesting to know in detail
what rules the Greeks prescribed for this purpose.
Pausanias tells us (vi. 7, 9) that a certain Dromeus,
who won ten victories in long races at various
games (about Ol. 74, 485 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>), was the first who
thought of eating meat in his training, for that up
to that time the diet of athletes had been cheese
from wicker baskets (<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἐκ τῶν ταλάρων</foreign>).<note place="foot">The modern Greeks make their cheese for keeping, even now,
in wicker baskets, and distinguish it from <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">χλωρὸς τύρος</foreign>, which now
means cream cheese, and which they carry to market in woollen
bags. There was a special market for it in Athens in Aristophanes’s
day, but not in woollen bags; for, as Mr. Pickering (of
Shrewsbury School) pointed out to me, the cream cheese of Aristophanes’s
day was kept in wicker work. I gladly here acknowledge
this correction of the note in my former edition.</note> It must be
remembered that meat diet was not common among
the Greeks, who, like most southern people, lived
rather upon fish, fruit, and vegetables, so that the
meat dinners of Bœotia were censured as heavy and
rather disgusting. However, the discovery of
<pb n='327'/><anchor id='Pg327'/>Dromeus was adopted by Greek athletes ever after,
and we hear of their compulsory meals of large
quantities of meat, and their consequent sleepiness
and sluggishness in ordinary life, in such a way as
to make us believe that the Greeks had missed the
real secret of training, and actually thought that the
more strong nutriment a man could take, the stronger
he would become. The quantity eaten by athletes
is universally spoken of as far exceeding the quantity
eaten by ordinary men, not to speak of its heavier
quality.
</p>

<p>
The suspicion that, in consequence, Greek athletic
performances were not in speed greater than, if even
equal to, our own, is however hard to verify, as we
are without any information as to the time in which
their running feats were performed. They had no
watches, or nice measures of short moments of time,
and always ran races merely to see who would win,
not to see in how short a time a given distance
could be done. Nevertheless, as the course was
over soft sand, and as the vases picture them rushing
along in spread-eagle fashion, with their arms
like the sails of a windmill—in order to aid the
motion of their bodies, as the Germans explain (after
Philostratos)—nay, as we even hear of their having
started shouting, if we can believe such a thing,
their time performances in running must have been
decidedly poor.<note place="foot">I should, however, call attention to an exceptional vase in the
little Turkish house on the Acropolis, probably of late date, in
which a runner is represented with his elbows back and hands
closed, and near his sides, in very good form.</note>
</p>

<p>
In the Olympic games the running, which had
originally been the only competition, always came
first. The distance was once up the course, and
seems to have been about 200 yards. After the
year 720 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi> (?) races of double the course, and
long races of about 3000 yards were added;<note place="foot">Pausanias is responsible for the date, which he probably copied
from Hippias of Elis. It is noted as a special wonder that the
same man should win the sprint and long races at Olympia, which
shows that the latter must have been mainly a test of staying
power. The Spartan Ladas died at the winning-post, and this
endurance was thought rather a wonderful feat, but of course his
death may have resulted from bad training, or from heart disease.</note> races
in armor were a later addition, and came at the end
of the sports. It is remarkable that among all these
varieties hurdle races were unknown, though the
long jump was assigned a special place, and thought
very important. We have several extraordinary
anecdotes of endurance in running long journeys
cited throughout Greek history, and even now the
modern inhabitants are remarkable for this quality.
I have seen a young man keep up with a horse
ridden at a good pace across rough country for many
miles, and have been told that the Greek postmen
are quite wonderful for their speed and lasting. But
this is compatible with very poor performances at
prize meetings.
</p>

<pb n='329'/><anchor id='Pg329'/>

<p>
There were short races for boys at Olympia of
half the course. Eighteen years was beyond the
limit of age for competing, as a story in Pausanias
implies, and a boy who won at the age of twelve
was thought wonderfully young. The same authority
tells us of a man who won the sprint race at four
successive meetings, thus keeping up his pace for
sixteen years—a remarkable case. There seems to
have been no second prize in any of the historical
games, a natural consequence of the abolition of
material rewards.<note place="foot"><q>Know ye not,</q> says St. Paul, <q>that all run, and <hi rend='italic'>one</hi> receiveth
the crown?</q>—a quite different condition of things from
that of the Iliad, where every competitor, like the boys at a private
school, comes off with a prize.</note> There was, naturally, a good
deal of chance in the course of the contest, and
Pausanias evidently knew cases where the winner
was not the best man. For example, the races were
run in heats of four, and if there was an odd man
over, the owner of the last lot drawn could sit down
till the winners of the heats were declared, and then
run against them without any previous fatigue. The
limitation of each heat to four competitors arose, I
fancy, from their not wearing colors (or even clothes),
and so not being easily distinguishable. They were
accordingly walked into the arena through an underground
passage in the raised side of the stadium,
and the name and country of each proclaimed in
order by a herald. This practice is accurately
<pb n='330'/><anchor id='Pg330'/>copied in the present Olympic games held at Athens
every four years.
</p>

<p>
The next event was the wrestling match, which is
out of fashion at our prize meetings, though still a
favorite sport in many country districts. There is a
very ample terminology for the various tricks and
devices in this contest, and they have been explained
with much absurdity by scholiasts, both ancient and
modern. It seems that it was not always enough to
throw your adversary,<note place="foot">Possibly this special sort of wrestling has been confused with
the <hi rend='italic'>pankration</hi>, from which it can have differed but little, if it
indeed subsisted permanently as a distinct form of wrestling.</note> but that an important part
of the sport was the getting uppermost on the
ground; and in no case was a man declared beaten
till he was thrown three times, and was actually laid
on his back. It is not worth while enumerating the
various technical terms, but it may be observed that
a good deal of what we should call foul play was
tolerated. There was no kicking, such as there
used to be in wrestling matches in Ireland, because
there were no boots, but Pausanias mentions (vi. 4,
3) a man who did not know how to wrestle, but defeated
his opponents by breaking their fingers. We
shall return to this point when speaking of the <hi rend='italic'>pankration</hi>.
</p>

<p>
When the wrestling was over there followed the
throwing of the discus and the dart, and the long
leap, but in what order is uncertain; for I cannot
<pb n='331'/><anchor id='Pg331'/>accept as evidence the pentameter line of Simonides,
which enumerates the games of the pentathlon, seeing
that it would be impossible to vary them from the
order he gives without great metrical difficulties.
Our only safe guide is, I think, the date of the
origin of each kind of competition, as it was plainly
the habit of the Greeks to place the new event next
after those already established. The sole exception
to this is in the establishing of contests for boys,
which seem always to have come immediately before
the corresponding competition for men. But
we are only told that both wrestling and the contest
of five events (pentathlon) dated from the 18th Ol.
(710 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>), and are not informed in what order each
was appointed.<note place="foot">The single competitions in running and wrestling were distinct
from those in the pentathlon, and rewarded by separate crowns.</note>

<p>
The discus-throwing was mainly to test distance,
but the dart-throwing to strike a mark. The discus
was either of stone or of metal, and was very heavy.
I infer from the attitude of Myron’s discobolus, as
seen in our copies, that it was thrown without a preliminary
run, and rather hurled standing. This contest
is to be compared with our hammer-throwing,
or putting of weights. We are, however, without
any accurate information either as to the average
weight of the discus, or the average distance which
a good man could throw it. There is, indeed, one
ancient specimen extant, which was found at Ægina,
<pb n='332'/><anchor id='Pg332'/>and is now preserved among the bronze antiquities
at Munich. It is about eight inches in diameter,
and something under four pounds in weight. But
there seem to have been three sizes of discus, according
as they were intended for boys, for grown
youths (<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἀγένειοι</foreign>), or for men, and it is not certain to
which class this discus belongs. Philostratos mentions
one hundred cubits as a fine throw, but in such
a way as to make it doubtful whether he is not talking
at random and in round numbers. Similarly,
we have no details concerning the javelin contest.
But I suspect that here, if anywhere, the Greeks
could do what we cannot; for the savages of to-day,
who use spears, can throw them with a force and
accuracy which is to us quite surprising. It is reported
by trustworthy travellers that a Kaffir who
comes suddenly on game will put a spear right into
an antelope at ten or twelve yards’ distance by an
underhand chuck, without taking time to raise his
arm. This is beyond the ability of any English
athlete, however trained.
</p>

<p>
The question of the long jump is more interesting,
as it still forms a part of our contests. It is not certain
whether the old Greeks practised the running jump,
or the high jump, for we never hear of a preliminary
start, or of any difficulty about <q>breaking trig,</q> as
people now call it. Furthermore, an extant epigram
on a celebrated athlete, Phayllus of Kroton, asserts
that he jumped clean over the prepared ground (which
<pb n='333'/><anchor id='Pg333'/>was broken with a spade) on to the hard ground
beyond—a distance of forty-nine feet. We cannot,
of course, though some German professors believe
it, credit this feat, if it were a single long jump, yet
we can find no trace of anything like a hop, step, and
jump, so that it seems wonderful how such an absurdity
should be gravely repeated in an epigram.
But the exploit became proverbial, and to leap
<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ὑπὲρ τὰ σκάμματα</foreign> (beyond the digging) was a constantly
repeated phrase.
</p>

<p>
The length of Phayllus’s leap would be even more
incredible if the competition was in a standing jump,
and yet the figures of athletes on vases which I have
seen strongly favor this supposition. They are represented
not as running, but as standing and swinging
the dumb-bells or <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἁλτῆρες</foreign> (jumpers), which were
always used by the older Greeks, as assisting them
materially in increasing their distance. I can imagine
this being the case in a standing jump where a
man rose with the forward swing of the weights, but
in a running jump the carrying of the weights must
surely impede rather than assist him. I know that
Irish peasants, who take off very heavy boots to
jump, often carry one in each hand, and throw them
backward violently as they rise from the ground;
but this principle is not admitted so far as I know,
by any scientific authority, as of the slightest assistance.
</p>

<p>
We hear of no vaulting or jumping with a pole,
<pb n='334'/><anchor id='Pg334'/>so that in fact the leap seems an isolated contest, and
of little interest except as determining one of the
events of the pentathlon, in which a man must win
three in order to be declared victor. This pentathlon,
as comprising gentlemanly exercise without
much brutality, was especially patronized by the
Spartans. It was attempted for boys, but immediately
abandoned, the strain being thought excessive for
growing constitutions.
</p>

<p>
There remain the two severest and most objectionable
sports—boxing and the pankration. The
former came first (Ol. 23), the other test of strength
not being admitted till Ol. 33 (650 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>). But one
special occasion is mentioned when a champion, who
was competing in both, persuaded the judges to
change the order, that he might not have to contend
against a specially famous antagonist when already
wounded and bruised. For boxing was, even from
Homeric times, a very dangerous and bloody amusement,
in which the vanquished were always severely
punished. The Greeks were not content with naked
fists, but always used a special apparatus, called
<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἱμάντες</foreign>, which consisted at first of a weight carried
in the hand, and fastened by thongs of hide round
the hand and wrist. But this ancient cestus came
to be called the gentle kind (<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">μειλίχαι</foreign>) when a later
and more brutal invention introduced <q>sharp thongs
on the wrist,</q> and probably increased the weight of
the instrument. The successful boxer in the Iliad
<pb n='335'/><anchor id='Pg335'/>(Epeius) confesses that he is a bad warrior, though
he is the acknowledged champion in his own line;
but evidently this sport was not highly esteemed in
epic days. In historical times it seems to have been
more favored. There was no doubt a great deal of
skill required for it, but I think the body of the evidence
goes to prove that the Greeks did not box on
sound principles, and that any prominent member
of the P. R. with his naked fists would have easily
settled any armed champion of Olympian fame.
Here are my reasons:
</p>

<p>
The principle of increasing the weight of the fist
as much as possible is only to be explained by the
habit of dealing swinging or downward strokes, and
is incompatible with the true method of striking
straight home quickly, and giving weight to the
stroke by sending the whole body with it. In Vergil’s
description a boxer is even described getting up on
tip-toe to strike his adversary on the top of the head—a
ridiculous manœuvre, which must make his instant
ruin certain, if his opponent knew the first
elements of the art. That this downward stroke
was used appears also from the anecdote in Pausanias,
where a father seeing his son, who was
ploughing, drive in the share which had fallen out
with strokes of his fist, without a hammer, immediately
entered him for the boys’ boxing match at
Olympia. The lad got roughly handled from want
of skill, and seemed likely to lose, when the father
<pb n='336'/><anchor id='Pg336'/>called out: <q>Boy, give him the plough stroke!</q> and
so encouraged him that he forthwith knocked his
adversary out of time.
</p>

<p>
It is almost conclusive as to the swinging stroke
that throughout antiquity a boxer was not known as
a man with his nose broken, but as a man <hi rend='italic'>with his
ears crushed</hi>. Vergil even speaks of their receiving
blows on the back. Against all this there are only
two pieces of evidence—one of them incredible—in
favor of the straight home stroke. In the fight
between Pollux and Amykos, described by Theocritus
(<hi rend='italic'>Idyll</hi> 22), Pollux strikes his man on the left
temple, <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">καὶ ἐπέμπεσεν ὤμῳ</foreign>, which may mean, <q>and
follows up the stroke from the shoulder.</q> But this
is doubtful. The other is the story of Pausanias
(viii. 40, 3), that when Kreugas and Damoxenos
boxed till evening, and neither could hit the other,
they at last agreed to receive stroke about, and after
Kreugas had dealt Damoxenos one on the head, the
latter told him to hold up his hand,<note place="foot">This is the moment chosen by Canova in his celebrated representation
of these boxers in the Vatican, a fact of which I was
ignorant till it was pointed out to me, in correcting an error I had
made about them, by Mr. M’D. Campbell, of Glasgow.</note> and then drove
his fingers right into Kreugas, beneath the ribs, and
pulled out his entrails. Kreugas of course died on
the spot, but was crowned as victor, on the ground
that Damoxenos had broken his agreement of striking
<hi rend='italic'>one</hi> blow in turn, by striking him with five
    sep<pb n='337'/><anchor id='Pg337'/>arate fingers! But this curious decision was only
one of many in which a boxing competitor was disqualified
for having fought with the intention of
maiming his antagonist.
</p>

<p>
Little need be added about the pankration, which
combined boxing and wrestling, and permitted every
sort of physical violence except biting. In this contest
a mere fall did not end the affair, as might happen
in wrestling, but the conflict was always continued
on the ground, and often ended in one of the
combatants being actually choked, or having his
fingers and toes broken. One man, Arrachion, at
the last gasp, broke his adversary’s toe, and made
him give in, at the moment he was himself dying
of strangulation. Such contests were not to the
credit either of the humanity or of the good taste
of the Greeks, and would not be tolerated even in
the lowest of our prize rings.
</p>

<p>
I will conclude this sketch by giving some account
of the general management of the prize meetings.
</p>

<p>
There was no want of excitement and of circumstance
about them. In the case of the four great
meetings there was even a public truce proclaimed,
and the competitors and visitors were guaranteed
a safe journey to visit them and to return to their
homes. The umpires at the Olympic games were
chosen ten months before at Elis, and seem to have
numbered one for each clan, varying through Greek
history from two to twelve, but finally fixed at ten.
<pb n='338'/><anchor id='Pg338'/>They were called both here and at the other great
games <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">Ἑλλανοδίκαι</foreign>, judges of the Hellenes, in
recognition of their national character. Three
superintended the pentathlon, three the horse races,
and the rest the other games. They had to reside
together in a public building, and undergo strict
training in all the details of their business, in
which they were assisted by heralds, trumpeters,
stewards, etc. Their office was looked upon as of
much dignity and importance.
</p>

<p>
When the great day came, they sat in purple
robes in the semicircular end of the racecourse—a
piece of splendor which the modern Greeks imitate
by dressing the judges of the new Olympic games
in full evening dress and white kid gloves. The
effect even now with neatly-clothed candidates is
striking enough; what must it have been when
a row of judges in purple looked on solemnly at
a pair of men dressed in oil and dust—<hi rend='italic'>i. e.</hi>, in mud—wrestling
or rolling upon the ground? The crowd
cheered and shouted as it now does. Pausanias
mentions a number of cases where competitors were
disqualified for unfairness, and in most of them the
man’s city took up the quarrel, which became quite
a public matter; but at the games the decision was
final, nor do we hear of a case where it was afterward
reversed.<note place="foot">The first case of cheating was said to have taken place in the
98th Ol. (388 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>), when the Thessalian Eupolos was convicted of
bribing the three boxers opposed to him, one of whom had won at
the previous meeting. Such crimes were commemorated by bronze
figures of Zeus (called <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">Ζᾶνες</foreign> at Elis), which were of the value of
the fines inflicted, and had inscriptions warning all athletes of the
dangers and the disgrace of cheating.</note> They were also obliged to exact
<pb n='339'/><anchor id='Pg339'/>beforehand from each candidate an oath that he was
of pure Hellenic parentage, that he had not taken,
or would not take, any unfair advantage, and that
he had spent ten months in strict training. This
last rule I do not believe. It is absurd in itself, and
is contradicted by such anecdotes as that of the
sturdy plough-boy quoted above, and still more
directly by the remark of Philostratos (<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">Γυμν.</foreign> 38),
who ridicules any inquiry into the morals or training
of an athlete by the judges. Its only meaning could
have been to exclude random candidates, if the
number was excessive, and in later times some such
regulation may have subsisted, but I do not accept
it for the good classical days. There is the case of
a boy being rejected for looking too young and
weak, and winning in the next Olympiad among
the men, But in another instance the competitor
disqualified (for unfairness) went mad with disappointment.
Aristotle notes that it was the rarest
possible occurrence for a boy champion to turn out
successful among the full-grown athletes, but Pausanias
seems to contradict him, a fair number of cases
being cited among the selection which he makes.
</p>

<p>
There is yet one unpleasant feature to be noted,
<pb n='340'/><anchor id='Pg340'/>which has disappeared from our sports. Several
allusions make it plain that the vanquished, even
vanquished boys, were regarded as fit subjects for
jibe and ridicule, and that they sneaked home by
lanes and backways. When the most ideal account
which we have of the games gives us this information,
we cannot hesitate to accept it as probably
a prominent feature, which is, moreover, thoroughly
consistent with the character of the old Greeks as
I conceive it.<note place="foot">The reader will find some illustrations of it in my <hi rend='italic'>Social
Greece</hi>, 6th edition, p. 96.</note>
</p>

<p>
The general conclusion to which all these details
lead us is this, that with all the care and with all the
pomp expended on Greek athletic meetings, despite
the exaggerated fame attained by victors, and the
solid rewards both of money and of privileges accorded
them by their grateful country, the results attained
physically seem to have been inferior to those of
English athletes. There was, moreover, an element
of brutality in them, which is very shocking to modern
notions: and not all the ideal splendor of Pindar’s
praises, or of Pythagoras’s art, can raise the Greek
pankratiast as an athlete much above the level of
a modern prize-fighter. But, nevertheless, by the
aid of their monumental statues, their splendid lyric
poetry, and the many literary and musical contests
which were combined with the gymnastic, the Greeks
contrived, as usual, to raise very common things to
<pb n='341'/><anchor id='Pg341'/>a great national manifestation of culture which we
cannot hope to equal.
</p>

<p>
For common they were, and very human, in the
strictest sense. Dry-as-dust scholars would have
us believe that the odes of Pindar give a complete
picture of these games; as if all the booths about
the course had not been filled with idlers, pleasure-mongers,
and the scum of Greek society! Tumbling,
thimble-rigging, and fortune-telling, along with
love-making and trading, made Olympia a scene
not unlike the Derby. When the drinking parties
of young men began in the evening, there may even
have been a <hi rend='italic'>soupçon</hi> of Donnybrook Fair about it,
but that the committee of management were probably
strict in their discipline. From the Isthmian
games the successful athletes, with their training
over, retired, as most athletes do, to the relaxation
afforded by city amusements. One can imagine
how amply Corinth provided for the outburst of
liberty after the long and arduous subjection of
physical training.
</p>

<p>
But all these things are perhaps justly forgotten,
and it is ungrateful to revive them from oblivion.
The dust and dross of human conflict, the blood and
the gall, the pain and the revenge—all this was laid
aside like the athlete’s dress, and could not hide the
glory of his naked strength and his iron endurance.
The idleness and vanity of human admiration have
vanished with the motley crowd, and have left us
<pb n='342'/><anchor id='Pg342'/>free to study the deeper beauty of human vigor
with the sculptor, and the spiritual secrets of its
hereditary origin with the poet. Thus Greek gymnastic,
with all its defects—perhaps even with its
absurdities—has done what has never been even
the dream of its modern sister; it stimulated the
greatest artists and the highest intellects in society,
and through them ennobled and purified public taste
and public morals.

When we left Olympia, and began to ascend the
course of the Alpheus, the valley narrowed to the
broad bed of the stream. The way leads now along
the shady slopes high over the river, now down in
the sandy flats left bare in the summer season.
There are curious zones of vegetation distinctly
marked along the course of the valley. On the
river bank, and in the little islands formed by the
stream, are laurels, myrtles, and great plane-trees.
On the steep and rocky slopes are thick coverts of
mastich, arbutus, dwarf-holly, and other evergreens
which love to clasp the rocks with their roots; and
they are all knit together by great creeping plants,
the wild vine, the convolvulus, and many that are
new and nameless to the northern stranger. On
the heights, rearing their great tops against the
sky, are huge pine-trees, isolated and still tattered
with the winter storms.

Travellers going from Olympia northward either
go round by carriage through Elis to Patras—a drive
of two days—or by Kalavryta to Megaspilion, and
thence to Vostitza, thus avoiding the great Alps of
Olonos (as Erymanthus is now called) and Chelmos,
which are among the highest and most picturesque
in Greece. After my last visit to Olympia (1884)
I was so tantalized by the perpetual view of the
snowy crest of Olonos, that I determined to attempt
a new route, not known to any of the guide-books,<note place="foot">It has been since inserted from my notes in the English translation
of Bædeker’s <hi rend='italic'>Greece</hi>.</note>
and cross over the mountain, as directly as I could,
from Olympia to Patras. It was easy for me to
carry out this plan, being accompanied by a young
Greek antiquarian, M. Castroménos, and by Dr.
Purgold from Olympia, who had travelled through
most of Greece, but was as anxious as I was to try
this new route.
</p>

<p>
So we started on a beautiful spring morning, up
the valley of the Kladeos, with all the trees bursting
into leaf and blossom, and the birds singing their
hymns of delight. The way was wooded, and led
<pb n='344'/><anchor id='Pg344'/>up through narrow and steep, but not difficult glens,
until, on a far higher level, we came in three or
four hours to the village of Lala, once an important
Turkish fort. Here was a higher plain, from which
we began to see the plan of that vast complex of
mountains which form the boundaries of the Old
Elis, Achaia, and Arcadia, and which have so often
been the scenes of difficult campaigns. From Lala,
where we breakfasted, we crossed a sudden deep
valley, and found ourselves, on regaining the higher
level, in a vast oak forest, unlike anything I had yet
seen in Greece. The trees had been undisturbed
for centuries, and the forest was even avoided in
summer by the natives, on account of the many poisonous
snakes which hid in the deep layers of dead
leaves. In that high country the oaks were just
turning pink with their new buds, and not a green
leaf was to be seen, so we could trust to the winter
sleep of the snakes, while we turned aside again and
again from our path, to the great perplexity of the
muleteers, to dig up wood anemones of all colors,
pale blue, pink, deep crimson, scarlet, snowy-white,
which showed brilliantly on the brown oak-leaf
carpet.
</p>

<p>
We spent at least two hours in riding through this
forest, and then we rose higher and higher, passing
along the upper edge of deep glens, with rushing
streams far beneath us. The most beautiful point
was one from which we looked down a vast straight
<pb n='345'/><anchor id='Pg345'/>glen of some fifteen miles, almost as deep as a cañon,
with the silvery Erymanthus river pursuing its
furious course so directly as to be clearly visible
all the way. But though ascending the river from
this point, where its course comes suddenly round a
corner, the upper country was no longer wooded,
but bleak, like most of the Alpine Arcadia, a country
of dire winters and great hardship to the population,
who till an unwilling soil on the steep slopes of giant
precipices.
</p>

<p>
We were much tempted to turn up another tortuous
glen to the hidden nest of Divri, where the
Greeks found refuge from Turkish prosecution in
the great war—a place so concealed, and so difficult
of access, that an armed force has never penetrated
there. But the uncertainties of our route were too
many to admit of these episodes, so we hurried on
to reach the Kahn of Tripotamo in the evening—a
resting-place which suggested to us strongly the inn
where St. John is reported to have slept in the
apocryphal <hi rend='italic'>Acts</hi> of his life. Being very tired with
preaching and travelling, he found it so impossible
to share the room with the bugs, that he besought
them in touching language to allow him to sleep;
practically in virtue of his apostolic authority, he
ordered them out of the house. They all obeyed,
but when in the morning the apostle and his companions
found them waiting patiently outside the
door, he was so moved by their consideration for
<pb n='346'/><anchor id='Pg346'/>him, that he permitted them to return and infest the
house.
</p>

<p>
Nor were the bugs perhaps the worst. Being
awakened by a crunching noise in the night, I perceived
that a party of cats had come in to finish our
supper for us, and when startled by a flying boot,
they made our beds and bodies the stepping stones
for a leap to the rafters, and out through a large
hole in the roof. By and by I was aroused by the
splashing of cold water in my face, and found that a
heavy shower had come on, and was pouring through
the cats’ passage. So I put up my umbrella in bed
till the shower was over—the only time I felt rain
during the whole of that voyage. I notice that Miss
Agnes Smith, who travelled through these parts in
May, 1883, and had very similar experiences at Tripotamo,
was wet through almost every day. We
did not see more than two showers, and were moreover
so fortunate as to have perfectly calm days
whenever we were crossing high passes, though in
general the breeze was so strong as to be almost
stormy in the valleys.
</p>

<p>
Next morning we followed the river up to the
neighboring site of Psophis, so picturesquely described
by Polybius in his account of Philip V., and
his campaigns in Elis and Triphylia.<note place="foot">Polybius, iv. 70.</note> This town,
regarded as the frontier-town of Elis, Arcadia, and
Achaia, would well repay an enterprising excavator.
<pb n='347'/><anchor id='Pg347'/>The description of Polybius can be verified without
difficulty, and ruins are still visible. We found out
from a solitary traveller that our way turned to the
north, up one of the affluents of the Erymanthus,
and so we ascended in company with this worthy
man to a village (Lechouri) under the highest precipices
of Olonos. He was full of the curiosity of a
Greek peasant—Who were we, where did we come
from, were we married, had we children, how many,
what was our income, was it from land, was it paid
by the State, could we be dismissed by the Government,
were we going to write about Greece, what
would we say, etc., etc.? Such was the conversation
to which we submitted for the sake of his
guidance. But at last it seemed as if our way was
actually at an end, and we had come into an impassable
<hi rend='italic'>cul-de-sac</hi>. Perpendicular walls of rock
surrounded us on all sides except where we had
entered by constantly fording the stream, or skirting
along its edge. Was it possible that the curiosity of
our fellow-traveller had betrayed him into leading us
up this valley to the village whither he himself was
bound? We sought anxiously for the answer, when
he showed us a narrow strip of dark pine-trees coming
down from above, in form like a little torrent, and
so reaching with a narrow thread of green to the
head of the valley. This was our pass, the pine-trees
with their roots and stems made a zigzag path
up the almost perpendicular wall possible, and so we
<pb n='348'/><anchor id='Pg348'/>wended our way up with infinite turnings, walking
or rather climbing for safety’s sake, and to rest the
laboring mules. Often as I had before attempted
steep ascents with horses in Greece, I never saw
anything so astonishing as this.
</p>

<p>
When we had reached the top we found ourselves
on a narrow saddle, with snowy heights close to us
on both sides, the highest ridge of Olonos facing us
a few miles away, and a great pine forest reaching
down on the northern side, whither our descent was
to lead us. About us were still great patches of
snow, and in them were blowing the crocus and the
cyclamen, with deep blue scilla. Far away to the
south reached, in a great panorama, the mountains
of Arcadia, and even beyond them the highest
tops of Messene and Laconia were plainly visible.
The air was clear, the day was perfectly fine and
calm. To the north the chain of Erymanthus still
hid from us the far distance. For a long time, while
our muleteers slept and the mules and ponies rested,
we sat wondering at the great view. The barometer
indicated that we were at a height of about 5500
feet. The freshness and purity of the atmosphere
was such that no thought of hunger and fatigue
could mar our perfect enjoyment. In the evening,
descending through gloomy pines and dazzling snow,
we reached the village of Hagios Vlasos, where the
song of countless nightingales beguiled the hours of
the night, for here too sleep was not easily obtained.
</p>

<pb n='349'/><anchor id='Pg349'/>

<p>
The journey from this point to Patras, which we
accomplished in twelve hours, is not so interesting,
and the traveller who tries it now had better telegraph
for a carriage to meet him as far as possible
on the way. By this time a good road is finished
for many miles, and the tedium and heat of the
plain, as you approach Patras, are very trying.
But with this help, I think no journey in all Greece
so well worth attempting, and of course it can be
accomplished in either direction.
</p>

<p>
Patras is indeed an excellent place for a starting-point.
Apart from the route just described, you can
go by boat to Vostitza, and thence to Megaspilion.
There are, moreover, splendid alpine ascents to be
made for those who like such work, to the summits
of Chelmos and Olonos (Erymanthus), and this is
best done from Patras. Moreover, Patras is itself a
most lovely place, commanding a noble view of the
coast and mountains of Ætolia across the narrow
fiord, as well as of the Ionian islands to the N. W.
Right opposite is the ever-interesting site of Missolonghi.
Last, and perhaps not least, there is at
Patras a most respectable inn, indeed I should call
it a hotel,<note place="foot">By this time (1891) there are probably three or four rivals,
which the traveller will see noted in his guide-book, provided he
does not depend on the <hi rend='italic'>Guide Joanne</hi>, which neglects to give such
information. The house to which I allude in the text is the
Hotel S. George.</note> where the traveller who has spent ten
<pb n='350'/><anchor id='Pg350'/>days of rough outing in Peloponnesus will find a
haven of rest and comfort. From here steamers
will carry him to Athens round the coast, or home
to Italy.

<p>
There is no name in Greece which raises in the
mind of the ordinary reader more pleasing and more
definite ideas than the name Arcadia. It has become
indissolubly connected with the charms of pastoral
ease and rural simplicity. The sound of the
shepherd’s pipe and the maiden’s laughter, the rustling
of shady trees, the murmuring of gentle fountains,
the bleating of lambs and the lowing of oxen—these
are the images of peace and plenty which
the poets have gathered about that ideal retreat.
There are none more historically false, more unfounded
in the real nature and aspect of the country,
and more opposed to the sentiment of the ancients.
Rugged mountains and gloomy defiles, a
harsh and wintry climate, a poor and barren soil,
tilled with infinite patience; a home that exiled its
children to seek bread at the risk of their blood, a
climate more opposed to intelligence and to culture
than even Bœotian fogs, a safe retreat of bears and
wolves—this is the Arcadia of old Greek history.
Politically it has no weight whatever till the days
<pb n='352'/><anchor id='Pg352'/>of Epaminondas, and the foundation of Megalopolis.
Intellectually, its rise is even later, and it takes no
national part in the great march of literature from
Homer to Menander.<note place="foot">This is not contradicted by the fact of there being isolated
Arcadian poets, such as Echembrotus and Aristarchus, distinguished
in foreign schools of art.</note> It was only famed for the
marketable valor of its hardy mountaineers, of whom
the Tegeans had held their own even against the
power of Sparta, and obtained an honorable place in
her army. It was also noted for rude and primitive
cults, of which later men praised the simplicity and
homely piety—at times also, the stern gloominess,
which did not turn from the offering of human
blood.
</p>

<p>
I must remind the reader that rural beauty among
the ancients, as well as among the Renaissance visions
of an imaginary Arcadia as a rustic paradise,
by no means included the wild picturesqueness
which we admire in beetling cliffs and raging torrents.
These were inhospitable and savage to the
Greeks. It was the gentle slope, the rich pasture,
the placid river framed in deep foliage—it was,
in fact, landscape-scenery like the valleys of the
Thames, or about the gray abbeys of Yorkshire,
which satisfied their notion of perfect landscape;
and in this the men of the Renaissance were perfectly
agreed with them.
</p>

<p>
How, then, did the false notion of our Arcadia
<pb n='353'/><anchor id='Pg353'/>spring up in modern Europe? How is it that even
our daily papers assume this sense, and know it to
be intelligible to the most vulgar public? The history
of the change from the historical to the poetical
conception is very curious, and worth the trouble of
explaining, especially as we find it assumed in many
books, but accounted for in none.
</p>

<p>
It appears that from the oldest days the worship
of Pan had its home in Arcadia, particularly about
Mount Mænalus, and that it was already ancient
when it was brought to Athens at the time of the
Persian Wars. The extant Hymn to Pan, among
the Homeric Hymns, which may have been composed
shortly after that date, is very remarkable
for its idyllic and picturesque tone, and shows that
with this worship of Pan were early associated those
trains of nymphs and rustic gods, with their piping
and dance, which inspired Praxiteles’s inimitable
Faun. These images are even transferred by Euripides
to the Acropolis, where he describes the
daughters of Aglauros dancing on the sward, while
Pan is playing his pipe in the grotto underneath
(<hi rend='italic'>Ion</hi>, vv. 492, <hi rend='italic'>sqq.</hi>). Such facts seem to show a
gentle and poetical element in the stern and gloomy
mountaineers, who lived, like the Swiss of our day,
in a perpetual struggle with nature, and were all
their lives harassed with toil and saddened with
thankless fatigue. This conclusion is sustained by
the evidence of a far later witness, Polybius, who
<pb n='354'/><anchor id='Pg354'/>in his fourth book mentions the strictness with which
the Arcadians insisted upon an education in music,
as necessary to soften the harshness and wildness of
their life. He even maintains that the savagery of
one town (Kynætha) was caused by a neglect of this
salutary precaution. So it happens that, although
Theocritus lays his pastoral scenes in the uplands
of Sicily, and the later pastoral romances, such as
the exquisite <hi rend='italic'>Daphnis and Chloe</hi>, are particularly
associated with the voluptuous Lesbos, Vergil, in
several of his <hi rend='italic'>Eclogues</hi>, makes allusion to the musical
talent of Arcadian shepherds, and in his tenth
brings the unhappy Gallus into direct relation to
Arcadia in connection with the worship of Pan on
Mænalus. But this prominent feature in Vergil—borrowed,
I suppose, from some Greek poet, though
I know not from whom—bore no immediate fruit.
His Roman imitators, Calpurnius and Nemesianus,
make no mention of Arcadia, and if they had, their
works were not unearthed till the year 1534, when
the poetical Arcadia had been already, as I shall
show, created. There seems no hint of the idea in
early Italian poetry;<note place="foot">The <hi rend='italic'>Eclogues</hi> of Petrarch are modelled upon those of Vergil
to the exclusion of the most characteristic features borrowed by
the latter from Theocritus.</note> for according to the histories
of mediæval literature, the pastoral romance did not
originate until the very end of the fourteenth century,
with the Portuguese Ribeyro, and he lays all
<pb n='355'/><anchor id='Pg355'/>the scenes of his idylls not in a foreign country, but
in Portugal, his own home. Thus we reach the year
1500 without any trace of a poetical Arcadia. But
at that very time it was being created by the single
work of a single man. The celebrated Jacopo Sannazaro,
known by the title of Actius Sincerus in the
affected society of literary Naples, exiled himself
from that city in consequence of a deep and unrequited
passion. He lay concealed for a long time,
it is said, in the wilds of France, possibly in Egypt,
but certainly not in Greece, and immortalized his
grief in a pastoral medley of prose description and
idyllic complaint called <hi rend='italic'>Arcadia</hi>,<note place="foot"><p>The following extract from the first prose piece of the book
will show how absolutely imaginary is his Arcadia, with its impossible
combination of trees, and its absence of winter:—</p>
    <p><q>Giace nella sommità di Partenio, non umile monte della pastorale
Arcadia, un dilettevole piano, di ampiezza non molto spazioso,
peroche il sito del luogo non consente, ma di minuta e
verdissima erbetta sì ripieno, che, se le lascive pecorelle con gli
avidi morsi non vi pasceresso, vi si potrebbe d’ogni tempo ritrovare
verdura. Ove, se io non m’inganno, son forse dodici o quindici
alberi di tanto strana ed eccessiva bellezza, che chiunque le vedesse,
giudicherebbe che la maestra natura vi si fosse con sommo
diletto studiata in formarli. Li quali alquanto distanti, ed in
ordine non artificioso disposti, con la loro rarità la naturale bellezza
del luogo oltra misura annobiliscono. Quivi senza nodo
veruno si vede il dritissimo abete, nato a sostenere i pericoli del
mare; e con più aperti rami la robusta quercia, e l’alto frassino,
e lo amenissimo platano vi si distendano, con le loro ombre non
picciola parte del bello e copioso prato occupando; ed evvi con
più breve fronda l’albero, di che Ercole coronare si solea, nel cui
pedale le misere figliuole di Climene furono trasformate: ed in un
de’ lati si scerne il noderoso castagno, il fronzuto bosco, e con puntate
foglie lo eccelso pino carico di durissimi frutti; nell’ altro
l’ombroso faggio, la incorruttibile tiglia, il fragile tamarisco, insieme
con la orientale palma, dolci ed onorato premio dei vincitori.
Ma fra tutti nel mezzo, presso un chiaro fonte, sorge verso
il cielo un dritto cipresso,</q> etc., etc. The work is, moreover, full
of direct imitations of Vergil, not, I fancy, of Theocritus also, as
the Italian commentators suppose, for that poet was not adequately
printed till 1495, which must have been very near the date of the
actual composition of the <hi rend='italic'>Arcadia</hi>.</p></note> and suggested, I
<pb n='356'/><anchor id='Pg356'/>believe, by the Gallus of Vergil. Though the
learned and classical author despised this work in
comparison with his heroic poem on the Conception
of the Virgin Mary, the public of the day thought
differently. Appearing in 1502, the <hi rend='italic'>Arcadia</hi> of
Sannazaro went through sixty editions during the
century, and so this single book created that imaginary
home of innocence and grace which has ever
since been attached to the name. Its occurrence
henceforward is so frequent as to require no further
illustration in this place.
</p>

<p>
But let us turn from this poetical and imaginary
country to the real land—from Arcádia to Arcadía,
as it is called by the real inhabitants. As everybody
knows, this Arcadia is the alpine centre of the
Morea, bristling with mountain chains, which reach
their highest points in the great bar of Erymanthus,
to the N. W., in the lonely peak of <q>Cyllene hoar,</q>
to the N. E., in the less conspicuous, but far more
sacred Lykæon, to the S. W., and finally, in the
ser<pb n='357'/><anchor id='Pg357'/>rated Taygetus to the S. E. These four are the angles,
as it were, of a quadrilateral enclosing Arcadia. Yet
these are but the greatest among chains of great
mountains, which seem to traverse the country in
all directions, and are not easily distinguished, or
separated into any connected system.<note place="foot">It is worth noting that the Arcadian vision in the <hi rend='italic'>Shepherd of
Hermas</hi>, describing a scene of twelve mountains of varied and contrasted
aspect, though intended for an allegorical purpose, is really
faithful to nature, and suggests that the author knew something of
the country he describes.</note> They are
nevertheless interrupted, as we found, by two fine
oval plains—both stretching north and south, both
surrounded with a beautiful panorama of mountains,
and both, of course, the seats of the old culture, such
as it was in Arcadia. That which is southerly and
westerly, and from which the rivers still flow into the
Alpheus and the western sea,<note place="foot">Pausanias places the source of the Alpheus higher up, and
close to Tegea in the eastern plain.</note> is guarded at its south
end by Megalopolis. That which is more east, which
is higher in level, and separated from the former by
the bleak bar of Mænalus, is the plain of Mantinea
and Tegea, now represented by the important town
of Tripolitza. These two parallel plains give some
plan and system to the confusion of mountains which
cover the ordinary maps of Arcadia.
</p>

<p>
The passage from Elis into Arcadia is nowhere
marked by any natural boundary. You ride up the
valley of the Alpheus, crossing constantly the
<pb n='358'/><anchor id='Pg358'/>streams, great and small, which come flowing into
it from the spurs of Erymanthus, from northern
Arcadia, and the adjoining highlands of Elis. The
stream called Erymanthus, which is the old boundary,
though called a <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">λάβρος ποταμὸς</foreign> by Polybius,
does not strike the traveller here as it does higher
up in its course, and the only other confluent water
worth mentioning is the Ladon, which meets the
Alpheus at some hours’ ride above Olympia, but
which counted of old as a river of Arcadia. This
Ladon seems to have specially struck Pausanias with
its beauty, as he returns to it several times; and
later observers, such as M. Beulé, have corroborated
him, saying that on the banks of this river you may
indeed find the features of the poetical Arcadia—grassy
slopes and great shady trees, without the defiles
and precipices so common in the inner country.
The Ladon and its valley in fact, though in Arcadia,
partake of the character of the neighboring Elis: it
is the outer boundary of the real Alps. The Alpheus,
on the contrary, which is a broad, peaceful
stream when it passes into tamer country, comes
through the wildest part of central Arcadia; and if
you follow its course upward, will lead you first past
the ancient site of Heræa, a few miles above the
Ladon, and then through rugged and savage mountains,
till you at last ascend to the valley of Megalopolis,
round which it winds in a great curve. We
did not follow this route, nor did we ascend the
<pb n='359'/><anchor id='Pg359'/>valley of the Ladon, in spite of its reputed beauties.
For we were bound for Andritzena, a ride of eleven
hours from Olympia, which lay to the S. E., and
within easy distance of the temple of Bassæ. We
therefore forded the Alpheus, just above the confluence
of the Ladon, where the two rivers form a
great delta of sand, and the stream is broad and
comparatively shallow. The banks were clothed
with brushwood, and above it with a green forest,
along the grassy margin of which scarlet anemones
were scattered like our primroses among the stems
of the trees, and varied with their brightness the
mosses and hoary lichen. From this point onward
we began to cross narrow defiles, and climb up steeps
which seemed impossible to any horse or mule. We
entered secluded mountain valleys, where the inhabitants
appeared to live apart from all the world, and
looked with wonder upon the sudden stranger. We
rested beside tumbling rivers, rushing from great
wooded mountain sides, which stood up beside us
like walls of waving green. The snow had disappeared
from these wild valleys but a few weeks,
and yet even the later trees were already clothed
with that yellow and russet brown which is not only
the faded remnant, but also the forerunner, of the
summer green. And down by the river’s side the
gray fig trees were putting forth great tufts at the
end of every branch, while the pear trees were
showering their snowy blossoms upon the stream.
<pb n='360'/><anchor id='Pg360'/>But in one respect, all this lonely solitude showed a
marked contrast to the wilds of northern Greece.
Every inch of available ground was cultivated; all
the steep hill sides were terraced in ridges with infinite
labor; the ravages of the winter’s torrent were
being actively repaired. There was indeed in some
sense a solitude. No idlers or wanderers were to be
seen on the way. But the careful cultivation of all
the country showed that there was not only population,
but a thrifty and careful population. All the
villages seemed encumbered with the remains of recent
building; for almost all the houses were new,
or erected within very few years. The whole of
this alpine district seemed happy and prosperous.
This, say the Greeks, is the result of its remoteness
from the Turkish frontier, its almost insular position—in
fact, of its being under undisturbed Hellenic
rule. No bandit has been heard of in Arcadia since
the year 1847. Life and property are, I should
think, more secure than in any part of England.
Morals are remarkably pure. If all Greece were
occupied in this way by a contented and industrious
peasantry, undisturbed by ambition from within or
violence from without, the kingdom must soon become
rich and prosperous. It was not uncommon to
find in these valleys two or three secluded homesteads,
miles from any village. This is the surest
sign both of outward security and of inward thrift,
when people cut themselves off from society for the
<pb n='361'/><anchor id='Pg361'/>sake of ample room and good return for their industry.
Late in the evening we entered the steep
streets of the irregular but considerable town of
Andritzena.
</p>

<p>
We experienced in this place some of the rudeness
of Greek travel. As the party was too large
to be accommodated in a private house, we sought
the shelter of a <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ξενοδοχεῖον</foreign>, as it is still called—an
inn with no chairs, no beds, one tiny table, and
about two spoons and forks. We were in fact
lodged within four bare walls, with a balcony outside
the room, and slept upon rugs laid on the floor.
The people were very civil and honest—in this
a great contrast to the inn at Tripolitza, of which
I shall speak in due time—and were, moreover, considerably
inconvenienced by our arrival during the
Passion Week of the Greek Church, when there is
hardly anything eaten. There was no meat, of
course, in the town. But this was not all. No
form of milk, cheese, or curds, is allowed during
this fast. The people live on black bread, olives,
and hard-boiled eggs. They are wholly given up
to their processions and services; they are ready
to think of nothing else. Thus we came not only
to a place scantily supplied, but at the scantiest
moment of the year. This is a fact of great importance
to travellers in Greece, and one not mentioned,
I think, in the guide-books. Without making careful
provision beforehand by telegraph, no one should
<pb n='362'/><anchor id='Pg362'/>venture into the highlands of Greece during this very
Holy Week, and it should be remembered that it
does not coincide with the Passion or Holy Week of
the Latin Church. It was just ten days later on
this occasion; so that, after having suffered some
hardships from this unforeseen cause in remote parts
of Italy, we travelled into the same difficulty in
Greece. But I must say that a Greek fast is a
very different thing from the mild and human fasting
of the Roman Catholic Church. We should have
been well-nigh starved had I not appealed, as was
my wont, to the physician, <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ὁ κύριος ἴατρος</foreign>, of the
town, a very amiable and cultivated man, and really
educated in the most philosophical views of modern
medicine. He was well acquainted, for example,
with the clinical practice of the Dublin school, as
exemplified in the works of Graves and Stokes. It
seems to me, from a comparison of many instances,
that in this matter of medicine, as indeed generally,
the Greeks show remarkable intelligence and enterprise
as compared with the nations around them.
They study in the great centres of European thought.
They know the more important languages in which
this science can be pursued. A traveller taken ill
in the remote valleys of Arcadia would receive far
safer and better treatment than would be his lot in
most parts of Italy.
</p>

<p>
The gentleman to whom I appealed in this case
did all he could to save us from starvation. He
<pb n='363'/><anchor id='Pg363'/>procured for us excellent fresh curds. He obtained
us the promise of meat from the mountains. He
came to visit us, and tell us what we required to know
of the neighborhood. Thus we were able to spend
the earlier portion of the night in comparative comfort.
But, as might have been expected, when the
hour for sleep had arrived our real difficulties began.
I was protected by a bottle of spirits of camphor,
with which my rugs and person were sufficiently
scented to make me an object of aversion to my
assailants. But the rest of the party were not so
fortunate. It was, in fact, rather an agreeable
diversion, when we were roused, or rather, perhaps,
distracted, shortly after midnight, by piercing yells
from a number of children, who seemed to be slowly
approaching our street.
</p>

<p>
On looking out a very curious scene presented
itself. All the little children were coming in slow
procession, each with a candle in its hand, and shouting
<hi rend='italic'>Kyrie Eleison</hi> at the top of its voice. After the
children came the women and the older men (I fancy
many of the younger men were absent), also with
candles, and in the midst a sort of small bier, with
an image of the dead Christ laid out upon it, decked
with tinsel and flowers, and surrounded with lights.
Along with it came priests in their robes, singing in
gruff bass some sort of Litany. The whole procession
adjourned to the church of the town, where the
women went to a separate gallery, the men gathered
<pb n='364'/><anchor id='Pg364'/>in the body of the building, and a guard of soldiers
with fixed bayonets stood around the bier of their
Christ. Though the congregation seemed very
devout, and many of them in tears at the sufferings
of their Saviour, they nevertheless all turned round
to look at the strangers who chanced to witness their
devotions. To those who come from without, and
from a different cult, and see the service of a strange
nation in a strange tongue, the mesquin externals
are the first striking point, and we wonder how deep
devotion and true piety can exist along with what
is apparently mean and even grotesque. And yet
it is in these poor and shabby services, it is with
this neglect or insouciance of detail, that purer
faith and better morals are found than in the gorgeous
pageants and stately ceremonies of metropolitan
cathedrals.
</p>

<p>
We rose in the morning eager to start on our
three hours’ ride to Bassæ, where Ictinus had built
his famous but inaccessible temple to Apollo the
Helper. The temple is very usually called the
temple of Phigalía, and its friezes are called Phigalian,
I think, in the British Museum. This is so
far true that it was built for and managed by the
people of Phigalía. But the town was a considerable
distance off,—according to Pausanias forty
stadia, or about five miles,—and he tells us they
built the temple at a place called Bassæ (the glades),
near the summit of Mount Kotilion. Accordingly,
<pb n='365'/><anchor id='Pg365'/>it ought to be consistently called the temple at or
of Bassæ.
</p>

<p>
The morning, as is not unusual in these Alps, was
lowering and gloomy, and as we and our patient
mules climbed up a steep ascent out of the town,
the rain began to fall in great threatening drops.
But we would not be daunted. The way led among
gaunt and naked mountain sides, and often up the
bed of winter torrents. The lateness of the spring,
for the snow was now hardly gone, added to the
gloom; the summer shrubs and the summer grass
were not yet green, and the country retained most
of its wintry bleakness. Now and then there met
us in the solitude a shepherd coming from the mountains,
covered in his white woollen cowl, and with
a lamb of the same soft dull color upon his shoulders.
It was the day of preparation for the Easter feast,
and the lamb was being brought by this picturesque
shepherd, not to the fold, but to the slaughter. Yet
there was a strange and fascinating suggestion in the
serious face surrounded by its symphony of white,
in the wilderness around, in the helpless patience of
the animal, all framed in a background of gray mist,
and dripping with abundant rain. As we wound our
way through the mountains we came to glens of
richer color and friendlier aspect. The sound of
merry boys and baying dogs reached up to us from
below as we skirted far up along the steep sides,
still seeking a higher and higher level. Here the
<pb n='366'/><anchor id='Pg366'/>primrose and violet took the place of the scarlet and
the purple anemone, and cheered us with the sight
of northern flowers, and with the fairest produce of
a northern spring.
</p>

<p>
At last we attained a weird country, in which the
ground was bare, save where some sheltered and
sunny spot showed bunches of very tall violets,
hanging over in tufts, rare purple anemones, and
here and there a great full iris; yet these patches
were so exceptional as to make a strong contrast
with the brown soil. But the main features were
single oak-trees with pollarded tops and gnarled
branches, which stood about all over these lofty
slopes, and gave them a melancholy and dilapidated
aspect. They showed no mark of spring, no shoot
or budding leaf, but the russet brown rags of last
year’s clothing hung here and there upon the
branches. These wintry signs, the gloomy mist,
and the insisting rain gave us the feeling of chill
October. And yet the weird oaks, with their
branches tortured as it were by storm and frost—these
crippled limbs, which looked as if the pains of
age and disease had laid hold of the sad tenants of
this alpine desert—were colored with their own
peculiar loveliness. All the stems were clothed
with delicate silver-gray lichen, save where great
patches of velvety, pale green moss spread a warm
mantle about them. This beautiful contrast of gray
and yellow-green may be seen upon many of our
<pb n='367'/><anchor id='Pg367'/>own oak-trees in the winter, and makes these the
most richly colored of all the leafless stems in our
frosty landscape. But here there were added among
the branches huge tufts of mistletoe, brighter and
yellower than the moss, yet of the same grassy hue,
though of different texture. And there were trees so
clothed with this foreign splendor that they looked like
some quaint species of great evergreen. It seemed
as if the summer’s foliage must have really impaired
the character and the beauty of this curious forest.
</p>

<p>
At last we crossed a long flat summit, and began
to descend, when we presently came upon the temple
from the north, facing us on a lower part of the lofty
ridge. As we approached, the mist began to clear
away, and the sun shone out upon the scene, while
the clouds rolled back toward the east, and gradually
disclosed to us the splendid prospect which the sanctuary
commands. All the southern Peloponnesus
lay before us. We could see the western sea, and
the gulf of Koron to the south; but the long ridge
of Taygetus and the mountains of Malea hid from
us the eastern seas. The rich slopes of Messene,
and the rugged highlands of northern Laconia and
of Arcadia, filled up the nearer view. There still
remained here and there a cloud which made a blot
in the picture, and marred the completeness of the
landscape.
</p>

<p>
Nothing can be stranger than the remains of a
beautiful temple in this alpine solitude. Greek life
<pb n='368'/><anchor id='Pg368'/>is a sort of protest for cities and plains and human
culture, against picturesque Alps and romantic
scenery. Yet here we have a building of the
purest age and type set up far from the cities and
haunts of men, and in the midst of such a scene as
might be chosen by the most romantic and sentimental
modern. It was dedicated to Apollo the
Helper, for his deliverance of the country from the
same plague which devastated Athens at the opening
of the Peloponnesian War,<note place="foot">This is what Pausanias says, though modern scholars seem
very doubtful about it.</note> and was built by the
greatest architect of the day, Ictinus, the builder of
the Parthenon.
</p>

<p>
It was reputed in Pausanias’s day the most beautiful
temple in Peloponnesus, next to that of Athene
Alea at Tegea. Even its roof was of marble tiles,
and the cutting of the limestone soffits of the ceiling
is still so sharp and clear, that specimens have been
brought to Athens, as the most perfect of the kind.
The friezes, discovered years ago (1812), and quite
close to the surface, by Mr. Cockerell and his friends,
were carried away, and are now one of the greatest
ornaments of the British Museum. Any one who
desires to know every detail of the building, and see
its general effect when restored, must consult Cockerell’s
elaborate work on this and the temple of
Ægina. It affords many problems to the architect.
Each of the pillars within the cella was engaged or
<pb n='369'/><anchor id='Pg369'/>attached to the wall, by joinings at right angles with
it, the first pair only reaching forward toward the
spectator as he entered. The temple faces north,
contrary to the usual habit of the Greeks. In the
very centre was found a Corinthian capital—another
anomaly in a Doric temple, and at the epoch of
Periclean art. In Mr. Cockerell’s restoration of the
interior, this capital is fitted to a solitary pillar in
the centre of the cella, and close to the statue of the
god, which apparently faced sideways, and looked
toward the rising sun. It is a more popular theory
that it was set up much later, with some votive
tripod upon it, and that it does not belong to the
original structure. The frieze in this temple was
not along the outside wall of the cella, but inside,
and over the pillars, as the narrow side aisle (if
I may so call it) between the pillars and cella
wall was broken by the joining of the former,
five at each side, with the latter. I cannot but
fancy that this transference of the friezes to the
inner side of the wall was caused by the feeling
that the Parthenon friezes, upon which such great
labor and such exquisite taste had been lavished,
were after all very badly seen, being <q>skied</q> into
a place not worthy of them. Any one who will look
up at the remaining band on the west front of the
Parthenon from the foot of the pillars beneath will,
I think, agree with me. At <anchor id="corr369"/><corr sic="Basse">Bassæ</corr> there are many
peculiarities in the Ionic capitals, and in the
orna<pb n='370'/><anchor id='Pg370'/>mentation of this second monument of Ictinus’s
genius, which have occupied the architects, but on
which I will not here insist.<note place="foot">Several details, such as the unusual length in proportion to
the breadth, the engaged pillars inside the cella, and the forms of
the capitals, have now been explained as deliberate archaicisms on
the part of Ictinus, who here copied far older forms. The curious
Ionic, and even the Corinthian, capitals, may point back to old
Asianic, or Assyrian, models, and the proportions of the cella with
its engaged pillars have their prototype or parallel in the curious
old <hi rend='italic'>Heræon</hi> (cf. <ref target="Pg304">p. 304</ref>) found at Olympia. This seems to me a
very happy solution of the difficulties, and shows us Ictinus in a
new light. Another specimen of his art, with unexpected features,
may be the newly unearthed Hall of the Mysteries at Eleusis,
already described, if indeed this be his work, and not a late copy
of it.</note> The general effect is
one of smallness, as compared with the Parthenon;
of lightness and grace, as compared with the temple
at Olympia, the Doric pillars being here somewhat
more slender than those of the Parthenon, though
the other proportions are not unlike. The style of
the frieze has been commented upon in all our histories
of Greek art. The effect produced is, moreover,
that of lateness, as compared with the Athenian
sculptures; there is more exaggerated action,
flying drapery and contorted limbs, and altogether a
conscious striving to give a strong effect. But the execution,
which was probably entrusted to native artists
under Attic direction, is inferior to good Attic work,
and in some cases positively faulty. Unfortunately,
this part of the temple is in London, not at Bassæ.

The ruin, as we saw it, was very striking and unlike
any other we had visited in Greece. It is built
of the limestone which crops up all over the mountain
plateau on which it stands; and, as the sun
shone upon it after recent rain, was of a delicate
bluish-gray color, so like the surface of the ground
in tone that it almost seemed to have grown out of
the rock, as its natural product. The pillars are
indeed by no means monoliths, but set together of
short drums, of which the inner row are but the
rounded ends of long blocks which reach back to
the cella wall. But as the grain of the stone runs
across the pillars they have become curiously
wrinkled with age, so that the artificial joinings are
lost among the wavy transverse lines, which make
us imagine the pillars sunk with years and fatigue,
and weary of standing in this wild and gloomy
solitude. There is a great oak-tree, such as I have
already described, close beside the temple, and the
coloring of its stem forms a curious contrast to the
no less beautiful shading of the time-worn pillars.
Their ground being a pale bluish-gray, the lichens
which invade the stone have varied the fluted surface
with silver, with bright orange, and still more
with a delicate rose madder. Even under a mid-day
sun these rich colors were very wonderful, but what
must they be at sunset?
</p>

<p>
There is something touching in the unconscious
efforts of Nature to fill up the breaks and heal the
<pb n='372'/><anchor id='Pg372'/>rents which time and desolation have made in human
work. If a gap occurs in the serried ranks of city
buildings by sudden accident or natural decay, the
site is forthwith concealed with hideous boarding;
upon which, presently, staring portraits of latest
clown or merriest mountebank mock as it were the
ruin within, and advertise their idle mirth—an uglier
fringe around the ugly stains of fire or the heaps
of formless masonry. How different is the hand of
Nature! Whether in the northern abbey or in the
southern fane, no sooner are the monuments of
human patience and human pride abandoned and
forgotten, than Nature takes them into her gentle
care, covers them with ivy, with lichen, and with
moss, plants her shrubs about them, and sows them
with countless flowers. And thus, when a later age
repents the ingratitude of its forerunners, and turns
with new piety to atone for generations of forgetfulness,
Nature’s mantle has concealed from harm much
that had else been destroyed, and covered the remainder
with such beauty that we can hardly conceive
these triumphs of human art more lovely in
their old perfection than in their modern solitude
and decay.

The way from Andritzena to Megalopolis leads
down from the rugged frontiers of Arcadia and
Messene, till we reach the fine rolling plain which
has Karytena at its northern, and Megalopolis near
<pb n='373'/><anchor id='Pg373'/>its southern, extremity. Our guides were in high
spirits, and kept singing in turn a quaint love song,
which, after the usual timeless flourishes and shakes
at the opening, ended in the following phrase,
which their constant repetition stamped upon my
memory:
</p>
<pgIf output='txt'><then>
  <p rend="ill">[Illustration: Music]</p>
</then><else>
  <p><figure url="images/music429.png" rend="w80"><figDesc>music</figDesc></figure></p>
</else></pgIf>
<p>
The way was at first steep and difficult—we were
still in the land of the violet and primrose. But after
an hour’s ride we came into a forest which already
showed summer signs; and here we found again the
anemone, the purple and white cistus, among shrubs
of mastich and arbutus. Here, too, we found the
cyclamen, which is such a favorite in the green-houses
and gardens of England. We passed a few
miles to the south of Karytena, with its wonderful,
and apparently impregnable Frankish fortress perched
like an eagle’s nest on the top of a huge cliff, from
which there must be a splendid outlook not only down
the valley of Megalopolis, but into the northern
passes from Achaia, and the mountains of Elis. I
can conceive no military post more important to the
Arcadian plain, and yet it seems to have attained
no celebrity in ancient history. From this fortress
to the southern end of the plain, where the passes
lead to Sparta and to northern Messene, there lies
extended a very rich vein of country about
twenty-<pb n='374'/><anchor id='Pg374'/>five miles long, and ten or twelve broad, with some
undulation, but practically a plain, well irrigated
with rapid rivers, and waving with deep grass and
green wheat. There are flourishing villages scattered
along the slopes of the mountains, and all the
district seems thoroughly tilled, except the region
south of the town, where forests of olives give a
wilder tone to the landscape.
</p>

<p>
I confess I had not understood the history of the
celebrated foundation of Megalopolis, until I came
to study the features of this plain. Here, as elsewhere,
personal acquaintance with the geography
of the country is the necessary condition of a living
knowledge of its history. As is well known, immediately
after the battle of Leuctra the Arcadians
proceeded to build this metropolis, as a safeguard
or makeweight against the neighboring power of
Sparta. Pausanias, who is very full and instructive
on the founding of the city, tells us that the founders
came from the chief towns of Arcadia—Tegea,
Mantinea, Kleitor, and Mænalus. But these cities
had no intention of merging themselves in the new
capital. In fact, Mantinea and Tegea were in themselves
fully as important a check on Sparta in their
own valley, and were absolutely necessary to hold
the passes northward to Argos, which lay in that
direction. But the nation insisted upon all the
village populations in and around the western plain
(which hitherto had possessed no leading city)
amal<pb n='375'/><anchor id='Pg375'/>gamating into Megalopolis, and deserting their ancient
homes. Many obeyed; Pausanias enumerates
about forty of them. Those who refused were exiled,
or even massacred by the enraged majority.
Thus there arose suddenly the <hi rend='italic'>great city</hi>, the latest
foundation of a city in Classical Greece. But in
his account it seems to me that Pausanias has omitted
to take sufficient note of the leading spirit of
all the movement—the Theban Epaminondas. No
doubt, the traveller’s Arcadian informants were too
thoroughly blinded by national vanity to give him
the real account, if indeed, they knew it themselves.
They represented it as the spontaneous movement
of the nation, and even stated it to have been done
in imitation of Argos, which in older times, when in
almost daily danger of Spartan war, had abolished
all the townships through Argolis, and thus increased
its power and consolidated its population.
</p>

<p>
But the advice and support of Epaminondas,
which made him the real founder, point to another
model. The traveller who comes, after he has seen
northern Greece, into the plain of Megalopolis, is at
once struck with its extraordinary likeness to that
of Thebes. There is the same circuit of mountains,
the same undulation in the plain, the same abundance
of water, the same attractive sites on the slopes
for the settlements of men. It was not then Argos,
with its far remote and not very successful centralization,
but Thebes, which was the real model; and
<pb n='376'/><anchor id='Pg376'/>the idea was brought out into actuality not by Arcadian
but by Theban statesmanship. Any Theban
who had visited the plain could not but have this
policy suggested to him by the memory of his own
home. But here Epaminondas seems to have concealed
his influence, and carried out his policy
through Arcadian agents, merely sending 1000
Thebans, under Pammenes, to secure his allies
against hostile disturbances, whereas he proceeded
to the foundation of Messene in person, and with
great circumstance, as the dreams and oracles, the
discussions about the site, and the pomp at the ceremony
amply show, even in the cold narrative of
Pausanias. But Megalopolis, though a great and
brilliant experiment, was not a lasting success. It
was laid out on too large a scale, and in after years
became rather a great wilderness than a great city.<note place="foot">The same must have been the case with Messene, which was
laid out likewise by Epaminondas on an absurdly large scale, as
the remains of the great walls still show. They seem intended to
enclose a whole parish, and not a city. But of these I shall speak
again, <ref target="Pg452">p. 452</ref>.</note>
It was full of splendid buildings—the theatre, even
now, is one of the most gigantic in Greece. But
the violences of its foundation, which tore from
their homes and household gods many citizens of
ancient and hallowed sites, were never forgotten.
It was long a leading city in politics, but never
became a favorite residence, and fell early into
<pb n='377'/><anchor id='Pg377'/>decay. <q>Although,</q> says Pausanias (8. 33), <q>the
<hi rend='italic'>great city</hi> was founded with all zeal by the Arcadians,
and with the brightest expectations on the
part of the Greeks, I am not astonished that it has
lost all its elegance and ancient splendor, and most
of it is now ruined, for I know that Providence is
pleased to work perpetual change, and that all
things alike, both strong and weak, whether coming
into life or passing into nothingness, are changed
by a Fortune which controls them with an iron necessity.
Thus Mycenæ, Nineveh, and the Bœotian
Thebes are for the most part completely deserted and
destroyed, but the name of Thebes has descended to
the mere acropolis and very few inhabitants. Others,
formerly of extraordinary wealth, the Egyptian
Thebes and the Minyan Orchomenus and Delos,
the common mart of the Greeks, are some of them
inferior in wealth to that of a private man of not
the richest class; while Delos, being deprived of the
charge of the Oracle by the Athenians who settled
there, is, as regards Delians, depopulated. At Babylon
the temple of Belus remains, but of this Babylon,
once the greatest city under the sun, there is
nothing left but the wall, as there is of Tiryns in
Argolis. These the Deity has reduced to naught.
But the city of Alexander in Egypt, and of Seleucus
on the Orontes, built the other day, have risen
to such greatness and prosperity, because Fortune
favors them.... Thus the affairs of men have
<pb n='378'/><anchor id='Pg378'/>their seasons, and are by no means permanent.</q>
These words of Pausanias have but increased in
force with the lapse of centuries. The whole ancient
capital of the Arcadians has well-nigh disappeared.
The theatre, cut out from the deep earthen
river bank, and faced along the wings with massive
masonry, is still visible, though overgrown with
shrubs; and the English school of Athens is now
prosecuting its exploration (1892).
</p>

<p>
The ancient town lay on both sides of the river
Helisson, which is a broad and silvery stream, but
not difficult to ford, as we saw it in spring, and Pausanias
mentions important public buildings on both
banks. Now there seems nothing but a mound,
called the tomb of Philopœmen, on the north side,
with a few scanty foundations. On the south side
the stylobate of at least one temple is still almost on
the level of the soil, and myriads of fragments of
baked clay tell us that this material was largely
used in the walls of a city where a rich alluvial
soil afforded a very scanty supply of stone—a difficulty
rare in Greece. The modern town lies a
mile to the south of the river, and quite clear of the
old site, so that excavations can be made without
considerable cost, and with good hope of results.
But the absence of any really archaic monument has,
till recently, damped the ardor of the archæologists.
</p>

<p>
The aspect of the present Megalopolis is very
pleasing. Its streets are wide and clean, though
<pb n='379'/><anchor id='Pg379'/>for the most part grown over with grass, and a
single dark green cypress takes, as it were, the
place of a spire among the flat roofs. We found
the town in holiday, and the inhabitants—at least
the men—in splendid attire. For the women of the
Morea have, alas! abandoned their national costume,
and appear in tawdry and ill-made dresses. Even
the men who have travelled adopt the style of third-rate
Frenchmen or Germans, and go about in tall
hats, with a dirty gray plaid wrapped about their
shoulders. To see these shoddy-looking persons
among a crowd of splendid young men in Palikar
dress, with the erect carriage and kingly mien
which that very tight costume produces, is like
seeing a miserable street cur among a pack of fox-hounds.
And yet we were informed that, for political
reasons, and in order to draw the Greeks from
their isolation into European habits, the national
dress is now forbidden in the schools!
</p>

<p>
We were welcomed with excellent hospitality in
the town, and received by a fine old gentleman,
whose sons, two splendid youths in full costume, attended
us in person. Being people of moderate
means, they allowed us, with a truer friendliness than
that of more ostentatious hosts, to pay for the most
of the materials we required, which they got for us
of the best quality, at the lowest price, and cooked
and prepared them for us in the house. We inquired
of the father what prospects were open to his
hand<pb n='380'/><anchor id='Pg380'/>some sons, who seemed born to be soldiers—the
ornaments of a royal pageant in peace, the stay of
panic in battle. He complained that there was no
scope for their energies. Of course, tilling of the
soil could never satisfy them. One of them was secretary
to the <hi rend='italic'>Demarchus</hi>, on some miserable salary.
He had gone as far as Alexandria to seek his fortune,
but had come home again, with the tastes and
without the wealth of a rich townsman. So they
are fretting away their life in idleness. I fear that
such cases are but too common in the country towns
of Greece.
</p>

<p>
The people brought us to see many pieces of
funeral slabs, of marble pillars, and of short and late
inscriptions built into house walls. They also sold
us good coins of Philip of Macedon at a moderate
price. The systematic digging about the old site
undertaken by the English school will probably bring
to light many important remains.<note place="foot">The results hitherto attained are still uncertain, owing to an
active controversy between Dr. Dörpfeld and the English explorers,
which has not yet (1892) been settled. I forbear entering
upon it here.</note> There is a carriage
road from Megalopolis to Argos, but the portion
inside the town was then only just finished, so we
preferred riding as far as Tripoli. Travellers now
landing at Argos will find it quite practicable to
drive from the coast to this central plain of Arcadia,
and then begin their riding. There is now, alas! a
<pb n='381'/><anchor id='Pg381'/>railway from Argos to Tripoli in progress. By this
means even ladies can easily cross the Morea. Two
days’ driving to Megalopolis, two days’ riding to Olympia,
and an easy day’s drive and train to Katakalo,
would be the absolute time required for the transit.
But the difficulty is still to find a comfortable night’s
lodging between the first and second day’s ride, both
of them long and fatiguing journeys. Andritzena is
too near Megalopolis, and not to be recommended
without introductions. But there is probably some
village on another route which would afford a half-way
house. From Tripoli and from Megalopolis,
which command their respective plains, excursions
could be made to Mantinea, to Sparta, and best of
all to Kalamata, where a coasting steamer calls frequently.

<p>
As we rode up the slopes of Mount Mænalus,
which separates the plain of Tegea from that of
Megalopolis, we often turned to admire the splendid
view beneath, and count the numerous villages now
as of old under the headship of the <hi rend='italic'>great town</hi>. The
most striking feature was doubtless the snowy ridge
of Taygetus, which reaches southward, and showed
us the course of the Eurotas on its eastern side,
along which a twelve hours’ ride brings the traveller
to Sparta. The country into which we passed was
wild and barren in the extreme, and, like most so-called
mountains in Greece, consisted of a series of
parallel and of intersecting ridges, with short valleys
<pb n='382'/><anchor id='Pg382'/>or high plateaus between them. This journey, perhaps
the bleakest in all Peloponnesus, until it approaches
the plain of Tegea, is through Mount
Mænalus, the ancestral seat of the worship of Pan,
and therefore more than any other tract of Arcadia
endowed with pastoral richness and beauty by the
poets. There may be more fertile tracts farther
north in these mountains. There may in ancient
times have been forest or verdure where all is now
bare. But in the present day there is no bleaker
and more barren tract than these slopes and summits
of Mænalus, which are wholly different from the
richly wooded and well carpeted mountains through
which we had passed on the way from Elis. Even
the asphodel, which covers all the barer and stonier
tracts with its fields of bloom, was here scarce and
poor. Dull tortoises, and quick-glancing hoopoes,
with their beautiful head-dresses, were the only tenants
of this solitude. There was here and there a
spring of delicious water where we stopped. At one
of them the best of our ponies, an unusually spirited
animal, escaped up the mountain, with one of our
royal-looking young friends, who had accompanied
us in full costume, for want of other amusement, in
hot pursuit of him. We thought the chase utterly
hopeless, as the pony knew his way perfectly, and
would not let any one approach him on the bare hillsides;
so we consolidated our baggage, and left them
to their fate. But about two hours afterward the
<pb n='383'/><anchor id='Pg383'/>young Greek came galloping after us on the pony,
which he had caught—he had accomplished the
apparently impossible feat.
</p>

<p>
At last, after a very hot and stony ride, with less
color and less beauty than we had ever yet found in
Greece, we descended into the great valley of Tripoli,
formerly held by Tegea at the south, and Mantinea
at the north. The modern town lies between
the ancient sites, but nearer to Tegea, which is not
an hour’s ride distant. The old Tripolis, of which
the villages were absorbed by Megalopolis, is placed
by the geographers in quite another part of Arcadia,
near Gortyn, and due north of the western plain.
The vicissitudes of the modern town are well known;
its importance under the Turks, its terrible destruction
by the Egyptians in the War of Liberation;<note place="foot">It is usually forgotten in recent accounts that this sacking of
the town was no more than a retribution for the hideous massacre
of the whole Turkish population, including women and children,
in cold blood, by the insurgent Greeks. The details may be had
in General Gordon’s <hi rend='italic'>Memoirs</hi> or in Finlay’s <hi rend='italic'>History</hi>.</note>
even now, though not a house is more than fifty
years old, it is one of the largest and most important
towns in the Morea.
</p>

<p>
The whole place was in holiday, it being the
Greek Easter Day, and hundreds of men in full
costume crowded the large square in the middle of
the town. There is a considerable manufacture of
what are commonly called Turkey carpets, and of
<pb n='384'/><anchor id='Pg384'/>silk; but the carpets have of late years lost all the
beauty and harmony of color for which they were
so justly admired, and are now copied from the
worst Bavarian work—tawdry and vulgar in the extreme.
They are sold by weight, and are not dear,
but they were so exceedingly ugly that we could not
buy them. This decadence of taste is strange when
compared with the woollen work of Arachova. If
the colors of the Arachovite rugs were transferred
to the carpets of Tripoli, nothing could be more
effective, or more likely to attract English buyers.
I could not learn that any passing travellers save
some Germans, are now ever tempted to carry them
home.
</p>

<p>
It is my disagreeable duty to state that while the
inn at Tripoli was no better than other country inns
in Arcadia, and full of noise and disturbance, the
innkeeper, a gentleman in magnificent costume, with
a crimson vest and gaiters, covered with rich embroidery,
also turned out a disgraceful villain, in fact
quite up to the mark of the innkeepers of whom
Plato in his day complained. We had no comforts,
we had bad food, we had the locks of our baggage
strained, not indeed by thieves, but by curious
neighbors, who wished to see the contents; we had
dinner, a night’s lodging, and breakfast, for which
the host charged us, a party of four and a servant,
118 francs. And be it remembered that the wine of
the country, which we drank, is cheaper than ale in
<pb n='385'/><anchor id='Pg385'/>England. We appealed at once to the magistrate, a
very polite and reasonable man, who cut it down to
84 francs, still an exorbitant sum, and one which our
friend quietly pocketed without further remonstrance.
It is therefore advisable either to go with introductions,
which we had (but our party was too large for
private hospitality), or to stipulate beforehand concerning
prices. I mention such conduct as exceptional—we
met it only here, at Sparta, and at
Nauplia; but I fear Tripoli is not an honest district.
A coat and rug which were dropped accidentally
from a mule were picked up by the next wayfarer,
who carried them off, though we had passed him but
a few hundred yards, and there could be no doubt
as to the owners. Our guides knew his village,
and our property was telegraphed for, but never
reappeared.
</p>

<p>
The site of Tegea, where there is now a considerable
village, is more interesting, being quite
close to the passes which lead to Sparta, and surrounded
by a panorama of rocky mountains. The
morning was cloudy, and lights and shades were
coursing alternately over the view. There were no
trees, but the surface of the rocks took splendid
changing hues—gray, pink, and deep purple—while
the rich soil beneath alternated between brilliant
green and ruddy brown. As the plain of Megalopolis
reminded me of that of Thebes, so this plain
of Tegea, though infinitely richer in soil, yet had
<pb n='386'/><anchor id='Pg386'/>many features singularly like that of Attica, especially
its bareness, and the splendid colors of its barren
mountains. But the climate is very different at
this great height above the sea; the nights, and even
the mornings and evenings, were still chilly, and the
crops are still green when the harvest has begun in
Attica. There are a good many remains, especially
of the necropolis of Tegea, to be found scattered
through the modern village, chiefly in the walls of
new houses. One of these reliefs contained a very
good representation of a feast—two men and two
women, the latter sitting, and alternately with the
men; the whole work seemed delicate, and of a good
epoch. These and other remains, especially an excellent
relief of a lion, are now gathered into the
little museum of the village of Piali, which occupies
part of the ancient site. The circuit of the ancient
walls and the site and plan of the great temple of
Athena Alea have also recently been determined.
The temple, rebuilt by Scopas about 395 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>, had
Corinthian as well as Ionic capitals, though externally
Doric in character. Some remarkable remains
of the pediment, especially a boar’s head, are now in
the Museum at Athens.
</p>

<p>
The way to Argos is a good carriage road through
the passes of Mount Parthenion, and is not unlike
the bleak ride through Mænalus, though there is a
great deal more tillage, and in some places the hillsides
are terraced with cultivation. It was in this
<pb n='387'/><anchor id='Pg387'/>mountain that the god Pan met the celebrated runner
Phidippides, who was carrying his despatch about
the Persian invasion from Athens to Sparta, and told
him he would come and help the Athenians at Marathon.
This Mount Parthenion, bleak and bare like
Mount Mænalus, and yet like it peculiarly sacred to
Pan, <q>affords tortoises most suitable for the making
of lyres, which the men who inhabit the mountains
are afraid to catch, nor do they allow strangers to
catch them, for they think them sacred to Pan.</q>
We saw these tortoises, both in Mænalus and Parthenion,
yet to us suggestive not of harmony but of
discord. Two of them were engaged in mortal combat
by the road side. They were rushing at each
other, and battering the edges of their shells together,
apparently in the attempt to overturn each other.
After a long and even conflict, one of them fled,
pursued by the other at full speed, indeed far
quicker than could be imagined. We watched the
battle till we were tired, and left the pursuer and
the pursued in the excitement of their deadly struggle.
The traveller who goes by the new railroad
over this ground will never see sights like this.
</p>

<p>
These were the principal adventures of our tour
across Arcadia. The following night we rested in
real luxury at the house of our old guest-friend,
Dr. Papalexopoulos, whose open mansion had received
us two years before, on our first visit to
Argos.

<p>
The Gulf of Corinth is a very beautiful and narrow
fiord, with chains of mountains on either side, through
the gaps of which you can see far into the Morea
on one side, and into northern Greece on the other.
But the bays or harbors on either coast are few, and
so there was no city able to wrest the commerce of
these waters from old Corinth, which held the keys
by land of the whole Peloponnesus, and commanded
the passage from sea to sea. It is, indeed, wonderful
how Corinth did not acquire and maintain the
first position in Greece. It may, perhaps, have
done so in the days of Periander, and we hear at
various times of inventions and discoveries in
Corinth, which show that, commercially and artistically,
it was among the leading cities of Greece.
But, whenever the relations of the various powers
become clear, as in the Persian or Peloponnesian
Wars, we find Corinth always at the head of the
second-rate states, and never among the first. This
is possibly to be accounted for by the predominance
<pb n='389'/><anchor id='Pg389'/>of trade interests, which are the source of such material
prosperity that men are completely engrossed
with it, and will not devote time and labor to politics,
or stake their fortunes for the defence of principle.
Thus it seems as if the Corinthians had been the
shopkeepers of Greece.
</p>

<p>
But as soon as the greater powers of Greece decayed
and fell away, we find Corinth immediately
taking the highest position in wealth, and even in
importance. The capture of Corinth, in 146 <hi rend="small">B. C.</hi>,
marks the Roman conquest of all Greece, and the
art-treasures carried to Rome seem to have been as
great and various as those which even Athens could
have produced. Its commercial position was at once
assumed by Delos. No sooner had Julius Cæsar
restored and rebuilt the ruined city than it sprang
at once again into importance,<note place="foot">Strabo mentions that the new settlers, coming upon old tombs
in the digging for new foundations, found there quantities of graceful
pottery, which was sold to Romans, and became the fashion
there. Hence it was diligently sought and sold under the title
<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">νεκροκορίνθια</foreign>. We may be sure that every ancient tomb was rifled
in this way.</note> while Delos decayed;
and among the societies addressed in the Epistles of
St. Paul, none seems to have lived in greater wealth
or luxury. It was, in fact, well-nigh impossible that
Corinth should die. Nature had marked out her site
as one of the great thoroughfares of the old world;
and it was not till after centuries of blighting misrule
by the wretched Turks that she sank into the
<pb n='390'/><anchor id='Pg390'/>hopeless decay from which not even another Julius
Cæsar could rescue her.<note place="foot">On the foundation of the new Greek kingdom, it was seriously
debated whether Corinth should not be the capital; but the constant
prevalence of fever in the district, together with sentimental
reasons, determined the selection of Athens in preference.</note>
</p>

<p>
These were our reflections as we passed up the
gulf on a splendid summer evening, the mountains
of Arcadia showing on their snowy tops a deep rose
color in the setting sun. And passing by Ægion
and Sikyon, we came to anchor at the harbor of
Lechæum. There was a public conveyance which
took the traveller across the isthmus to Kenchreæ,
where a steamboat was in readiness to bring him
to Athens. But with the usual absurdity of such
services, no time was allowed for visiting Corinth
and its Acropolis.<note place="foot">Even the new railway has not altered this. The journey up
and down the bay in a coasting steamer is still well worth undertaking.</note> We, however, stayed for the
night in the boat, and started in the morning for our
ride into the Peloponnesus. This arrangement was
then necessary, as the port of Lechæum did not
afford the traveller even the luxury of a decent
meal. The Greek steamers are, besides, of considerable
interest to any observant person. They
seem always full of passengers with their dogs, and
as the various classes mix indiscriminately on deck,
all sorts of manners, costume, and culture can be
easily compared.
</p>

<pb n='391'/><anchor id='Pg391'/>

<p>
The fondness of the Greeks for driving a bargain
is often to be noticed. Thus, a Greek gentleman on
this boat, perceiving that we were strangers in pursuit
of art and antiquities, produced two very fine gold
coins of Philip and Alexander, which he offered for
£5. That of Philip was particularly beautiful—a
very perfect Greek head in profile, crowned with
laurel, and on the reverse a chariot and four, with
the legend, <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">Φίλιππος</foreign>. Not being a very expert judge
of coins, and supposing that he had asked more than
the value, I offered him £2: 10s. for this one, which
was considerably the larger; but he would not take
any abatement. He evidently was not anxious to
sell them, but merely took his chance of getting a
good price, and investing it again at better interest.
Seeing that the coin seemed but little heavier than
our sovereign, and is not uncommon in collections,
I fancy the price he asked was excessive. The
Athenian shops, which are notorious for their prices
to strangers, had similar coins, for which about £4
was asked. On this, and a thousand other points,
the traveller should be instructed by some competent
person before he sets out. Genuine antiquities seem
to me so common in Greece, that imitations are
hardly worth manufacturing. Even with a much
greater market, the country can supply for generations
an endless store of real remains of ancient
Greece. But, nevertheless, the prices of these
things are already very high. The ordinary tourist
<pb n='392'/><anchor id='Pg392'/>does not infest these shores, so that the only seekers
after them are enthusiasts, who will not hesitate to
give even fancy prices for what they like.
</p>

<p>
The form of the country, as you ascend from
Lechæum to Corinth, is very marked and peculiar.
At some distance from the flat shore the road leads
up through a steep pass of little height, which is
cut through a long ridge of rock, almost like a wall,
and over which lies a higher plateau of land. The
same feature is again repeated a mile inland, as the
traveller approaches the site of ancient Corinth.
These plateaus, though not lofty, are well marked,
and perfectly distinct, the passes from one up to the
next being quite sufficient to form a strong place of
defence against an attacking force. How far these
rocky parapets reach I did not examine. Behind the
highest plateau rises the great cliff on which the
citadel was built. But even from the site of the
old city it is easy to obtain a commanding view of
the isthmus, of the two seas, and of the Achæan
coast up to Sikyon.
</p>

<p>
The traveller who expects to find any sufficient
traces of the city of Periander and of Timoleon,
and, I may say, of St. Paul, will be grievously disappointed.
In the middle of the wretched straggling
modern village there stand up seven enormous
rough stone pillars of the Doric Order, evidently
of the oldest and heaviest type; and these
are the only visible relic of the ancient city, looking
<pb n='393'/><anchor id='Pg393'/>altogether out of place, and almost as if they had
come there by mistake. These pillars, though insufficient
to admit of our reconstructing the temple,
are in themselves profoundly interesting. Their
shaft up to the capital is of one block, about twenty-one
feet high and six feet in diameter. It is to be
observed that over these gigantic monoliths the
architrave, in which other Greek temples show the
largest blocks, is not in one piece, but two, and
made of beams laid together longitudinally.<note place="foot">M. Viollet-le-duc, in his <hi rend='italic'>Entretiens sur l’Architecture</hi>, vol. i. p.
45, explains the reason of this. Apart from the greater facility of
raising smaller blocks, most limestones are subject to flaws, which
are disclosed only by strain. Hence it was much safer to support
the entablature on two separate beams, one of which might sustain,
at least temporarily, the building, in case the other should
crack.</note> The
length of the shafts (up to the neck of the capital)
measures about four times their diameter, on the
photograph which I possess; I do not suppose that
any other Doric pillar known to us is so stout and
short. The material is said almost universally to be
limestone, but if my eyes served me aright, it was
a very porous and now rough sandstone, not the
least like the bluish limestone in which the lions of
the gate of Mycenæ are carved. The pillars are
said to have been covered with stucco, and were
of course painted. Perhaps even the figures of the
pediment were modelled in clay, as we are told was
the case in the oldest Corinthian temples, when first
<pb n='394'/><anchor id='Pg394'/>the fashion came in of thus ornamenting an otherwise
flat and unsightly surface. The great temple of
Pæstum—which is, probably, the next oldest, and
certainly the finest extant specimen of the early
Doric style—has no figures in the pediment, and
seems never to have had them, unless, indeed, they
were painted in fresco on the stucco, with which it
was probably covered. Those who have seen the
temple at Pæstum are, perhaps, the only visitors
who will be able to frame to themselves an image
of the very similar structure at Corinth, which
Turks and earthquakes have reduced to seven columns.
There must have been in it the same simplicity,
the same almost Egyptian massiveness, and
yet the same unity of plan and purpose which excludes
all idea of clumsiness or disproportion.

<p>
The longer one studies the Greek orders of architecture,
the more the conviction grows that the
Doric is of all the noblest and the most natural.
When lightened and perfected by the Athenians of
Pericles’s time, it becomes simply unapproachable;
but even in older and ruder forms it seems to me
vastly superior to either of the more florid orders.
All the massive temples of Roman times were built
in the very ornate Corinthian, which may almost be
called the Græco-Roman, style; but, notwithstanding
their majesty and beauty, they are not to be
compared with the severer and more religious tone
of the Doric remains. I may add that the titles by
<pb n='395'/><anchor id='Pg395'/>which the orders are distinguished seem ill-chosen
and without meaning, except, perhaps, that the Ionic
was most commonly used, and probably invented, in
Asia Minor. The earliest specimens of the Corinthian
Order are at Epidaurus, Olympia, and Phigalia;<note place="foot">Cf. <ref target="Pg370">pp. 370</ref>
    and <ref target="Pg433">433</ref>.</note>
the most perfect of the Doric is at Athens,
while Ionic temples are found everywhere. But it
is idle now to attempt to change such definite and
well-sanctioned names.

<p>
Straight over the site of the town is the great
rock known as the Acro-Corinthus. A winding
path leads up on the south-west side to the Turkish
drawbridge and gate, which are now deserted and
open; nor is there a single guard or soldier to watch
a spot once the coveted prize of contending empires.
In the days of the Achæan League it was called one
of the fetters of Greece, and indeed it requires no
military experience to see the extraordinary importance
of the place. Strabo speaks of the Peloponnesus
as the Acropolis of Greece—Corinth may
fairly be called the Acropolis of the Peloponnesus.
It runs out boldly from the surging mountain-chains
of the peninsula, like an outpost or sentry, guarding
all approach from the north. In days when news
was transmitted by fire signals, we can imagine how
all the southern country must have depended on the
watch upon the rock of Corinth. It is separated by
a wide plain of land, ending in the isthmus, from
<pb n='396'/><anchor id='Pg396'/>the Geranean Mountains, which come from the north
and belong to a different system.
</p>

<p>
Next to the view from the heights of Parnassus,
I suppose the view from this citadel is held the
finest in Greece.<note place="foot">Strabo, who had apparently travelled but little through
Greece, speaks with admiration of this view, which he had evidently
seen. The fortress of Karytena is some twenty or thirty
feet higher in situation and far more picturesque from below, but
is too much surrounded by other high mountains to admit of a
prospect like that from the Acro-Corinthus.</note> I speak here of the large and
diverse views to be obtained from mountain heights.
To me, personally, such a view as that from the
promontory of Sunium, or, above all, from the harbor
of Nauplia, exceeds in beauty and interest any
bird’s-eye prospect. Any one who looks at the map
of Greece will see how the Acro-Corinthus commands
coasts, islands, and bays. The day was too
hazy when we stood there to let us measure the real
limits of the view, and I cannot say how far the eye
may reach in a suitable atmosphere. But a host of
islands, the southern coasts of Attica and Bœotia,
the Acropolis of Athens, Salamis and Ægina, Helicon
and Parnassus, and endless Ætolian peaks were
visible in one direction; while, as we turned round,
all the waving reaches of Arcadia and Argolis, down
to the approaches toward Mantinea and Karytena,
lay stretched out before us. The plain of Argos,
and the sea at that side, are hidden by the
moun<pb n='397'/><anchor id='Pg397'/>tains.<note place="foot">See also <hi rend='italic'>Guide Joanne</hi>, ii. p. 197.</note> But without going into detail, this much
may be said, that if a man wants to realize the features
of these coasts, which he has long studied on
maps, half an hour’s walk about the top of this rock
will give him a geographical insight which months
of reading could not attain.
</p>

<p>
The surface is very large, at least half a mile each
way, and is covered inside the bounding wall with
the remains of a considerable Turkish town, now in
ruins and totally deserted, but evidently of no small
importance in the days of the War of Liberation.
The building of this town was a great misfortune to
antiquarians, for every available remnant of old
Greek work was used as material for the modern
houses. At all parts of the walls may be seen white
marble fragments of pillars and architraves, and I
have no doubt that a careful dilapidation of the modern
abandoned houses would amply repay the outlay.
There are several pits for saving rain-water, and
some shallow underground passages of which we
could not make out the purpose. The pits or tanks
must have been merely intended to save trouble, for
about the middle of the plateau, which sinks considerably
toward the south, we were brought to a
passage into the ground, which led by a rapid descent
to the famous well of Pirene, the water of
which was so perfectly clear that we walked into it
on going down the steps, as there was actually no
<pb n='398'/><anchor id='Pg398'/>water-line visible. It was twelve or fourteen feet
deep, and perhaps twenty-five feet long, so far as we
could make it out in the twilight underground. The
structure of marble over the fountain is the only
piece of old Greek work we could find on the rock.
It consists of three supports, like pillars, made of
several blocks, and over them a sort of architrave.
Then there is a gap in the building, and from the
large number of fragments of marble lying at the
bottom of the well we concluded that the frieze and
cornice had fallen out. The pediment, or rather its
upper outline, is still in its place, clear of the architrave,
and built into the rock so as to remain without
its supporting cornice.
</p>

<p>
There are numerous inscriptions as you descend,
which I did not copy, because I was informed they
had already been published, though I have not since
been able to find them; but they are, of course, to
be found in some of the Greek archæological newspapers.
They appeared to me at the time to be
either hopelessly illegible, or suspiciously clear.
This great well, springing up near the top of a
barren rock, is very curious, especially as we could
see no outlet.<note place="foot">This is just what Strabo says (viii. 6, § 21):
    <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἔκρυσιν μὲν οὐκ ἔχουσαν μεστὴν δ’ ἀεὶ διαυγοῦς καὶ ποτίμου ὕδατος</foreign>, and Corinth was
one of the few Greek places he visited.</note> The water was deep under the surface,
and there was no sign of welling up or of outflow
anywhere; but to make sure of this would have
<pb n='399'/><anchor id='Pg399'/>required a long and careful ride round the whole
ridge. Our guide-book spoke of rushing streams
and waterfalls tumbling down the rock, which we
searched for in vain, and which may have been
caused by a winter rainfall without any connection
with the fountain.<note place="foot">So also learned men speak about the amphitheatre. Herzberg
(ii. 253) says: <q>Seine Ruine steht noch heute.</q> Cf. also Friedländer,
ii. 383, but I could not find it.</note>
</p>

<p>
The Isthmus, which is really some three or four
miles north of Corinth, was of old famous for the Isthmian
games, as well as for the noted <hi rend='italic'>diolkos</hi>, or road
for dragging ships across. The games were founded
about 586 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>, when a strong suspicion had arisen
throughout Greece concerning the fairness of the
Elean awards at Olympia, and for a long time Eleans
were excluded. In later days the games became
very famous, the Argives or Cleonæans laying claim
to celebrate them. It was at these games that Philip
V. heard of the great defeat of the Romans by Hannibal,
and resolved to enter into that colossal quarrel
which brought the Romans into Macedonia. The
site of the stadium, and of the temple of Isthmian
Poseidon, and of the fortified sanctuary, were excavated
and mapped out by M. Monceaux in 1883. A
plan and details are to be found in the French <hi rend='italic'>Guide
Joanne</hi>.<note place="foot">Part ii. p. 198, <hi rend='italic'>sq.</hi> (1891).</note> Close by I saw in 1889 the interrupted
work of the canal which was at last to connect the
<pb n='400'/><anchor id='Pg400'/>eastern and western gulfs, and which when well-nigh
completed found its funds dissipated by the terrible
crash of the Credit Mobilier in Paris, and now awaits
another enterprise. The idea is old and often discussed,
like that of the Isthmus of Suez. The
Emperor Nero actually began the work, and the
engineers of to-day resumed the cutting at the very
spot where his workmen left off.
</p>

<p>
But if this very expensive work might have been
of great service when sailing-ships feared to round
the notorious Cape of Malea, and when there was
great trade from the Adriatic to the ports of Thessaly
and Macedonia, surely all these advantages are
now superseded. Steamers coming from the Straits
of Messina would pay nothing to take the route of the
Isthmus in preference to rounding the Morea, and
the main line of traffic is no longer to the Northern
Levant, but to Alexandria. Even goods despatched
from Trieste or Venice may now be landed at Patras,
and sent on by rail to Athens; so that the canal will
now only serve the smallest fraction of the Levantine
trade; and even then, if the charges be at all adequate
to the labor, will be avoided by circumnavigation.
Amid the promotion of many useful schemes
of traffic, this undertaking seems to me to stand out
by its want of common sense. Indeed, had it been
really important at any date, we may be sure
that the Hellenistic Sovrans or Roman capitalists
would have carried it out. But in classical days
<pb n='401'/><anchor id='Pg401'/>their smaller ships seem to have been dragged
across upon movable rollers by slaves without much
difficulty.
</p>

<p>
But we had already delayed too long upon this
citadel, where we would have willingly spent a day
or two at greater leisure. Our guide urged us to
start on our long ride, which was not to terminate
till we reached the town of Argos, some thirty miles
over the mountains.<note place="foot">The reader who performs this journey by train may consider
whether what here follows is not an older and better way.</note>
</p>

<p>
The country into which we passed was very different
from any we had yet seen, and still it was
intensely Greek. All the hills and valleys showed
a very white, chalky soil, which actually glittered
like snow where it was not covered with verdure or
trees. Road, as usual, there was none; but all these
hills and ravines, chequered with snowy white, were
clothed with shining arbutus trees, and shrubs resembling
dwarf holly. The purple and the white
cistus, which is so readily mistaken for a wild rose,<note place="foot"><foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">πολλὸς δὲ καὶ ὡς ῥόδα κίσθος ἐπανθεῖ</foreign>.—<hi rend='smallcaps'>Theocr.</hi> v. 131.</note>
were already out of blow, and showed but a rare
blossom. Here and there was a plain or valley with
great fields of thyme about the arbutus, and there
were herds of goats wandering through the shrubs,
and innumerable bees gathering honey from the
thyme. The scene was precisely such as Theocritus
describes in the uplands of Sicily; but in all
<pb n='402'/><anchor id='Pg402'/>our rides through that delightful island<note place="foot">There is a tract of sea-coast on the east side of Italy, about
halfway between Ancona and Monte Gargano, which has this
Theocritean character to perfection. Even the railway passenger
can appreciate the curious contrast it affords to the splendid
orchards and gardens about Bari, which are still farther south.</note> we had
never found the thyme and arbutus, the goats and
bees, in such truly Theocritean perfection. We
listened in vain for the shepherd’s pipe, and sought
in vain for some Thyrsis beguiling his time with the
oaten reed. It was almost noontide—noon, the hour
of awe and mystery to the olden shepherd, when
Pan slept his mid-day sleep,<note place="foot"><lg>
    <l><foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">οὐ θέμις, ὦ ποιμήν, τὸ μεσημβρινόν, οὐ θέμις ἆμμιν</foreign></l>

was abroad, prowling for adventure through the
silent woods; so that, in pagan days, we might have
been afraid of the companionship of melody. But
now the silence was not from dread of Pan’s displeasure,
but that the sun’s fiercer heat had warned
the shepherds to depart to the snowy heights of
Cyllene, where they dwell all the summer in alpine
huts, and feed their flocks on the upland pastures,
which are covered with snow till late in the spring.
</p>

<p>
They had left behind them a single comrade, with
his wife and little children, to protect the weak and
the lame till their return. We found this family
settled in their winter quarters, which consisted of a
<pb n='403'/><anchor id='Pg403'/>square enclosure of thorns
    <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">θρίγκος ἀχέρδου</foreign>, built
up with stones, round a very old spreading olive-tree.
At the foot of the tree were pots and pans,
and other household goods, with some skins and
rude rugs lying on the ground. There was no
attempt at a roof or hut of any kind, though, of
course, it might be set up in a moment, as we had
seen in the defiles of Parnassus, with skins hung
over three sticks—two uprights, and the third joining
their tops, so as to form a ridge.
</p>

<p>
To make the scene Homeric,<note place="foot"><lg>

two large and very savage dogs rushed out
upon us at our approach, but the shepherd hurried
out after them, and drove them off by pelting them
vigorously with stones. <q>Surely,</q> he said, turning
to us breathlessly from his exertions, <q>you had met,
O strangers! with some mischief, if I had not been
here.</q> The dogs disappeared, in deep anger, into
the thicket, and, though we stayed at the place for
some time, never reappeared to threaten or to pursue
us on our departure. We talked as best we could
to the gentle shepherdess, one of whose children had
a fearfully scalded hand, for which we suggested
remedies to her occult and wonderful, though at
<pb n='404'/><anchor id='Pg404'/>home so trite as to be despised by the wise. She
gave us in return great bowls of heated milk, which
was being made into cheese, and into various kinds
of curds, which are the very best produce of the
country. They would take no money for their
hospitality, but did not object to our giving the
children coins to play with—to them, I am sure, a
great curiosity.
</p>

<p>
Most of our journey was not, however, through
pastures and plains, but up and down steep ravines,
where riding was so difficult and dangerous that we
were often content to dismount and lead our horses.
Every hour or two brought us to a fountain springing
from a rock, and over it generally a great
spreading fig-tree, while the water was framed in
on both sides with a perfect turf of maiden-hair
fern. The only considerable valley which we saw
was that of Cleonæ, which we passed some miles on
our left, and about which there was a great deal of
golden corn, and many shady plane-trees. Indeed,
the corn was so plentiful that we saw asses grazing
in it quite contentedly, without any interference from
thrifty farmers. We had seen a very similar sight
in Sicily, where the enormous deep-brown Sicilian
oxen, with their forward-pointing horns, were
stretching their huge forms in fields of half-ripe
wheat, which covered all the plain without fence
or division. There, too, it seemed as if this was
the cheapest grazing, and as if it were unprofitable
<pb n='405'/><anchor id='Pg405'/>labor to drive the cattle to some untilled pasture.
As for the treading-out of corn, I saw it done at
Argos by a string of seven horses abreast, with two
young foals at the outside, galloping round a small
circular threshing-floor in the open field, upon which
the ripe sheaves had been laid in radiating order. I
have no doubt that a special observer of farming
operations would find many interesting survivals
both in Greece and the Two Sicilies.
</p>

<p>
Toward evening, after many hours of travel, we
turned aside on our way down the plain of Argos,
to see the famous ruins of Mycenæ. But we will
now pass them by, as the discoveries of Dr. Schliemann,
and a second visit to the ruins after his excavations,
have opened up so many questions, that
a separate chapter must be devoted to them.
</p>

<p>
The fortress of Tiryns, which I have already
mentioned, and which we visited next day, may
fitly be commented on before approaching the
younger, or at least more artistically finished,
Mycenæ. It stands several miles nearer to the
sea, in the centre of the great plain of Argos, and
upon the only hillock which there affords any natural
scope for fortification. Instead of the square, or at
least hewn, well-fitted blocks of Mycenæ, we have
here the older style of rude masses piled together as
best they would fit, the interstices being filled up
with smaller fragments, and, as we now know, faced
with mortar. This is essentially Cyclopean
build<pb n='406'/><anchor id='Pg406'/>ing.<note place="foot">Pausanias speaks of Mycenæ and Tiryns as of like structure,
which is not true. He often refers with wonder to these walls, and
reflects upon the care with which Greek historians had described
foreign curiosities like the Pyramids, while equally wonderful
things in Greece were left unnoticed. Thus, he says that no pair
of mules could stir from its place the smallest of the blocks in the
walls of Tiryns. Cf. ii. 25, 8; and ix. 36, 5.</note> There is a smaller castle of rectangular shape,
on the southern and highest part of the oblong hillock,
the whole of which is surrounded by a lower
wall, which takes in both this and the northern
longer part of the ridge. It looked, in fact, like a
hill-fort, with a large enclosure for cattle around it.
</p>

<p>
Just below the north-east angle of the inner fort,
and where the lower circuit is about to leave it,
there is an entrance, with a massive projection of
huge stones, looking like a square tower, on its
right side, so as to defend it from attack. The
most remarkable feature in the walls are the covered
galleries, constructed within them at the south-east
angle. The whole thickness of the wall is often
over twenty feet, and in the centre a rude arched
way is made—or rather, I believe, two parallel
ways; but the inner gallery has fallen in, and is
almost untraceable—and this merely by piling
together the great stones so as to leave an opening,
which narrows at the top in the form of a
Gothic arch. Within the passage there are five
niches in the outer side, made of rude arches, in
the same way as the main passage. The length of
<pb n='407'/><anchor id='Pg407'/>the gallery I measured, and found it twenty-five
yards, at the end of which it is regularly walled up,
so that it evidently did not run all the way round.
The niches are now no longer open, but seem to
have been once windows, or at least to have had
some look-out points into the hill country.

</else></pgIf>
<p>
It is remarkable that, although the walls are made
of perfectly rude stones, the builders have managed
to use so many smooth surfaces looking outward,
that the face of the wall seems quite clean and well-built.<note place="foot">The same effect is observable in Staigue Fort, in the county
of Kerry, and has led some people to imagine that its stones were
rudely fashioned. Cf. the splendid photographs of this Irish
Tiryns in Lord Dunraven’s <hi rend='italic'>Notes on Irish Architecture</hi>.</note>
At the south-east corner of the higher and
inner level we found a large block of red granite,
quite different from the rough gray stone of the
building, with its surface square and smooth, and
all the four sides neatly bevelled, like the portal
stones at the treasury of Atreus. I found two other
similar blocks close by, which were likewise cut
smooth on the surface, and afterward, in company
with Dr. Schliemann, a large Doric capital. The
intention of these stones we could not guess, but
they show that some ornament, and some more finished
work, must have once existed in or near the
inner building. Though both the main entrances
have massive towers of stone raised on their right,
there is a small postern at the opposite or west side,
<pb n='408'/><anchor id='Pg408'/>not more than four feet wide, which has no defences
whatever, and is a mere hole in the wall.
</p>

<p>
The whole ruin was covered in summer with thistles,
such as English people can hardly imagine.
The needles at the points of the leaves are fully an
inch long, extremely fine and strong, and sharper
than any two-edged sword. No clothes except a
leather dress can resist them. They pierce everywhere
with the most stinging pain, and make antiquarian
research in this famous spot a veritable
martyrdom, which can only be supported by a very
burning love for knowledge, or the sure hope of
future fame. The rough masses of stone are so
loose that one’s footing is insecure, and when the
traveller loses his balance, and falls among the thistles,
he will wish that he had gone to Jericho instead,
or even fallen among thieves on the way.
</p>

<p>
Such was the aspect of Tiryns when I visited it
in the years 1875 and in 1877. In 1884 I went
there again with Dr. Schliemann, who was uncovering
the palace on the height. The results of his
discoveries are so important that I shall review
them in another chapter.
</p>

<p>
We rode down from Mycenæ to Argos late in the
evening, along the broad and limpid stream of the
river Inachus, which made us wonder at the old epic
epithet, <hi rend='italic'>very thirsty</hi>, given to this celebrated plain.<note place="foot"><foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">πολυδίψιον</foreign>.
    A fragment of Hesiod (quoted by Eustathius in
<hi rend='italic'>Il.</hi>, p. 350) notes this epithet, in order to account for its being no
longer true,
<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">Ἄργος ἄνυδρον ἔον Δαναὸς ποίησεν ἔνυδρον</foreign>. Strabo
(viii. p. 256) explains it by confining the epithet to the town of
Argos, which Homer certainly did not, and by admitting that
the country was well watered. Pausanias (ii. 15, 5) says that all
the rivers ran dry, except in rainy weather, which is seldom true
now.</note>
<pb n='409'/><anchor id='Pg409'/>Though the night was getting dark, we could see
and smell great fields of wild rose-red oleander,
blooming along the river banks, very like the rhododendrons
of our demesnes. And, though not a
bird was to be heard, the tettix, so dear to the old
Greeks, and so often the theme of their poets, was
making the land echo with its myriad chirping.
Aristophanes speaks of it as crying out with mad
love of the noonday sun.<note place="foot"><lg>
    <l><foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἀλλ’ ἀνθηρῶν λειμώνων, φύλλων τ’ ἐν κόλποις ναίω,</foreign></l>

    <l><foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">θάλπεσι μεσημβρινοῖς ἡλιομανὴς βοᾷ.</foreign> (<hi rend='italic'>Aves</hi>, 1092–8.)</l></lg>
The little-known lines in the <hi rend='italic'>Shield of Hercules</hi> are also worth
quoting (393, <hi rend='italic'>sqq.</hi>):—
<lg><l><foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἦμος δὲ χλοερῷ κυανόπτερος, ἠχέτα τέττιξ,</foreign></l>

    <l><foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἴδει ἐν αἰνοτάτῳ, ὁπότε χρόα Σείριος ἄζει.</foreign></l></lg></note> We found it no less eager
and busy in late twilight, and far into the night.
I can quite understand how the old Greek, who
hated silence, and hated solitude still more, loved
this little creature, which kept him company even
in the time of sleep, and gave him all the feelings
of cheerfulness and homeliness which we northerns,
<pb n='410'/><anchor id='Pg410'/>in our wretched climate, must seek from the cricket
at the fireside.
</p>

<p>
At ten o’clock we rode into the curious dark
streets of Argos, and, after some difficulty, were
shown to the residence of M. Papalexopoulos, who
volunteered to be our host—a medical man of education
and ability, who, in spite of a very recent
family bereavement, opened his house to the stranger,
and entertained us with what may well be called in
that country real splendor. I may notice that he
alone, of all the country residents whom we met,
gave us wine not drenched with resin—a very
choice and remarkable red wine, for which the plain
of Argos is justly celebrated. In this comfortable
house we slept, I may say, in solitary grandeur, and
awoke in high spirits, without loss or damage, to
visit the wonders of this old centre of legend and
of history.
</p>

<p>
It is very easy to see why all the Greek myths
have placed the earliest empires, the earliest arts,
and the earliest conquests, in the plains of Argolis.
They speak, too, of this particular plain having the
benefit of foreign settlers and of foreign skill. If
we imagine, as we must do, the older knowledge of
the East coming up by way of Cyprus and Crete
into Greek waters, there can be no doubt that the
first exploring mariners, reaching the barren island
of Cerigo, and the rocky shore of Laconia, would
feel their way up this rugged and inhospitable coast,
<pb n='411'/><anchor id='Pg411'/>till they suddenly came in sight of the deep bay of
Argolis, stretching far into the land, with a broad
plain and alluvial soil beyond its deepest recess.
Here, first, they would find a suitable landing-place,
and a country fit for tillage; and here, accordingly,
we should expect to find, as we actually do, the
oldest relics of habitation, beyond the huts of
wandering shepherds or of savages. So the legend
tells us that Cyclopes came from Lycia to King
Prœtus of Argos, or rather of the Argive plain, and
built him the giant fort of Tiryns.<note place="foot">These Cyclopes, cunning builders, and even workers in metal,
are to be carefully distinguished from the rude and savage Cyclopes
represented in Homer’s <hi rend='italic'>Odyssey</hi> as infesting Thrinacria, in the
western seas.</note>
</p>

<p>
This was evidently the oldest great settlement.
Then, by some change of fortune, it seems that
Mycenæ grew in importance, not impossibly because
of the unhealthy site of Tiryns, where the surroundings
are now low and marshy, and were, probably,
even more so in those days. But the epoch of
Mycenæ’s greatness also passed away in historical
times; and the third city in this plain came forward
as its ruler—Argos, built under the huge Larissa, or
hill-fort, which springs out from the surrounding
mountains, and stands like an outpost over the city.<note place="foot">In the days of the composition of the <hi rend='italic'>Iliad</hi> we see the power
and greatness of Mycenæ distinctly expressed by the power of
Agamemnon, who appears to rule over all the district and many
islands. Yet the great hero, Diomedes, is made the sovereign of
Argos and Tiryns in his immediate neighborhood. This difficulty
has made some critics suppose that all the acts of Diomedes were
foisted in by some of the Argive reciters of the <hi rend='italic'>Iliad</hi>. Without
adopting this theory, which seems to me extravagant, I would suggest
that, in the poet’s day, Argos was rapidly growing into first-rate
importance, while all the older legends attested the greatness
of Mycenæ. Thus the poet, who was obliged to put together the
materials given him by divers older and shorter poems, was under
the difficulty of harmonizing the fresher legends about Argos with
the older about Mycenæ.</note>
<pb n='412'/><anchor id='Pg412'/>Even now it is still an important town, and maintains,
in the midst of its smiling and well-cultivated
plain, a certain air of brightness and prosperity
which is seldom to be seen elsewhere through the
country.
</p>

<p>
We went first to visit the old theatre, certainly
the most beautifully situated,<note place="foot">I prefer this view even to that from the theatre of Taormina
in Sicily, which is so justly celebrated, and which many people
think the finest in Europe.</note> and one of the largest
I had ever seen. It is far finer than even that of
Syracuse, and whoever has seen this latter will know
what such a statement implies. If the Greek theatre
at Syracuse has a view of the great harbor and the
coast around, this view can only have been made
interesting by crowded shipping and flitting sails, for
the whole incline of the country is very gradual,
and not even the fort of Ortygia presents any bold
or striking outline.
</p>

<p>
The Argive theatre was built to hold an enormous
audience. We counted sixty-six tiers of seats, in
<pb n='413'/><anchor id='Pg413'/>four divisions—thus differing from the description
of Colonel Leake, which we had before us at the
time. As he observes, there may be more seats
still covered with rubbish at the bottom—indeed
this, like all the rest of Argos, ought to yield a rich
harvest to the antiquarian, being still almost virgin
soil, and never yet ransacked with any care. From
the higher seats of the theatre of Argos, which rise
much steeper than those of Syracuse, there is a most
enchanting prospect to the right, over a splendid rich
plain, covered, when we first saw it, with the brilliant
emerald-green of young vines and tobacco plants,
varied with the darker hue of plane-trees and
cypresses. After the wilderness through which we
had passed this prospect was intensely delightful.
Straight before us, and to the left, was the deep blue
bay of Argolis, with the white fortifications of Nauplia
crowning its picturesque Acropolis. All around us,
in every other direction, was a perfect amphitheatre
of lofty mountains. This bay is, for its size, the
most beautiful I ever saw, and the opinion which we
then formed was strengthened by a sunset view of it
from the other side—from Nauplia—which was, if
possible, even finer, and combined all the elements
which are conceivable in a perfect landscape. Near
the theatre there is a remnant of Cyclopean building,
apparently the angle of a wall, made of huge uncut
blocks, like those at Tiryns. There are said to be
some similar substructures on the Larissa, which is,
<pb n='414'/><anchor id='Pg414'/>however, itself a mediæval ruin, and therefore, to
us, of slight interest.
</p>

<p>
All the children about brought us coins, of every
possible date and description, but were themselves
more interesting than their coins. For here, in
southern Greece, in a very hot climate, in a level
plain, every second child is fair, with blue eyes, and
looks like a transplanted northern, and not like the
offspring of a southern race. After the deep brown
Italian children, which strike the traveller by their
southernness all the way from Venice to Reggio,
nothing is more curious than these fairer children,
under a sunnier and hotter sky; and it reminds the
student at once how, even in Homer, yellow hair
and a fair complexion is noted as belonging to the
King of Sparta. This type seems to me common
wherever there has not arisen a mixed population,
such as that of Athens or Syra, and where the
inhabitants appear to live as they have done for
centuries. Fallmerayer’s cleverness and undoubted
learning persuaded many people, and led many more
to suspect, that the old Greek race was completely
gone, and that the present people were a mixture of
Turks, Albanians, and Slavs. To this many answers
suggest themselves,—to me, above all things, the
strange and accurate resemblances in character between
ancient and modern Greeks,—resemblances
which permeate all their life and habits.
</p>

<p>
But this is a kind of evidence not easily stated in
<pb n='415'/><anchor id='Pg415'/>a brief form, and consists after all of a large number
of minute details. The real refutation of Fallmerayer’s
theory consists in exposing the alleged evidence
upon which it rests. He puts forth with great
confidence citations from MS. authorities at Athens,
which have not been verified; nay, he is even proved
to have been the dupe of some clever forgeries. A
careful examination of the scanty allusions to the
state of Greece during the time of its supposed
<hi rend='italic'>Slavisation</hi>, and the evidences obtained from the
lives of the Greek saints who belong to this epoch,
have proved to demonstration that the country was
never wholly occupied by foreigners, or deserted by
its old population. The researches of Ross, Ellissen,
and lastly of Hopf,<note place="foot">Cf. his exhaustive article on the Mediæval History of Greece,
in Ersch and Gruber’s <hi rend='italic'>Encyclopædia</hi>, vol. lxxxv., and more especially
his refutation of Fallmerayer’s theory, pp. 100–19.</note> have really set the matter
at rest; but, unfortunately, English students will for
some time to come be misled by the evident leaning
of Finlay toward the Slav hypothesis. As has been
fairly remarked by later critics, Finlay did not test
the documents cited by Fallmerayer; and until this
was done, the case seemed conclusive enough for
the total devastation of Greece during four hundred
years, and its occupation by a new population. But
all this is now relegated to the sphere of fable.
There is, of course, a large admixture of Slavs
and Albanians in the country; the constant
inva<pb n='416'/><anchor id='Pg416'/>sions and partial conquests for several centuries
could not but introduce it. Still, Greece has remained
Greek in the main, and the foreigners have
not been able to hold their own against the stronger
nationality of the true Hellenes.
</p>

<p>
Another weighty argument seems to me to be
from language.<note place="foot">A great authority, whose opinion I deeply respect—Prof.
Sayce—goes so far as to say that language is by itself no proof of
race, but only of social contact. I will not venture to deny that
there are instances where this is so, and where invading strangers
have adopted the language of the vanquished, though quite foreign
to them. But surely this is the exception, and not the rule, and
there is a <hi rend='italic'>primâ facie</hi> probability in favor of a well-preserved language
indicating a well-preserved race.</note> There is really very little difference
between the language of Plato and that of the
present Greeks. There is, of course, development
and decay, there are changes of idiom and corruptions
of form, there are a good many Slav names,
but the language is essentially the same. The
present Greek will read the old classics with the
same trouble with which our peasants could read
Chaucer. It is, in fact, most remarkable, assuming
that they are the same people, how their language
has not changed more. Had the invaders
during the Middle Ages really become the main
body of the population, how is it that they abandoned
their own tongue, and adopted that of the
Greeks? Surely there must be at least a fusion of
different tongues, if the population were
consider<pb n='417'/><anchor id='Pg417'/>ably leavened. There are still Albanian districts
in Greece. They are to be found even in Attica,
and close to Athens. But these populations are
still tolerably distinct from the Greeks; their language
is quite different, and unintelligible to Greeks
who have not learned it.
</p>

<p>
Again, the Greek language is not one which
spread itself easily among foreigners, nor did it
give rise to a number of daughter languages, like
the Latin. In many Hellenic colonies, barbarians
learned to speak Greek with the Greeks, and to
adopt their language at the time; but in all these
cases, when the Greek influence vanished the
Greek language decayed, and finally made way for
the old tongue which it had temporarily displaced.
Thus the evidence of history seems to suggest that
no foreigners were ever really able to make that
subtle tongue their own; and even now we can feel
the force of what Aristotle says—that however well
a stranger might speak, you could recognize him at
once by his use of the particles.
</p>

<p>
These considerations seem to me conclusive that,
whatever admixtures may have taken place, the
main body of the people are what their language
declares them to be, essentially Greeks. Any careful
observer will not fail to see through the wilder
parts of the Morea types and forms equal to those
which inspired the old artists. There are still among
the shepherd boys splendid lads who would adorn a
<pb n='418'/><anchor id='Pg418'/>Greek gymnasium, or excite the praise of all Greece
at the Olympian games. There are still maidens
fit to carry the sacred basket of Athene. Above
all, there are still many old men fit to be chosen for
their stalwart beauty to act as <hi rend='italic'>thallophori</hi> in the
Panathenaic procession.
</p>

<p>
These thoughts often struck us as we went through
the narrow and crowded streets of Argos, in search
of the peculiar produce of the place—raw silks, rich-colored
carpets and rugs, and ornamental shoes in
dull red <q>morocco</q> leather.
</p>

<p>
We were taken to see the little museum of the
town—then a very small one, with a single inscription,
and eight or ten pieces of sculpture. But the
inscription, which is published, is exceedingly clear
and legible, and the fragments of sculpture are all
both peculiar and excellent. There is a female head
of great beauty, about half life-size, and from the
best, or certainly a very good, period of Greek art,
which has the curious peculiarity of one eye being
larger than the other. It is not merely the eyeball,
but the whole setting of the eye, which is slightly
enlarged, nor does it injure the general effect. The
gentlemen who showed this head to me, and who
were all very enthusiastic about it, had indeed not
noticed this feature, but recognized it at once when
pointed out to them. Beside this trunkless head is
a headless trunk of equal beauty—a female figure
without arms, and draped with exquisite grace, in a
<pb n='419'/><anchor id='Pg419'/>manner closely resembling the famous Venus of
Melos. The figure has one foot slightly raised, and
set upon a duck, as is quite plain from the general
form of the bird, though the webbed feet are much
worn away, and the head gone. M. Émile Burnouf
told me that this attribute of a duck would determine
it to be either Athene or Artemis. If so,
the general style of the figure, which is very young
and slight, speaks in favor of its being an Artemis.
I trust photographs of this excellent statue may soon
be made, and that it may become known to art students
in Europe.
</p>

<p>
We also noticed a relief larger than life, on a
square block of white marble, of the head of Medusa.
The face is calm and expressionless, exactly the reverse
of Lionardo da Vinci’s matchless painting, but
archaic in character, and of good and clear workmanship.
The head-dress, which has been finished
only on the right side, is very peculiar, and consists
of large scales starting from the forehead, and separating
into two plaits, which become serpents’
bodies, and descend in curves as low as the chin,
then turning upward and outward again, till they
end in well-formed serpents’ heads. The left serpent
is carved out perfectly in relief, but not covered
with scales.
</p>

<p>
I was unable to obtain any trustworthy account
of the finding of these marbles, but they were all
fresh discoveries, especially the Medusa head, which
<pb n='420'/><anchor id='Pg420'/>had been only lately brought to the museum, when
we were first at Argos. Future visitors will find this
valuable collection much increased; and here in this
important town it is advisable that there should be a
local museum.
</p>

<p>
If we look at Dorian art, as contrasted with
Ionian, there can be no doubt that the earliest centre
was Corinth in the Peloponnesus, to which various
discoveries in art are specially ascribed. In architecture,
there were many leading ideas, such as the
setting up of clay figures in the tympanum of their
temples, and the use of panels or soffits, as they
were called, in ceilings, which came first from Corinth.
But when we descend to better-known times,
there are three other Dorian states which quite
eclipse Corinth, I suppose because the trading instinct,
as is sometimes the case, crushed out or
weakened her enthusiasm for art. These states are
Ægina, Sikyon, and Argos. Sikyon rose to greatness
under the gentle and enlightened despotism of
Orthagoras and his family, of whom it was noticed
that they retained their sovereignty longer than any
other dynasty of despots in Greece. Ægina seems
to have disputed the lead with Corinth as a commercial
mart, from the days of Pheidon, whose coinage
of money was always said to have been first practised
at Ægina.<note place="foot">This fact strengthens my conviction that at an early period
Ægina worked the silver-mines of Laurium.</note> The prominence of Ægina in
<pb n='421'/><anchor id='Pg421'/>Pindar’s Epinikian Odes shows not only how eagerly
men practised athletics, and loved renown there, but
how well able they were to pay for expensive monuments
of their fame. Their position in the Persian
war, among the bravest of the Greeks, corroborates
the former part of my statement; the request of an
Ionian Greek lady, captured in the train of Mardonius,
to be transported to Ægina, adds evidence
for the second, as it shows that, to a person of this
description, Ægina was the field for a rich harvest,
and we wonder how its reputation can have
been greater in this respect than that of Corinth.<note place="foot">Cf. Pindar’s frag. for the Corinthian <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἑταίραι</foreign>.</note>
But, a short time after, the rise of the Athenian
naval power crushed the greatness of Ægina, and it
sank into insignificance, and was absorbed into the
Attic power.
</p>

<p>
Thus Sikyon and Argos remained, and it was precisely
these two towns which produced a special
school of art, of which Polycletus was the most distinguished
representative. Dorian sculpture had
originally started with figures of athletes, which
were dedicated at the temples, and were a sort of
collateral monument to the odes of poets—more
durable, no doubt, in the minds of the offerers, but,
as time has shown, perishable and gone, while the
winged words of the poet have not lost even the first
bloom of their freshness. However, in contrast to
the flowing robes and delicately-chiselled features of
<pb n='422'/><anchor id='Pg422'/>the Ionic school, the Dorians reproduced the naked
human figure with great accuracy; while in the face
they adhered to a stiff simplicity, regardless of individual
features, and still more regardless of any expression
save that of a vacant smile. This type,
found in its most perfect development in the Æginetan
marbles, was what lay before Polycletus, when
he rose to greatness. He was the contemporary and
rival of Phidias, and is said to have defeated him in
a competition for the temple of Hera at Samos,
where two or three of the greatest sculptors modelled
a wounded Amazon, and Polycletus was adjudged
the first place. There is some probability that one
of the Amazons now in the Vatican is a copy of this
famous work; and, in spite of a clumsily-restored
head and arms, we can see in this figure the great
simplicity and truth of the artist in treating a rather
ungrateful subject—that of a very powerful and
muscular woman.
</p>

<p>
The Argive school, owing to its traditions, affected
single figures much more than groups; and this, no
doubt, was the main contrast between Polycletus
and Phidias—that, however superior the Argive
might be in a single figure, the genius of the Athenian
was beyond all comparison in using sculpture
for groups and processions as an adjunct to architecture.
But there was also in the sitting statue of
Zeus, at Olympia, a certain majesty which seems
not to have been equalled by any other known
sculp<pb n='423'/><anchor id='Pg423'/>tor. The Attic artist who appears, however, to have
been much nearer to Polycletus in style was Myron,
whose <hi rend='italic'>Discobolus</hi> has reached us in some splendid
copies, and who seems to have had all the Dorian
taste for representing single athletic figures with
more life and more daring action about them than
was attempted by Polycletus.<note place="foot">The bronze cow of Myron seems also to have been a wonderfully
admired work, to judge from the crowd of epigrams written
upon it, which still survive.</note>
</p>

<p>
Herodotus notices somewhere that, at a certain
period, the Argives were the most renowned in
Greece for music. It is most unfortunate that our
knowledge of this branch of Greek art is so fragmentary
that we are wholly unable to tell in what
the Argive proficiency consisted. We are never
told that the Doric scale was there invented; but,
very possibly, they may have taken the lead among
their brethren in this direction also, for it is well
known that the Spartans, though excellent judges,
depended altogether upon foreigners to make music
for them, and thought it not gentlemanly to do more
than criticise.
</p>

<p>
The drive from Argos to Nauplia leads by Tiryns,
then by a great marsh, which is most luxuriously
covered with green and with various flowers, and
then along a good road all the way into the important
and stirring town of Nauplia. This place,
which was one of the oldest settlements, as is proved
<pb n='424'/><anchor id='Pg424'/>by Pelasgic walls and tombs high up on the overhanging
cliffs, was always through history known as
the port of Argos, and is so still, though it rose
under the Turks to the dignity of capital of the
whole province of Greece. The citadel has at all
times been considered almost impregnable. The
situation of the town is exceptionally beautiful, even
for a Greek town; and the sunset behind the
Arcadian mountains, seen from Nauplia, with the
gulf in the foreground, is a view which no man can
ever forget.
</p>

<p>
A coasting steamer, which goes right round all the
Peloponnesus, took us up with a great company,
which was hurrying to Athens for the elections, and
carried us round the coast of Argolis, stopping at the
several ports on the way. This method of seeing
either Greece or Italy is highly to be commended,
and it is a great pity that so many people adhere
strictly to the quickest and most obvious route, so
missing many of the really characteristic features in
the country which they desire to study. Thus the
Italian coasting steamers, which go up from Messina
by Naples to Genoa, touch at many not insignificant
places (such as Gaeta), which no ordinary tourist
ever sees, and which are nevertheless among the
most beautiful in all the country. The same may
be said of the sail from Nauplia to Athens, which
leads you to Spezza, Hydra, or Idra, as they now
<pb n='425'/><anchor id='Pg425'/>call it, to Poros and to Ægina, all very curious and
interesting places to visit.

<p>
The island of Hydra was, in old days, a mere
barren rock, scarcely inhabited, and would probably
never have changed its reputation but for a pirate
settlement in a very curious little harbor, with
a very narrow entrance, which faces the main
shore of Argolis. As you sail along the straight
coast line, there seems no break or indentation,
when suddenly, as if by magic, the rocky shore
opens for about twenty yards, at a spot marked by
several caves in the face of the cliff, and lets you
see into a circular harbor of very small dimensions,
with an amphitheatre of rich and well-built houses
rising up all round the bay. Though the water is
very deep, there is actually no room for a large fleet,
and there seems not a yard of level ground, except
where terraces have been artificially made. High
rocks on both sides of the narrow entrance hide all
prospect of the town, except from the point directly
opposite the entrance.
</p>

<p>
The Hydriotes, who were rich merchants, and, I
suppose, successful pirates in the Turkish days, were
never enslaved, but kept their liberty and their
wealth by paying a tribute to the Porte. They
developed a trading power which reminds one
strongly of the old Greek cities; and so faithful
were they to one another that it was an ordinary
habit for citizens to entrust all their savings to a
<pb n='426'/><anchor id='Pg426'/>captain starting for a distant port, to be laid out by
him to the best advantage. It is said that they were
never defrauded of their profits. The Turks may,
perhaps, have thought that by gentle treatment they
would secure the fidelity of the Hydriotes, whose
wealth and power depended much on Turkish protection;
but they were greatly mistaken. There
was, indeed, some hesitation among the islanders,
when the War of Liberation broke out, what part
they should take; for during the great Napoleonic
wars the Hydriotes, sailing under the neutral flag of
Turkey, had made enormous profits by carrying trade
among the belligerents. They lived in great luxury.
With the peace of 1815, and the reopening of the
French and other ports to English ships, these
profits disappeared, and the extravagant hopes of
the Hydriotes ended in bankruptcy. This was
probably a main cause of their patriotism. However,
by far the most brilliant feats in the war were
those performed by the Hydriote sailors, who remind
one very much of the Zealanders in the wars of
Holland against the Spanish power. Whether their
bravery has been exaggerated is hard to say: this,
at all events, is clear, that they earned the respect and
admiration of the whole nation, nor is there any nobility
so recognized in Greek society as descent from
the Hydriote chiefs who fought for the Liberation.
</p>

<p>
With the rise of the nation the wealth and importance
of Hydra has strangely decayed.
Prob<pb n='427'/><anchor id='Pg427'/>ably the Peiræus, with its vast advantages, has
naturally regained its former predominance, now
that every part of the coast and every port are
equally free. Still, the general style and way of
living at Hydra reminds one of old times; and if
the island itself be sterile, the rich slopes of the
opposite coast, covered with great groves of lemon-trees,
are owned by the wealthy descendants of the
old merchants.
</p>

<p>
The neighboring island of Spezza, where the
steamer waits, and a crowd of picturesque people
come out in quaint boats to give and take cargo,
has a history very parallel to that of Hydra. It is
to be noted that the population of both islands is
rather Albanian than Greek. A few hours brings
the steamer past Poros and through narrow passages
among islands to Ægina, as they now call it. We
have here an island whose history is precisely the
reverse of that of Hydra. The great days of
Ægina (as I mentioned above) were in very old
times, from the age of Pheidon of Argos, in the
seventh century <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>, up to the rise of Athens’s
democracy and navy, when this splendid centre of
literature, art, and commerce was absorbed in the
greater Athenian empire.
</p>

<p>
There is at present a considerable town on the
coast, and some cultivation on the hills; but the
whole aspect of the island is very rocky and barren,
and as it can hardly ever have been otherwise, we
<pb n='428'/><anchor id='Pg428'/>feel at once that the early greatness of Ægina was,
like that of Hydra in the last century, a purely
commercial greatness. The people are very hospitable
and interesting. Nowhere in Greece did I
see more apparent remains of the purest Greek
type. Our hostess, in particular, was worthy to
take her place in the Parthenon frieze, and among
the children playing on the quay there were faces
of marvellous beauty.
</p>

<p>
With enterprise and diligence, a trading nation or
city may readily become great in a small island or
barren coast, and no phenomenon in history proves
this more strongly than the vast empire of the
Phœnicians, who seem never to have owned more
than a bare tract of a few miles about Tyre and
Sidon. They were, in fact, a great people without
a country. The Venetians similarly raised an
empire on a salt marsh, and at one time owned
many important possessions on Greek coasts and
islands, without <q>any visible means of subsistence,</q>
as they say in the police courts. In the same way,
Pericles thought nothing of the possession of Attica,
provided the Athenians could hold their city walls
and their harbors. He knew that with a maritime
supremacy they must necessarily be lords of so vast
a stretch of coasts and islands that the barren hills
of Attica might be completely left out of account.
</p>

<p>
There is yet another and a very interesting way
from Nauplia to Ægina, which may be strongly
<pb n='429'/><anchor id='Pg429'/>recommended to the traveller who does not arrive
in due time to catch the weekly steamer. Horses
can be hired at Nauplia, which can perform, in about
seven hours, the journey to the little village of Epidauros
(now pronounced <hi rend='italic'>Epídavros</hi>). Here a boat
can be obtained, which, with a fair wind, can reach
Ægina in three, and the Peiræus in about six hours.
But, like all boating expeditions, this trip is uncertain,
and may be thwarted by either calm or storm.
</p><anchor id="ill428"/><index index="fig" level1="Sculptured Lion, Nauplia"/>
<pgIf output='txt'><then>
  <p rend="ill">[Illustration: Sculptured Lion, Nauplia]</p>

  <p><figure url="images/illus496.jpg" rend="w100"><head>Sculptured Lion, Nauplia</head><figDesc>Sculptured Lion, Nauplia</figDesc></figure></p>
</else></pgIf>
<p>
We left Nauplia on a very fine morning, while the
shepherds from the country were going through the
streets, shouting <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">γάλα</foreign>, and serving out their milk
from skins, of which they held the neck in one hand,
and loosened their hold slightly to pour it into the
vessel brought to them by the customer. These
picturesque people—men, women, and children—seem
to drive an active trade, and yet are not, I
believe, to be found in the streets of any other
Greek town.
</p>

<p>
The way through the Argolic country is rough
and stony, not unlike in character to the ride from
Corinth to Mycenæ, but more barren, and for the
most part less picturesque. On some of the hilltops
are old ruins, with fine remains of masonry, apparently
old Greek work. The last two or three hours
of the journey are, however, particularly beautiful,
as the path goes along the course of a rich glen, in
which a tumbling river hurries toward the sea.
This glen is full of verdure and of trees. We saw
<pb n='430'/><anchor id='Pg430'/>it in the richest moment of a southern spring, when
all the trees were bursting into leaf, or decked with
varied bloom. It was the home, too, of thrushes,
and many other singing birds, which filled the air
with music—as it were a rich variation upon the
monotonous sound of the murmuring river. There
is no sweeter concert than this in nature, no union
of sight and sound which fills the heart of the
stranger in such a solitude with deeper gladness.
I know no fitter exodus from the beautiful Morea—a
farewell journey which will dwell upon the
memory, and banish from the mind all thoughts of
discomfort and fatigue.
</p>

<p>
In the picturesque little land-locked bay of Epidavros
there was a good-sized fishing-boat riding at
anchor, which we immediately chartered to convey
us to Athens. The skipper took some time to
gather a crew, and to obtain the necessary papers
from the local authorities, but after some pressure
on our part we got under weigh with a fair wind,
and ran out of the harbor into the broad rock-studded
sheet of water which separates Argolis
from Ægina, and from the more distant coast of
Attica. There is no more delightful or truly Greek
mode of travelling than to run through islands and
under rocky coasts in these boats, which are roomy
and comfortable, and, being decked, afford fair shelter
from shower or spray. But presently the wind
began to increase from the north-west, and our
<pb n='431'/><anchor id='Pg431'/>skipper to hesitate whether it were safe to continue
the journey. He proposed to run into the
harbor of Ægina for the night. We acquiesced
without demur, and went at a great pace to our
new destination. But no sooner had we come into
the harbor, and cast anchor, so that the boat lay
steady with her head to the wind, than another
somewhat larger boat which came sailing in after
us ran right into her amidships. The shock started
up all my companions, who were lying asleep in the
bottom of the boat, and the situation looked rather
desperate, for we were in the middle of a large
harbor, a long way from land. It was night, and
blowing hard, and all our crew betook themselves
to weeping and praying, while the other boat did
her best to sheer off and leave us to our fate.
However, some of us climbed into her by the bow-sprit,
which lay across our deck, while others got
up the baggage, and proceeded to examine at what
pace the water was coming in. A boat from the
shore came out in time to take us off safely, but
when we had landed our skipper gravely proposed
that we should pay for the boat, as she was injured
in our service! Of course, we laughed him to scorn,
and having found at Ægina a steam-launch belonging
to Captain Miaoulis, then Minister of Marine,
we went in search of him, and besought him to take
us next day to the Peiræus. The excellent man
not only granted our request, but entertained us on
<pb n='432'/><anchor id='Pg432'/>the way with the most interesting anecdotes of his
stay in England as a boy, when he came with his
father to seek assistance from our country during
the War of Liberation. Thus we came into the
Peiræus, not as shipwrecked outcasts, but under the
protection of one of the most gallant and distinguished
officers of the Greek navy.
</p>

<p>
A great point of interest among newly-discovered
sites is the great temple and theatre of Epidaurus,
which I did not visit, on account of an epidemic of
small-pox—<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">εὐφλογία</foreign> they call it, euphemistically.
The very journey to this place is worth making,
on account of its intensely characteristic features.
You start from Athens in a coasting steamer full
of natives, who carry with them their food and beds,
and camp on deck where it pleases them, regardless
of class. You see all the homeliness of ordinary
life obtruded upon you without seeking it, instead
of intruding upon others to find it; and you can
study not only the country, but the people, at great
leisure. But the ever-varying beauty of the scene
leaves little time for other studies. The boat passes
along Ægina, and rounds the promontory of Kalauria—the
death-scene of Demosthenes—into the land-locked
bay of Poros, where lay the old Trœzen and
Hermione along the fruitful shore, surrounded by an
amphitheatre of lofty mountains. The sea is like a
fair inland lake, studded with white sails, and framed
with the rich green of vines and figs and growing
<pb n='433'/><anchor id='Pg433'/>corn. Even the rows of tall solemn cypresses can
suggest no gloom in such a landscape. From here
it is but a short ride to the famous temple of Æsculapius,
though most people go from Nauplia, as I
once did in former years, before the discoveries were
made which now attract the student.
</p>

<p>
The excavations of the Greek archæological
society have laid bare at least three principal buildings
in connection with the famous spot; the old
temple of the god, the theatre, and the famous <hi rend='italic'>tholos</hi>,
a circular building, in which those who had been
healed of diseases set up votive tablets. The extraordinary
size and splendor of the theatre—Pausanias
says it was far the finest in Greece—rather contrasts
with the dimensions of the temple, and suggests
that most of the patients who came were able
to enjoy themselves, or else that many people came
for pleasure, and not on serious business. The remains
discovered are particularly valuable for the
good preservation of the stage, but of this I can
only speak at second hand. So also the circular
building, which was erected under the supervision
of the famous Polycletus, the great Argive sculptor,
a rival of Phidias, has many peculiar features, and
shows in one more instance that what earlier art
critics assumed as modern was based on older classical
models. Circular buildings supported on pillars
were thought rather Græco-Roman than Greek, but
here we see that, like the builders of the Odeon of
<pb n='434'/><anchor id='Pg434'/>Pericles, of the later Philippeion at Olympia, so the
Epidaurians had this form before them from early
days. Inside the outer row of Doric pillars was a
second circle of pillars, apparently Ionic as to proportions
and fluting, but the capitals were Corinthian,
so that this feature also in architecture has a venerable
antiquity, and was not Græco-Roman, as was
once supposed. For a long time the so-called
Lantern of Demosthenes, built for Lysicrates at
Athens in 335 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>, when Alexander was leading his
army into Asia, was considered the oldest, and perhaps
the only pure Greek example of the Corinthian
capital. People began to hesitate when a solitary
specimen was found in the famous temple of Bassæ,
where it could hardly have been imported in later
days. Now the evidence is completed, and in this
respect the historians of art are correcting the rash
generalization of their predecessors.

Whatever other excursions a traveller may make
in the Morea, he ought not to omit a trip to Sparta,
which has so often been the centre of power, and is
still one of the chief centres of attraction in Greece.
And yet many reasons conspire to make this famous
place less visited than the rest of the country. It is
distinctly out of the way from the present starting-points
of travel. To reach it from Athens, or even
from Patras or Corinth, requires several days, and it
is not remarkable for any of those architectural remains
which are more attractive to the modern
inquirer than anything else in a historic country.
</p>

<p>
Of the various routes we choose (in 1884) that
from Nauplia by Astros, as we had been the guests
for some days of the hospitable Dr. Schliemann, who
was prosecuting his now famous researches at Tiryns.
So we rose one morning with the indefatigable doctor
before dawn,<note place="foot">Cf. the account of his habits in his work, <hi rend='italic'>Tiryns</hi>, cap. I.</note> and took a boat to bring us down
the coast to Astros. The morning was perfectly fair
and calm, and the great mountain chains of the coast
were mirrored in the opal sea, as we passed the
pic<pb n='436'/><anchor id='Pg436'/>turesque rocky fort which stands close to Nauplia
in the bay, the residence of the public executioner.
The beauty of the Gulf of Argos never seemed
more perfect than in the freshness of the morning,
with the rising sun illuminating the lofty coasts.
Our progress was at first by the slow labor of the oar,
but as the morning advanced there came down a
fresh west wind from the mountains, which at intervals
filled our lateen sail almost too well, and sent
us flying along upon our way. In three hours we
rounded a headland, and found ourselves in the pretty
little bay of Astros.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the whole population came down to see
us. They were apparently as idle, and as ready to
be amused, as the inhabitants of an Irish village.
But they are sadly wanting in fun. You seldom
hear them make a joke or laugh, and their curiosity
is itself curious from this aspect. After a good deal
of bargaining we agreed for a set of mules and
ponies to bring us all the way round the Morea, to
Corinth if necessary, though ultimately we were glad
to leave them at Kyparissia, at the opposite side of
Peloponnesus, and pursue our way by sea. The
bargain was eight drachmas per day for each animal;
a native, or very experienced traveller, could
have got them for five to six drachmas.
</p>

<p>
Our way led us up a river course, as usual
through fine olive-trees and fields of corn, studded
with scarlet anemones, till after a mile or two we
<pb n='437'/><anchor id='Pg437'/>began to ascend from the level of the coast to the
altitudes of the central plateau, or rather mountain
system, of the Morea. Here the flora of the coast
gave way to fields of sperge, hyacinths, irises, and
star of Bethlehem. Every inch of ascent gave us
a more splendid and extended view back over coasts
and islands. The giant tops of the inner country
showed themselves still covered with snow. We
were in that district so little known in ancient history,
which was so long a bone of contention between
Argos and Sparta, whose boundaries seem never to
have been fixed by any national landmark. When
we had reached the top of the rim of inland Alps,
we ascended and descended various steeps, and
rounded many glens, reaching in the end the village
of Hagios Petros, which we had seen before us
for a long time, while we descended one precipice
and mounted another to attain our goal. It was
amusing to see our <hi rend='italic'>agogiatæ</hi> or muleteers pulling out
fragments of mirror, and arranging their toilette,
such as it was, before encountering the criticism of
the Hagiopetrans. One of these men was indeed a
handsome soldierly youth, who walked all day with
us for a week over the roughest country, in miserable
shoes, and yet without apparent fatigue.
</p>

<p>
Another, a great stout man with a beard, excused
himself for not being married by saying he was <hi rend='italic'>too
little</hi> (<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">εἶναι μικρός</foreign>), and so we learned that as they
are all expected to marry, and do marry, twenty-five
<pb n='438'/><anchor id='Pg438'/>is considered the earliest proper age. One would
almost think they had preserved some echo of Aristotle’s
views, which make thirty years the best age
for marriage—thirty years! when most of us are
already so old as to have lost interest in these great
pleasures.
</p>

<p>
At Hagios Petros we were hospitably received by
the demarch, a venerable old man with a white
beard, who was a physician, unfortunately also a
politician, and who insisted on making a thousand
inquiries about Mr. Gladstone and Prince Bismarck,
while we were starving and longing for dinner.
Some fish, which the muleteers had providently
bought at Astros and brought with them, formed the
best part of the entertainment, if we except the
magnificent creature, adorned in all his petticoats
and colors and knives, who came in to see us before
dinner, and kissed our hands with wonderful dignity,
but who turned out to be the waiter at the
table. We asked the demarch how he had procured
himself so stately a servant, and he said he was the
clerk in his office. It occurred to us, when we
watched the grace and dignity of every movement
in this royal-looking person, how great an effect
splendid costume seems to have on manners. It
was but a few days since that I had gone to a very
fashionable evening party at a handsome palace in
Athens, and had been amused at the extraordinary
awkwardness with which various very learned
men<pb n='439'/><anchor id='Pg439'/>—professors, archæologists, men of independent
means—had entered the room. The circle was,
I may add, chiefly German. Here was a man,
ignorant, acting as a servant and yet a king in
demeanor. But how could you expect a German
professor in his miserable Frankish dress to assume
the dignity of a Greek in palicar costume, in forty
yards of petticoat, his waist squeezed with female
relentlessness, with his ruby jacket and gaiters, his
daggers and pistols at his belt. After all, manners
are hardly attainable, as a rule, without costume.
</p>

<p>
We were accommodated as well as the worthy
demarch could manage for the night. As a special
favor I was put to sleep into his dispensary, a little
chamber full of galley-pots, pestles, and labelled
bottles of antiquated appearance, and dreamt in
turns of the study of Faust and of the apothecary’s
shop in Mantua, which we see upon the stage.
</p>

<p>
Early in the morning we climbed up a steep
ascent to attain the high plateau, very bleak and
bare, which is believed by the people to have been
the scene of the conflict of Othryades and his men
with the Argive 300. A particular spot is still
called <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">στοὺς φονευμένους</foreign>, <hi rend='italic'>the place of the slain</hi>.
The high plain, about 3500 feet above the sea,
was all peopled with country-folk coming to a
market at Hagios Petros, and we had ample opportunity
of admiring both the fine manly appearance
and the excellent manners of this hardy and free
<pb n='440'/><anchor id='Pg440'/>peasantry. The complex of mountains in which
they live is the chain of Parnon, which ultimately
extends from Thyreatis through Kynuria down to
Cape Malea, but not without many breaks and
crossings. The heights of Parnon (now called
Malevo) still hid from us the farther Alps of the
inner country.
</p>

<p>
After a ride of an hour or two we descended to
the village of Arachova, much smaller and poorer
than its namesake in Phocis (above, <ref target="Pg274">p. 274)</ref>, and
thence to the valley of a stream called Phonissa,
the murderess, from its dangerous floods, but at the
moment a pleasant and shallow brook. Down its
narrow bed we went for hours, crossing and recrossing
it, or riding along its banks, with all the verdure
gradually increasing with the change of climate and
of shelter, till at last a turn in the river brought us
suddenly in sight of the brilliant serrated crest of
Taygetus, glittering with its snow in the sunshine.
Then we knew our proper landmark, and felt that
we were indeed approaching Sparta.
</p>

<p>
But we still had a long way to ride down our
river till we reached its confluence with the Eurotas,
near to which we stopped at a solitary khan, from
which it is an easy ride to visit the remains of Sellasia.
During the remaining three hours we descended
the banks of the Eurotas, with the country
gradually growing richer, and the stream so deep
that it could no longer be forded. There is a quaint
<pb n='441'/><anchor id='Pg441'/>high mediæval bridge at the head of the vale of
Sparta. On a hot summer’s afternoon, about five
o’clock, we rode, dusty and tired, into Sparta.
</p>

<p>
The town was in holiday, and athletic sports were
going on in commemoration of the establishment of
Greek liberty. Crowds of fine tall men were in the
very wide regular streets, and in the evening this
new town vindicated its ancient title of <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">εὐρύχορος</foreign>.
But the very first glance at the surroundings of the
place was sufficient to correct in my mind a very
widespread error, which we all obtain from reading
the books of people who have never studied history
on the spot. We imagine to ourselves the Spartans
as hardy mountaineers, living in a rude alpine country,
with sterile soil, the rude nurse of liberty.
They may have been such when they arrived in
prehistoric times from the mountains of Phocis,
but a very short residence in Laconia must have
changed them very much. The vale of Sparta is
the richest and most fertile in Peloponnesus. The
bounding chains of mountains are separated by a
stretch, some twenty miles wide, of undulating hills
and slopes, all now covered with vineyards, orange
and lemon orchards, and comfortable homesteads or
villages. The great chain on the west limits the
vale by a definite line, but toward the east the hills
that run toward Malea rise very gradually and with
many delays beyond the arable ground. The old
Spartans therefore settled in the richest and best
<pb n='442'/><anchor id='Pg442'/>country available, and must from the very outset of
their career have had better food, better climate, and
hence much more luxury than their neighbors.
</p>

<p>
We are led to the same conclusion by the art-remains
which are now coming to light, and which
are being collected in the well-built local museum of
the town. They show us that there was an archaic
school of sculpture, which produced votive and
funeral reliefs, and therefore that the old Spartans
were by no means so opposed to art as they have
been represented in the histories. The poetry of
Alkman, with its social and moral freedom, its
suggestions of luxury and good living, shows what
kind of literature the Spartan rulers thought fit to
import and encourage in the city of Lycurgus. The
whole sketch of Spartan society which we read in
Plutarch’s <hi rend='italic'>Life</hi> and other late authorities seems
rather to smack of imaginary reconstruction on
Doric principles than of historical reality. Contrasts
there were, no doubt, between Dorians and Ionians,
nay, even between Sparta and Tarentine or Argive
Dorians; but still Sparta was a rich and luxurious
society, as is confessed on all hands where there is
any mention of the ladies and their homes. We
might as well infer from the rudeness of the dormitories
in the College at Winchester, or from the
simplicity of an English man-of-war’s mess, that our
nation consisted of rude mountaineers living in the
sternest simplicity.
</p>

<pb n='443'/><anchor id='Pg443'/>

<p>
But if I continue to write in this way I shall have
all the pedants down upon me. Let us return to the
Sparta of to-day. We lodged at a very bad and dear
inn, and our host’s candid excuse for his exorbitant
prices was the fact that he very seldom had strangers
to rob, and so must plunder those that came without
stint. His formula was perhaps a little more decent,
but he hardly sought to disguise the plain truth.
When we sought our beds, we found that a very
noisy party had established themselves below to
celebrate the Feast of the Liberation, with supper,
speeches, and midnight revelry.
</p>

<p>
So, as usual, there was little possibility of sleep.
Moreover, I knew that we had a very long day’s
journey before us to Kalamata, so I rose before the
sun and before my companions, to make preparations
and to rouse the muleteers.
</p>

<p>
On opening my window, I felt that I had attained
one of the strange moments of life which can never
be forgotten. The air was preternaturally clear and
cold, and the sky beginning to glow faintly with the
coming day. Straight before me, so close that it
almost seemed within reach of voice, the giant
Taygetus, which rises straight from the plain, stood
up into the sky, its black and purple gradually
brightening into crimson, and the cold blue-white
of its snow warming into rose. There was a great
feeling of peace and silence, and yet a vast diffusion
of sound. From the whole plain, with all its
home<pb n='444'/><anchor id='Pg444'/>steads and villages, myriads of cocks were proclaiming
the advent of the dawn. I had never thought
there were so many cocks in all the world. The
ever-succeeding voices of these countless thousands
kept up one continual wave of sound, such as I suppose
could not be equalled anywhere else; and yet
for all that, as I have said, there was a feeling of
silence, a sense that no other living thing was
abroad, an absolute stillness in the air, a deep sleep
over the rest of nature.
</p>

<p>
How long I stood there, and forgot my hurry, I
know not, but starting up at last as the sun struck
the mountain, I went down, and found below stairs
another curious contrast. All over the coffee-room
(if I may so dignify it) were the disordered remains
of a disorderly revel, ashes and stains and fragments
in disgusting confusion; and among them a solitary
figure was mumbling prayers in the gloom to the
image of a saint with a faint lamp burning before it.
In the midst of the wrecks of dissipation was the
earnestness of devotion, prayer in the place of
ribaldry; perhaps, too, dead formalism in the place
of coarse but real enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
We left for Mistra before six in the morning, so
escaping some of the parting inspection which the
whole town was ready to bestow upon us. The way
led us past many orchards, where oranges and lemons
were growing in the richest profusion on great trees,
as large as the cherry-trees in the Alps. The
<pb n='445'/><anchor id='Pg445'/>branches were bending with their load, and there
was fruit tumbled into the grass, and studding the
ground in careless plenty with its ruddy and pale
gold. In these orchards, with their deep green
masses of foliage, the nightingales sing all day, and
we heard them out-carolling the homelier sounds of
awakening husbandry. During all the many rides I
have taken through Greece, no valley ever struck
me with the sense of peace and wealth so much as
that of Sparta.
</p>

<p>
After an hour or so we reached the picturesque
town of Mistra, now nearly deserted, but all through
the Middle Ages the capital of the district, nestled
under the shelter of the great fortress of the Villehardouins,
the family of the famous chronicler. Separated
by a deep gorge (or <hi rend='italic'>langada</hi>) with its torrent
from the loftier mountain, this picturesque rock with
its fortress contains the most remarkable mediæval
remains, Latin, Greek, Venetian, Turkish, in all the
Morea. Villehardouins and Paleologi made it their
seat of power, and filled it with churches and palaces,
to which I shall return when we speak of mediæval
Greece. An earthquake about fifty years ago destroyed
many of the houses, and the population
then founded the new Sparta, with its wide, regular
streets, on the site of the old classical city. This
resettlement is not so serious a hindrance to archæology
as the rebuilding of Athens, for we know that
in the days of its real greatness Sparta was a mere
<pb n='446'/><anchor id='Pg446'/>aggregate of villages, and the walls and theatre
which are still visible must have been built in late
Greek or Roman times. The so-called tomb of
Leonidas, a square chamber built with huge blocks
of ashlar masonry, of which three courses remain,
appears like building of the best period, but its history
is wholly unknown.
</p>

<p>
We reached in another hour the steep village of
Trypi, at the very mouth of the great pass through
Taygetus—a beautiful site, with houses and forest
trees standing one above the other on the precipitous
steep; and below, the torrent rushing into the
plain to join the Eurotas. It is from this village
that we ought to have started at dawn, and where
we should have spent the previous night, for even
from here it takes eleven full hours to reach Kalamata
on the Gulf of Messene. The traveller should
send on his ponies, or take them to Mistra and
thence to Trypi on the previous afternoon. The
lodging there is probably not much worse than at
Sparta.
</p>

<p>
From this point we entered at once into the great
Langada pass, the most splendid defile in Greece—the
only way from Sparta into Messene for a distance
of thirty miles north and south. It is indeed possible
to scale the mountain at a few other points, but
only by regular alpine climbing, whereas this is a
regular highway; and along it strings of mules,
not without trouble, make their passage daily, when
<pb n='447'/><anchor id='Pg447'/>the snow does not lie, from Sparta and from Kalamata.
</p><anchor id="ill446"/><index index="fig" level1="Langada Pass"/>

  <p><figure url="images/illus516.jpg" rend="w100"><head>Langada Pass</head><figDesc>Langada Pass</figDesc></figure></p>
</else></pgIf>
<p>
Nothing can exceed the picturesqueness and
beauty of this pass, and nothing was stranger
than the contrast between its two steeps. That
which faced south was covered with green and with
spring flowers—pale anemones, irises, orchids, violets,
and, where a stream trickled down, with primroses—a
marsh plant in this country. All these
were growing among great boulders and cliffs,
whereas on the opposite side the whole face was
bleak and barren, the rocks being striated with rich
yellow and red veins. I suppose in hot summer
these aspects are reversed. High above us, as it
were, looking down from the summits, were great
forests of fir-trees—a gloomy setting to a grandiose
and savage landscape. The day was, as usual, calm
and perfectly fine, with a few white clouds relieving
the deep blue of the sky. As we were threading
our way among the rocks of the river-course we
were alarmed by large stones tumbling from above,
and threatening to crush us. Our guides raised all
the echoes with their shouts, to warn any unconscious
disturber of this solitude that there were
human beings beneath, but on closer survey we
found that our possible assassins were only goats
clambering along the precipice in search of food,
and disturbing loose boulders as they went.
</p>

<p>
Farther on we met other herds of these quaint
<pb n='448'/><anchor id='Pg448'/>creatures generally tended by a pair of solitary children,
who seemed to belong to no human kin, but,
like birds or flowers, to be the natural denizens of
these wilds. They seemed not to talk or play; we
never heard them sing, but passed them sitting in
curious vague listlessness, with no wonder, no curiosity,
in their deep solemn eyes. There, all the day
long, they heard no sound but the falling water, the
tinkling of their flocks, and the great whisper of the
forest pines when the breeze touched them on its
way down the pass. They took little heed of us as
we passed, and seemed to have sunk from active
beings into mere passive mirrors of the external
nature around them. The men with us, on the other
hand, were constantly singing and talking. They
were all in a strange country which they had never
seen; a serious man with a gun slung around his
shoulder was our guide from Trypi, and so at last we
reached the top of the pass, about four thousand feet
high, marked by a little chapel to St. Elias, and once
by a stone pillar stating the boundary between Sparta
and Messene. It was then up this pass, and among
these forests, that the young Spartans had steeled
themselves by hunting the wolf and the bear in
peace, and by raids and surprises in days of war.
</p>

<p>
The descent was longer and more varied; sometimes
through well cultivated olive yards, mulberries,
and thriving villages, sometimes along giant slopes,
where a high wind would have made our progress
<pb n='449'/><anchor id='Pg449'/>very difficult. Gradually the views opened and extended,
and in the evening we could see down to the
coast of Messene, and the sea far away. But we
did not reach Kalamata till long after nightfall, and
rested gladly in a less uncomfortable inn than we had
yet found in the journey.
</p>

<p>
The town is a cheery and pleasant little place,
with remains of a large mediæval castle occupied by
Franks, Venetians, Turks, which was the first seat
of the Villehardouins, and from which they founded
their second fort at Mistra. The river Nedon here
runs into the sea, and there is a sort of open roadstead
for ships, where steamers call almost daily, and
a good deal of coasting trade (silk, currants, etc.)
goes on. The only notable feature in the architecture
is the pretty bell tower of the church, of a type
which I afterward saw in other parts of Messenia,
but which is not usual in these late Byzantine
buildings.
</p>

<p>
As there was nothing to delay us here, we left
next morning for the convent of Vourkano, from
which we were to visit Mount Ithome, and the famous
ruins of Epaminondas’s second great foundation
in Peloponnesus—the revived Messene. The
plain (called <hi rend='italic'>Macaria</hi> or Felix from its fertility)
through which we rode was indeed both rich and
prosperous, but swampy in some places and very
dusty in others. There seemed to be active cultivation
of mulberries, figs, olives, lemons, almonds,
<pb n='450'/><anchor id='Pg450'/>currant-grapes, with cactus hedges and plenty of
cattle. There were numerous little pot-houses along
the road, where mastich and lucumia were sold, as
well as dried fruit and oranges. If the Nedon was
broad and shallow, we found the Pamisos narrow and
deep, so that it could only be crossed by a bridge.
A few hours brought us to the ascent of Mount
Ithome, on a high shoulder of which is situated the
famous and hospitable convent of Vourkano (or
Voulkano).
</p>

<p>
The building, very picturesquely situated high on
the side of Mount Ithome, commands a long slope
covered with brushwood and wild-flowers, the ideal
spot for a botanist, as many rills of water run down
the descent and produce an abundant and various
vegetation. There is not a sod of soil which does
not contain bulbs and roots of flowers. Below
stretches the valley of Stenyclarus, so famous in the
old annals of Messene. It was studded with groves
of orange and lemon, olive and date, mulberry and
fig. The whole of this country has an aspect far
more southern and subtropical than any part of
Laconia.
</p>

<p>
The monks treated us with great kindness, even
pressing us to sit down to dinner before any ablutions
had been thought of, and while we were still
covered with the dust of a very hot and stormy
journey along high roads. The plan of the building,
which is not old, having been moved down from
<pb n='451'/><anchor id='Pg451'/>the summit in the last century, is that of a court
closed with a gateway, with covered corridors
above looking into the court, and a very tawdry
chapel occupying its centre. It seemed a large and
well-to-do establishment, a sort of Greek Monte
Cassino in appearance; and with the same stir of
country people and passing visitors about it. Far
above us, on the summit of Mount Ithome—the site
of human sacrifices to Zeus Ithomates in days of
trouble—we saw a chapel on the highest top, 2500
feet over the sea. Here they told us that a solitary
anchorite spent his life, praying and doing service
at his altar, far above the sounds of human life.
We made inquiry concerning the history of this
saint, who was once a wealthy Athenian citizen,
with a wife and family. His wife was dead, and
his sons settled in the world, so he resolved to
devote the rest of his years to the service of God
apart from the ways of men. Once a fortnight only
he descended to the convent, and brought up the
necessary food. On his lonely watch he had no
company but timid hares, travelling quail, and an
occasional eagle, that came and sat by him without
fear, perhaps in wonder at this curious and silent
friend. The monks below had often urged him to
catch these creatures for their benefit, but he refused
to profane their lofty asylum. So he sits, looking out
from his watch upon sunshine and rain, upon hot calm
and wild storm, with the whole Peloponnesus extended
<pb n='452'/><anchor id='Pg452'/>beneath his eyes. He sees from afar the works and
ways of men, and the world that he has left for ever.
Is it not strange that still upon the same height men
offer to their God these human sacrifices, changed
indeed in appearance, but in real substance the
same?
</p>

<p>
The main excursion from the monastery is over
the saddle of the mountain westward, and through
the <q>Laconian gate</q> down into the valley beneath,
to see the remains of Epaminondas’s great foundation,
the new Messene. There are still faint traces
of a small theatre and some other buildings, but of
the walls and gates enough to tell us pretty clearly
how men built fortifications in those days. The
circuit of the walls included the fort on the summit,
and enclosed a large tract of country, so much that
it would be impossible for any garrison to defend it,
and accordingly we hear of the city being taken by
sudden assault more than once. The plan is very
splendid, but seems to us rather ostentatious than
serious for a new foundation liable to attacks from
Sparta. The walls were, however, beautifully built,
with towers at intervals, and gates for sallies. The
best extant gate is called the Arcadian, and consisted
of an outer and inner pair of folding-doors,
enclosing a large round chamber for the watch.
The size of the doorposts and lintels is gigantic, and
shows that there was neither time nor labor spared
to make Messene a stately settlement. There was
<pb n='453'/><anchor id='Pg453'/>almost enough land enclosed within the walls to feed
the inhabitants of the houses, for their number never
became very great. If Megalopolis, a far more successful
foundation, was far too large for its population,
how much more must this have been the case
with Messene? In military architecture, however,
we have no other specimen of old Hellenic work
equal to it, except perhaps Eleutheræ, which resembles
it in style strongly, though the enclosure
is quite small in comparison.

</else></pgIf>
<p>
We could have gone up from Messene by a very
long day’s ride to Bassæ, and so to Olympia, but we
had had enough of riding and preferred to make a
short day to the sea at Kyparissia, and thence by
steamer to Katakolo, from which rail and road to
Olympia are quite easy. So we left the convent in
the morning and descended into the valley, to turn
north and then north-east, along the river courses
which mark the mule-tracks through the wild
country. We crossed a strange bridge over the
junction of two rivers made of three arches meeting
in the centre, and of which the substructure were
certainly old Greek building. We then passed
through bleak tracts of uncultivated land, perhaps
the most signal case of insufficient population we
had seen in Greece. All these waste fields were
covered with great masses of asphodel, through
which rare herds of swine were feeding, and the
sight of these fields suggested to me that by the
<pb n='454'/><anchor id='Pg454'/><q>meadow of asphodel</q> in Homer is not meant a
pleasant garden, or desirable country, but merely a
dull waste in which there is nothing done, and no
sign of human labor or human happiness. Had
there been night or gloom over this stony tract, with
its tall straggling plants and pale flowers, one could
easily imagine it the place which the dead hero inhabited
when he told his friend that the vilest menial
on earth was happier than he.
</p>

<p>
After some hours the mountains began to approach
on either side, and we reached a country wonderful
in its contrast. Great green slopes reached up from
us far away into the hills, studded with great single
forest trees, and among them huge shrubs of arbutus
and mastich, trimmed and rounded as if for ornament.
It was like a splendid park, kept by an English
magnate. The regularity of shape in the shrubs
arises, no doubt, from the constant cropping of the
young shoots all round by herds of goats, which we
met here and there in this beautiful solitude. The
river bank where we rode was clothed with oleander,
prickly pear, and other flowering shrubs which I
could not name.
</p>

<p>
At last woods of ancient olives, with great gnarled
stems, told us that we were nearing some important
settlement, and the pleasant town of Kyparissia
came in view—now, alas! a heap of ruins since the
recent earthquake. Here we took leave of our
ponies, mules, and human followers; but the pathos
<pb n='455'/><anchor id='Pg455'/>of parting with these intimate companions of many
days was somewhat marred by the divergence of
their notions and ours as to their pay. Yet these
differences, when settled, did not prevent them from
giving us an affectionate farewell.

<head>CHAPTER XV.</head>

<head type="sub">MYCENÆ AND TIRYNS.</head>

<p>
I have set apart a chapter for Mycenæ and
Tiryns, because the discoveries of Dr. Schliemann
there have raised so many new problems, and have
so largely increased public curiosity about them,
that a book of travels in Greece cannot venture to
avoid the subject; even long before Dr. Schliemann’s
day, the learned and deliberate travellers
who visited the Morea, and wrote their great books,
found ample scope for description, and large room
for erudite discussion. It is a curious thing to add,
but strictly true, that all the new facts brought out
by the late excavations have, as yet, contributed but
little to our knowledge about the actual history of
the country, and that almost every word of what was
summed up from all existing sources twenty years
ago, by Ernst Curtius, can still be read with far
more profit than the rash speculations which appear
almost weekly in the periodical press.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible to approach Mycenæ from any
side without being struck with the picturesqueness
of the site. If you come down over the mountains
from Corinth, as soon as you reach the head of the
<pb n='457'/><anchor id='Pg457'/>valley of the Inachus, which is the plain of Argos,
you turn aside to the left, or east, into a secluded
corner—<q>a recess of the horse-feeding Argos,</q> as
Homer calls it, and then you find on the edge of
the valley, and where the hills begin to rise one
behind the other, the village of Charváti. When
you ascend from this place, you find that the lofty
Mount Elias is separated from the plain by two
nearly parallel waves of land, which are indeed
joined at the northern end by a curving saddle,
but elsewhere are divided by deep gorges. The
loftier and shorter wave forms the rocky citadel of
Mycenæ—the Argion, as it was once called. The
lower and longer was part of the outer city, which
occupied both this hill and the gorge under the
Argion. As you walk along the lower hill, you find
the Treasure-house of Atreus, as it is called, built
into the side which faces the Acropolis. But there
are other ruined treasuries on the outer slope, and
the newly-opened one is just at the joining saddle,
where the way winds round to lead you up the
greater hill to the giant gate with the Lion portal.
If we represent the high levels under the image of
a fishing-hook, with the shank placed downward
(south), and the point lying to the right (east), then
the Great Treasury is at that spot in the shank
which is exactly opposite the point, and faces it.
The point and barb are the Acropolis. The New
Treasury is just at the turn of the hook, facing
in<pb n='458'/><anchor id='Pg458'/>ward (to the south). This will give a rough idea
of the site. It is not necessary to enter into details,
when so many maps and plans are now in circulation.
But I would especially refer to the admirable
illustrations in Schliemann’s <hi rend='italic'>Mycenæ</hi>, where all these
matters are made perfectly plain and easy.
</p>

<p>
When we first visited the place it was in the
afternoon of a splendid summer’s day; the fields
were yellow and white with stubbles or with dust,
and the deep gray shadow of a passing cloud was
the only variety in the color of the upper plain.
For here there are now no trees, the corn had been
reaped, and the land asserted its character as <hi rend='italic'>very
thirsty</hi> Argos. But as we ascended to higher
ground, the groves and plantations of the lower
plain came in sight, the splendid blue of the bay
began to frame the picture, and the setting sun cast
deeper shadow and richer color over all the view.
Down at the river-bed great oleanders were spreading
their sheets of bloom, like the rhododendrons in
our climate, but they were too distant to form a
feature in the prospect.
</p>

<p>
I saw the valley of Argos again in spring, in our
<q>roaring moon of daffodil and crocus;</q> it was the
time of growing corn, of scarlet anemone and purple
cistus, but there too of high winds and glancing
shadows. Then all the plain was either brilliant
green with growing wheat, or ruddy brown with
recent tillage; there were clouds about the
moun<pb n='459'/><anchor id='Pg459'/>tains, and changing colors in the sky, and a feeling
of freshness and life very different from the golden
haze and dreamy calmness of a southern June.

<p>
I can hardly say which of these seasons was the
more beautiful, but I shall always associate the summer
scene with the charm of a first visit to this
famous spot, and still more with the venerable and
undisturbed aspect of the ruins before they had been
profaned by modern research. It is, I suppose,
ungrateful to complain of these things, and we must
admit that great discoveries outbalance the æsthetic
damage done to an ancient ruin by digging unsightly
holes and piling mounds of earth about it; but who
can contemplate without sorrow the covering of the
finest piece of the Cyclopean wall at Mycenæ with
the rubbish taken away from over the tombs? Who
will not regret the fig-tree which spread its shade
over the portal of the House of Atreus? This fig-tree
is still to be seen in the older photographs, and
is in the woodcut of the entrance given in Dr. Schliemann’s
book, but the visitor of to-day will look for
it in vain. On the other hand, the opening at the
top, which had been there since the beginning of
this century, but which was closed when I first
visited the chamber, had been again uncovered, and
so it was much easier to examine the inner arrangement
of the building.
</p>

<p>
I am not sure that this wonderful structure was
visited or described by any traveller from the days
<pb n='460'/><anchor id='Pg460'/>of Pausanias till after the year 1800. At least I
can find no description from any former traveller
quoted in the many accurate accounts which the
present century has produced. Chandler, in 1776,
intended to visit Mycenæ, but accidentally missed
the spot on his way from Argos to Corinth—a thing
more likely to happen then, when there was a good
deal of wooding in the upper part of the plain. But
Clarke, Dodwell, and Gell all visited and described
the place between 1800 and 1806, and the latter
two published accurate drawings of both the portal
and the inner view, which was possible owing to
the aperture made at the summit.
</p>

<p>
About the same time Lord Elgin had turned his
attention to the Treasury, and had made excavations
about the place, finding several fragments of very
old engraved basalt and limestone, which had been
employed to ornament the entrance. Some of these
fragments are now in the British Museum. But,
though both Clarke and Leake allude to <q>Lord
Elgin’s excavators,</q> they do not specify what was
performed, or in what condition the place had been
before their researches. There is no published account
of this interesting point, which is probably to
be solved by the still unpublished journals said to be
in the possession of the present Earl.<note place="foot">I have made special inquiries for these, but without any result.
They seem to be lost.</note> This much
is, however, certain, that the chamber was not first
<pb n='461'/><anchor id='Pg461'/>entered at this time; for Dr. Clarke speaks of its
appearance as that of a place open for centuries.
We know that systematic rifling of ancient tombs
took place at the close of the classical epoch;<note place="foot">Cf. <ref target="Pg389">p. 389</ref>, and the outrages of the Galatian mercenaries under
Philip V. of Macedon.</note> we
can imagine it repeated in every age of disorder or
barbarism; and the accounts we hear of the Genoese
plundering the great mounds of the Crimea show
that even these civilized and artistic Italians thought
it no desecration to obtain gold and jewels from unnamed,
long-forgotten sepulchres. It seems, therefore,
impossible to say at what epoch—probably even
before Pausanias—this chamber was opened. The
story in Dr. Schliemann’s book,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Mycenæ</hi>, p. 49.</note> which he quotes
from a Greek newspaper, and which attributes the
plundering of it to Veli Pasha, in 1810, is positively
groundless, and in direct contradiction to the irrefragable
evidence I have above adduced. The Pasha
may have probed the now ruined chambers on the
outer side of the hill; but the account of what he
found is so mythical that the whole story may be
rejected as undeserving of credit.
</p>

<p>
I need not attempt a fresh description of the
Great Treasury, in the face of such ample and
accurate reports as those I have indicated. It is in
no sense a rude building, or one of a helpless and barbarous
age, but, on the contrary, the product of
<pb n='462'/><anchor id='Pg462'/>enormous appliances, and of a perfect knowledge
of all the mechanical requirements for any building,
if we except the application of the arch. The
stones are hewn square, or curved to form the circular
dome within with admirable exactness. Above
the enormous lintel-stone, nearly twenty-seven feet
long, and which is doubly grooved, by way of ornament,
all along its edge over the doorway, there is
now a triangular window or aperture, which was certainly
filled with some artistic carving like the
analogous space over the lintel in the gate of the
Acropolis. Shortly after Lord Elgin had cleared
the entrance, Gell and Dodwell found various pieces
of green and red marble carved with geometrical
patterns, some of which are reproduced in Dodwell’s
book. Gell also found some fragments in a neighboring
chapel, and others are said to be built into a
wall at Nauplia. There are supposed to have been
short columns standing on each side in front of the
gate, with some ornament surmounting them; but
this seems to me to rest on doubtful evidence, and
on theoretical reconstruction. Dr. Schliemann, however,
asserts them to have been found at the entrance
of the second treasury which Mrs. Schliemann excavated,
though his account is somewhat vague
(<hi rend='italic'>Mycenæ</hi>, p. 140). There is the strongest architectural
reason for the triangular aperture over the
door, as it diminishes the enormous weight to be
borne by the lintel; and here, no doubt, some
orna<pb n='463'/><anchor id='Pg463'/>ment very like the lions on the citadel gate may
have been applied.
</p>

<p>
The extreme darkness of the chamber during our
first visit prevented me from discovering, even with
the aid of torches, the nail-marks which all the
earlier travellers found there, and which are now
again easily to be seen. So also the outer lintel-stone
is not by any means the largest, but is far
exceeded by the inner, which lies next to it, and
which reaches on each side of the entrance a long
way round the chamber, its inner surface being
curved to suit the form of the wall. Along this
curve it is twenty-nine feet long; it is, moreover,
seventeen feet broad, and nearly four feet thick,
weighing about one hundred and twenty-four
tons!
</p>

<p>
When we first entered by the light of torches, we
found ourselves in the great cone-shaped chamber,
which, strange to say, reminded me of the Pantheon
at Rome more than any other building I know, and
is, nevertheless, built on a very different principle.
The stones are not, indeed, pushed forward one
above the other, as in ruder stone roofs through
Ireland; but each of them, which is on the other
surfaces cut perfectly square, has its inner face
curved so that the upper end comes out several
inches above the lower. So each stone carries on
the conical plan, having its lower line fitting closely
to the upper line of the one beneath, and the
<pb n='464'/><anchor id='Pg464'/>whole dome ends with a great flat stone laid on the
top.<note place="foot">According to Pausanias, the treasury of Minyas was differently
built; for the top stone of its flat dome was the keystone
(<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἁρμονία</foreign>) of the whole. This is not true. The stone roofs in
Ireland seem to me far more curious in construction, for two
reasons: first, because the stones used are so very small; and
secondly, because there can be, of course, no pressure on a roof
like the pressure brought to bear on a subterranean chamber from
above.</note>
</p>

<p>
Dodwell still found copper nails of some inches in
length, which he supposed to have been used to
fasten on thin plates of shining metal; but I was
at first unable to see even the holes in the roof,
which other travellers had believed to be the places
where the nails were inserted. However, without
being provided with magnesium wire, it was then
impossible to light the chamber sufficiently for a
positive decision on this point. A comparatively
small side chamber is hollowed out in the rock and
earth, without any stone casing or ornament whatever,
but with a similar triangular aperture over its
doorway. Schliemann tells us he dug two trenches
in this chamber, and that, besides finding some
hewn pieces of limestone, he found in the middle a
circular depression (apparently of stone), twenty-one
inches deep, and about one yard in diameter,
which he compares to a large wash-bowl. Any one
who has visited New Grange will be struck with the
likeness of this description to the large stone saucers
<pb n='465'/><anchor id='Pg465'/>which are still to be seen there, and of which I shall
speak presently.
</p>

<p>
There has been much controversy about the use to
which this building was applied, and we cannot now
attempt to change the name, even if we could prove
its absurdity. Pausanias, who saw Mycenæ in the
second century <hi rend='small'>A. D.</hi>, found it in much the same state
as we do, and was no better informed than we,
though he tells us the popular belief that this and
its fellows were treasure-houses like that of the
Minyæ at Orchomenus, which was very much
greater, and was, in his opinion, one of the most
wonderful things in all Greece. But it does not
seem to me that his opinion, which, indeed, is
not very clear, need in the least shackle our judgments.
</p>

<p>
The majority of scholars incline to the theory that
it is a tomb. In the first place, there are three other
similar buildings quite close to it, which Pausanias
mentions as the treasure-houses of the sons of
Atreus, but their number makes it most unlikely
that any of them could be for treasure. Surely
such a house could only be owned by the reigning
king, and there is no reason why his successor
should make himself a new vault for this purpose.
In the next place, these buildings were all underground
and dark, and exactly such as would be
selected for tombs. Thirdly, they are not situated
within the enclosure of the citadel of Mycenæ, but
<pb n='466'/><anchor id='Pg466'/>are outside it, and probably outside the original town
altogether—a thing quite inconceivable if they were
meant for treasure, but most reasonable, and according
to analogy, if they were used as tombs. This,
too, would of course explain the plurality of them—different
kings having built them, just like the
pyramids of Chufu, Safra, and Menkerah, and many
others, along the plain of Memphis in Egypt. It is
even quite easy and natural to explain on this
hypothesis how they came to be thought treasure-houses.
It is known that the sepulchral tumuli of
similar construction in other places, and possibly
built by kindred people, contained much treasure,
left there by way of honor to the deceased.
Herodotus describes this in Scythian tombs, some
of which have been opened of late, and have
verified his assertions.<note place="foot">Cf. Macpherson’s <hi rend='italic'>Antiquities of Kertch</hi>.</note> The lavish expense at
Patroclus’s funeral, in the Iliad, shows the prevalence
of similar notions among early Greeks, who
held, down to Æschylus’s day, that the importance
of a man among the dead was in proportion to the
circumstance with which his tomb was treated by
the living. It may, therefore, be assumed as certain
that these strongholds of the dead, if they were
such, were filled with many precious things in gold
and other metals, intended as parting gifts in honor
of the king who was laid to rest. Long after the
devastation of Mycenæ, I suppose that these tombs
<pb n='467'/><anchor id='Pg467'/>were opened in search of treasure, and not in vain;
and so nothing was said about the skeleton tenant,
while rumors went abroad of the rich treasure-trove
within the giant portal. Thus, then, the tradition
would spring up and grow, that the building was the
treasure-house of some old legendary king.
</p>

<p>
These antiquarian considerations have led us away
from the actual survey of the old vault, for ruin it
cannot be called. The simplicity and massiveness
of its structure have defied age and violence, and,
except for the shattered ornaments and a few pieces
over the inner side of the window, not a stone
appears ever to have been moved from its place.
Standing at the entrance, you look out upon the
scattered masonry of the walls of Mycenæ, on the
hillock over against you. Close beyond this is a
dark and solemn chain of mountains. The view is
narrow and confined, and faces the north, so that,
for most of the day, the gate is dark and in shadow.
We can conceive no fitter place for the burial of a
king, within sight of his citadel, in the heart of a
deep natural hillock, with a great solemn portal
symbolizing the resistless strength of the barrier
which he had passed into an unknown land. But
one more remark seems necessary. This treasure-house
is by no means a Hellenic building in its
features. It has the same perfection of construction
which can be seen at Eleutheræ, or any other Greek
fort, but still the really analogous buildings are to be
<pb n='468'/><anchor id='Pg468'/>found in far distant lands—in the raths of Ireland
and the barrows of the Crimea.
</p>

<p>
I have had the opportunity of comparing the
structure and effect of the great sepulchral monuments
in the county of Meath, in Ireland. Two of
these, Dowth and New Grange, are opened, and can
be entered almost as easily as the treasury of
Atreus. They lie close to the rich valley of the
Boyne, in that part of the country which was
pointed out by nature as the earliest seat of wealth
and culture. Dowth is the ruder and less ornamented,
and therefore not improbably the older, but
is less suited for the present comparison than the
greater and more ornate New Grange.
</p>

<p>
This splendid tomb is not a whit less remarkable,
or less colossal in its construction, than those at
Mycenæ, but differs in many details. It was not
hollowed out in a hillside, but was built of great
upright stones, with flat slabs laid over them, and
then covered with a mound of earth. An enormous
circle of giant boulders stands round the foot of the
mound. Instead of passing through a short entrance
into a great vaulted chamber, there is a long narrow
corridor, which leads to a much smaller, but still
very lofty room, nearly twenty feet high. Three
recesses in the walls of this latter each contain a
large round saucer, so to speak, made of single
stone, in which the remains of the dead seem to
have been laid. This saucer is very shallow, and
<pb n='469'/><anchor id='Pg469'/>not more than four feet in diameter. The great
stones with which the chamber and passage are constructed
are not hewn or shaped, and so far the
building is rather comparable with that of Tiryns
than that of Mycenæ. But all over the faces of the
stones are endless spiral and zigzag ornaments, even
covering built-in surfaces, and thus invisible, so that
this decoration must have been applied to the slabs
prior to the building. On the outside stones, both
under and above the entry, there is a well-executed
carving of more finished geometrical designs.
</p>

<p>
Putting aside minor details, it may be said that
while both monuments show an equal display of
human strength, and an equal contempt for human
toil, which were lavished upon them without stint,
the Greek building shows far greater finish of
design and neatness of execution, together with
greater simplicity. The stones are all carefully hewn
and fitted, but not carved or decorated. The triangular
carved block over the lintel, and the supposed
metal plates on the interior, were both foreign
to the original structure. On the contrary, while
the Irish tomb is a far greater feature in the landscape—a
landmark in the district—the great stones
within are not fitted together, or hewn into shape,
and yet they are covered with patterns and designs
strangely similar to the carvings found by Dodwell
and Dr. Schliemann at the Argive tombs. Thus the
Irish builders, with far greater rudeness, show a
<pb n='470'/><anchor id='Pg470'/>greater taste for ornament. They care less for
design and symmetry—more for beauty of detail.
The Greek essay naturally culminates in the severe
symmetry of the Doric Temple—the Irish in the
glorious intricacy of the illuminations of the <hi rend='italic'>Book of
Kells</hi>.
</p>

<p>
The second treasury lately excavated by Mrs.
Schliemann has been disappointing in its results.
Though it seems not to have been disturbed for
ages, it had evidently been once rifled, for nothing
save a few fragments of pottery were found within.
Its entrance is much loftier than that of the house
of Atreus, but the general building is inferior, the
stones are far smaller and by no means so well
fitted, and it produces altogether the impression of
being either a much earlier and ruder attempt, or a
poor and feeble imitation. Though Dr. Schliemann
asserts the former, I am disposed to suspect the
latter to be the case.
</p>

<p>
A great deal of what was said about the tomb of
Agamemnon, as the common people, with truer instinct,
call the supposed treasure-house, may be repeated
about the fortifications of Mycenæ. It is the
work of builders who know perfectly how to deal
with their materials—who can hew and fit great
blocks of stone with perfect ease; nay, who prefer,
for the sake of massive effect, to make their doorway
with such enormous blocks as even modern
science would find it difficult to handle. The
sculpt<pb n='471'/><anchor id='Pg471'/>ure over the gate fortunately remains almost entire.
The two lions, standing up at a small pillar, were
looking out fiercely at the stranger. The heads are
gone, having probably, as Dr. Schliemann first observed,
been made of bronze, and riveted to the
stone. The rest of the sculpture is intact, and is
of a strangely <anchor id="corr471"/><corr sic="haraldic">heraldic</corr> character. It is a piece of
bluish limestone,<note place="foot"><p>There has been strange diversity of opinion about the nature
of this stone. Dodwell and Leake call it basalt. Moreover, Dodwell
thought it greenish. Some one else thinks it yellowish. The
French expedition and Curtius call it limestone. Dr. Schliemann
says it is the same breccia as the rest of the gate. It is in the face
of these opinions that I persist in the statement that it is bluish,
and limestone.</p>
    <p>It is owing to this note that it was again critically examined by
Mr. Tuckett, who published his result in the <hi rend='italic'>Architect</hi> of 19th
January, 1879, and who had fragments of the stone analyzed,
which justified my observation. He also notes that several observers
erred as to the shape of the central pillar, which does not
diminish in bulk downward.</p></note> which must have been brought
from a long distance, quite different from the rough
breccia of the rest of the gate. The lintel-stone is
not nearly so vast as that of the treasure-house: it
is only fifteen feet long, but is somewhat thicker,
and also much deeper, going back the full depth of
the gateway. Still it must weigh a good many tons;
and it puzzles us to think how it can have been put
into its place with the appliances then in vogue.
The joint use of square and polygonal masonry is
very curious. Standing within the gate, one side is
<pb n='472'/><anchor id='Pg472'/>of square-hewn stones, the other of irregular, though
well-fitted, blocks. On the left side, looking into the
gate, there is a gap of one block in the wall, which
looks very like a window,<note place="foot">This, I perceive, is Dr. Schliemann’s opinion also. He was
the first to show that along the entrance-wall the fine building with
square blocks was only a facing laid on irregular building with
small stones. This points clearly to two successive stages in the
work.</note> as it is not probable that
a single stone was taken, or fell out of its place afterward,
without disturbing the rest. What makes it,
perhaps, more possible that this window is intentional,
is the position of the gate, which is not in
the middle of the walled causeway, as you enter,
but to the right side.
</p>

<p>
When you go in, and climb up the hill of the
Acropolis, you find various other portions of Cyclopean
walls which belonged to the old palace, in plan
very similar to that of Tiryns. But the outer wall
goes all round the hill where it is steepest, sometimes
right along a precipice, and everywhere offering an
almost insurmountable obstacle to an ancient assailant.
On the east side, facing the steep mountain,
which is separated from it by a deep gorge, is a
postern gate, consisting merely of three stones, but
these so massive, and so beautifully hewn and fitted,
as to be a structure hardly less striking than the
lion gate. At about half the depth of these huge
blocks there is a regular groove cut down both sides
and along the top, in order to hold the door.
</p>

<pb n='473'/><anchor id='Pg473'/>

<p>
The whole summit of the great rock is now stony
and bare, but not so bare that I could not gather
scarlet anemones, which found scanty sustenance
here and there in tiny patches of grass, and gladdened
the gray color of the native rock and the
primeval walls. The view from the summit, when
first I saw it, was one of singular solitude and peace;
not a stone seemed to have been disturbed for ages;
not a human creature, or even a browsing goat, was
visible, and the traveller might sketch or scrutinize
any part of the fortress without fear of intrusion, far
less of molestation. When I again reached the site,
in the spring of 1877, a great change had taken
place. Dr. Schliemann had attacked the ruins, and
had made his world-renowned excavations inside
and about the lion gate. To the gate itself this
was a very great gain. All the encumbering earth
and stones have been removed, so that we can now
admire the full proportions of the mighty portal.
He discovered a tiny porter’s lodge inside it. He
denied the existence of the wheel-tracks which we
and others fancied we had seen there on our former
visit.

</else></pgIf>
<p>
But proceeding from the gate to the lower side,
where the hill slopes down rapidly, and where the
great irregular Cyclopean wall trends away to the
right, Dr. Schliemann found a deep accumulation
of soil. This was, of course, the chief place on an
otherwise bare rock where excavations promised
<pb n='474'/><anchor id='Pg474'/>large results. And the result was beyond the wildest
anticipations. The whole account of what he
has done is long before the public in his very splendid
book, of which the illustrations are quite an
epoch in the history of ornament, and in spite of
their great antiquity will suggest to our modern
jewellers many an exquisite pattern. The sum of
what he found is this:—
</p>

<p>
He first found in this area a double circuit of thin
upright slabs, joined together closely, and joined
across the top with flat slabs mortised into them, the
whole circuit being like a covered way, about three
feet high. Into the enclosed circle a way leads
from the lion gate; and what I noted particularly
was this, that the whole circle, which was over
thirty yards in diameter, was separated from the
higher ground by a very miserable bounding wall,
which, though quite concealed before the excavations,
and therefore certainly very old, looked for
all the world like some Turkish piece of masonry.
</p>

<p>
As soon as this stone circle was discovered, it was
suggested that old Greek <hi rend='italic'>agoras</hi> were round, that
they were often in the citadel at the king’s gate, and
that people were sometimes buried in them. Dr.
Schliemann at once baptized the place as the agora
of Mycenæ. It was a circle with only one free
access, and that from the gate; it had tombstones
standing in the midst of it, and there were the
charred remains of sacrifices about them. The
<pb n='475'/><anchor id='Pg475'/>number of bodies already exhumed beneath preclude
their being all founders or heroes of the city.
These and other indications were enough to disprove
clearly that the circle was an agora, but that it was
rather a place of sepulture, enclosed, as such places
always were, with a fence, which seems made in
imitation of a palisade of wood.
</p>

<p>
Inside this circuit of stone slabs were found—apparently
at the same depth, but on this Dr.
Schliemann is not explicit—very curious and very
archaic carved slabs, with rude hunting scenes of
warriors in very uncomfortable chariots, and varied
spiral ornaments filling up the vacant spaces. These
sculptures are unlike any Hellenic work, properly
so called, and point back to a very remote period,
and probably to the introduction of a foreign art
among the rude inhabitants of early Greece.
Deeper down were found more tombstones, all
manner of archaic pottery, arrow-heads, and buttons
of bone; there was also found some rude construction
of hewn stones, which may have served as
an altar or a tomb.
</p>

<p>
Yet further down, twenty-one feet deep, and close
to the rock, were lying together a number of skeletons,
which seemed to have been hastily or carelessly
buried; but in the rock itself, in rudely hewn
chambers, were found fifteen bodies buried with a
splendor seldom equalled in the history of the world.
These people were not buried like Greeks. They
<pb n='476'/><anchor id='Pg476'/>were not laid in rock chambers, like the Scythian
kings. They were sunk in graves under the earth,
which were large enough to receive them, had they
not been filled up round the bottom with rudely-built
walls, or pieces of stone, so as to reduce the area,
but to create perhaps some ventilation for the fire
which had partly burnt the bodies where they were
found. Thus the splendidly-attired and jewelled
corpses, some of them with masks and breastplates
of gold, were, so to speak, jammed down by the
earth and stones above them into a very narrow
space; but there appears to have been some arrangement
for protecting them and their treasure from
complete confusion with the soil which settled down
over them. This, if the account of the excavation
be accurate, seems the most peculiar feature in the
burial of these great personages, but finds a parallel
in the curious tombs of Hallstadt, which afford many
analogies to Mycenæ.<note place="foot">These analogies are brought out by Mr. A. S. Murray, in the
<hi rend='italic'>Academy</hi>, No. 29. Cf. also Dörpfeld in <hi rend='italic'>Schuchhardt</hi>, p. 161.</note>
</p>

<p>
Dr. Schliemann boldly announced in the <hi rend='italic'>Times</hi>,
and the public believed him, that he had found Agamemnon,
and his companions, who were murdered
when they returned from the siege of Troy. The
burial is indeed quite different from any such ceremony
described in the Homeric poems. The number
of fifteen is not to be accounted for by any of
the legends. There is no reason to think all the
<pb n='477'/><anchor id='Pg477'/>tombs have been discovered; one, or at least part
of the treasure belonging to it, was since found outside
the circle. Another was afterward found by
M. Stamatakes. Æschylus, our oldest and best
authority, places the tomb of Agamemnon, not at
Mycenæ, but at Argos. They all agree that he was
buried with contempt and dishonor. The result was,
that when the public came to hear the Agamemnon
theory disproved, it was disposed to take another
leap in the dark, and to look upon the whole discovery
as suspicious, and as possibly something
mediæval.
</p>

<p>
Such an inference would be as absurd as to accept
the hypothesis of Dr. Schliemann. The tombs are
undoubtedly very ancient, certainly far more ancient
than the supposed date of Homer, or even of Agamemnon.
The treasures which have been carried
to Athens, and which I saw and handled at
the National Bank, are not only really valuable
masses of gold, but have a good deal of beauty
of workmanship, both in design and decoration.
Though the masks are very ugly and barbarous,
and though there is in general no power shown of
moulding any animal figure, there are very beautiful
cups and jugs, there are most elegant geometrical
ornaments—zigzags, spirals, and the like—and there
are even imitations of animals of much artistic
merit. The celebrated silver bull’s head, with golden
horns, is a piece of work which would not disgrace
<pb n='478'/><anchor id='Pg478'/>a goldsmith of our day; and this may be said of
many of the ornaments. Any one who knows the
Irish gold ornaments in the Academy Museum in
Dublin perceives a wonderful family likeness in the
old Irish spirals and decorations, yet not more than
might occur among two separate nations working
with the same materials under similar conditions.
But I feel convinced that the best things in the tombs
at Mycenæ were not made by native artists, but imported,
probably from Syria and Egypt. This seems
proved even by the various materials which have
been employed—ivory, alabaster, amber; in one
case even an ostrich egg. So we shall, perhaps, in
the end come back upon the despised legends of
Cadmus and Danaus, and find that they told us truly
of an old cultured race coming from the South and
the East to humanize the barbarous progenitors of
the Greeks.
</p>

<p>
I can now add important corroborations of these
general conclusions from the researches made since
the appearance of my earlier editions. I then said
that the discoveries were too fresh and dazzling to
admit of safe theories concerning their origin. By
way of illustration I need only allude to those <hi rend='italic'>savants</hi>
(they will hereafter be obliged to me for omitting
their names) who imagined that all the Mycenæan
tombs were not archaic at all, but the work of
northern barbarians who occupied Greece during the
disasters of the later Roman Empire! Serious
re<pb n='479'/><anchor id='Pg479'/>searches, however, have at last brought us considerable
light. In the first place Helbig, in an important
work comparing the treasures of Mycenæ with the
allusions to art, arms, and manufactures in the Homeric
poems, came to the negative conclusion that
these two civilizations were distinct—that the Homeric
poets cannot have had before them the palace
of Mycenæ which owned the Schliemann treasures.
As there is no room in Greek history for such a
civilization posterior to the Homeric poems, it follows
that the latter must describe a civilization considerably
later than that we have found at Mycenæ.
Placing the Homeric poems in the eighth century
<hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi> we shall be led to about 1000 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi> as the latest
possible date for the splendors of Mycenæ. But
this negative conclusion has been well-nigh demonstrated
by the positive results of the various recent
researches in Egypt. Not only has the Egypt Exploration
Society examined carefully the sites of
Naucratis and Daphne, thus disclosing to us what
Greek art and manufacture could produce in the
sixth and seventh centuries <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi> (665–565 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>),
but Mr. Flinders Petrie has enriched our knowledge
by his wonderful discoveries of Egyptian art on
several sites, and of many epochs, fairly determinable
by the reigning dynasties. He has recently
(1890) examined the Mycenæan and other pre-historic
treasures collected at Athens, by the light of
his rich Egyptian experience, and has given a
sum<pb n='480'/><anchor id='Pg480'/>mary of the results in two short articles in the
<hi rend='italic'>Journal of Hellenic Studies</hi>.
</p>

<p>
He finds that the materials and their treatment,
such as blue glass, even in its decomposition, alabaster,
rock-crystal, hollowed and painted within,
dome-head rivets attaching handles of gold cups,
ostrich eggs with handles attached, ties made for
ornament in porcelain, are all to be found in Egyptian
tombs varying from 1400 to 1100 in date. His
analysis leads him to give the dates for the tombs
I.-IV. at Mycenæ as 1200–1100 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi> That an
earlier date is improbable is shown by the negative
evidence that none of the purely geometrical false-necked
vases occur, such as are the general product
of 1400–1200 in Egyptian deposits. But as several
isolated articles are of older types, as in particular
the lions over the gate are quite similar to a gilt
wooden lion he found of about 1450 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi> in date,
the Mycenæan civilization probably extended over a
considerable period. He even finds proof of decadence
in grave IV. as compared with the rest, and
so comes to the conclusion, which I am disposed to
question, that the tombs within the circle at Mycenæ
(shaft-tombs) are later and worse interments made
by the same people who had already built the more
majestic and costly bee-hive tombs. Instead therefore
of upholding a Phrygian origin, Mr. Petrie
asserts an Egyptian origin for both Mycenæan and
parallel Phrygian designs. The spiral pattern in its
<pb n='481'/><anchor id='Pg481'/>various forms, the rosettes, the keyfret, the palmetto,
are all used in very early Egyptian decoration.
The inlaid daggers of Mycenæ have long been recognized
as inspired by Egypt; <anchor id="corr481"/><corr sic="(quote)">but</corr> we must note
that it is native work and not merely an imported
article. The attitude of the figures and of the lions,
and the form of the cat, are such as no Egyptian
would have executed. To make such things in
Greece implies a far higher culture than merely to
import them. The same remark applies to the
glazed pottery; the style of some is not Egyptian,
so that here the Mycenæans were capable of elaborate
technical work, and imitated, rather than
imported from Egypt.... The familiarity with
Egypt is further proved by the lotus pattern on the
dagger-blade, by the cat on the dagger, and the cats
on the gold foil ornaments, since the cat was then
unknown in Greece. That the general range of the
civilization was that of Africa, is indicated by the
frequent use of the palm (not then known in Greece)
as a decoration, and by the very scanty clothing of
the male figures, indicating that dress was not a
necessity of climate. On the other hand this culture
reached out to the north of Europe. The silver-headed
reindeer or elk, found in grave IV., can only
be the result of northern intercourse. The amber
so commonly used comes from the Baltic. And we
see in Celtic ornament the obvious reproduction of
the decorations of Mycenæ, as Mr. Arthur Evans
<pb n='482'/><anchor id='Pg482'/>has shown. Not only is the spiral decoration indistinguishable,<note place="foot">This is not true of Irish designs, which I compared carefully
with the Mycenæan, and failed to find any identity, though many
close resemblances.</note>
but also the taste for elaborately embossed
diadems and breastplates of gold is peculiar
to the Mycenæan and Celtic cultures. The great
period of Mycenæ seems therefore to date 1300–1100
<hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>, with occasional traditional links with
Egypt as far back as 1500 or 1600 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>
</p>

<p>
Such is an abstract of Mr. Petrie’s estimate.<note place="foot">It agrees with that of Schuchhardt (in <hi rend='italic'>Schliemann’s Excavations</hi>,
1891), and of Busolt in the new edition of his Greek history,
1892.</note>
</p>

<p>
I will only here point out, in addition, the remarkable
unity of style between the ornaments
found at a depth of twenty-five feet in the tombs,
the sculptured tombstones twelve or fourteen feet
over them, and the lions on the gate of the citadel.
It is, indeed, only a general uniformity, but it corroborates
Mr. Petrie’s inference that there was more
than mere importing; there was home manufacture.
But still among the small gold ornaments in the
tombs were found several pairs of animals placed
opposite each other in this strictly <hi rend='italic'>heraldic</hi> fashion,
and even on the engraved gems this symmetry is
curiously frequent. It seems, then, that the art of
Mycenæ had not changed when its early history
came to a close, and its inhabitants were forced to
<pb n='483'/><anchor id='Pg483'/>abandon the fortress and submit to the now Doric
Argos.
</p>

<p>
We are, indeed, told expressly by Pausanias and
Diodorus that this event did not take place till after
the Persian wars, when old Hellenic art was already
well defined, and was beginning to make rapid progress.
But this express statement, which I saw
reason to question since my former remarks on the
subject in this book, I am now determined to reject,
in the face of the inconsistencies of these historians,
the silence of all the contemporaries of the alleged
conquest, and the exclusively archaic remains which
Dr. Schliemann has unearthed. Mycenæ, along
with Tiryns, Midea, and the other towns of the
plain, was incorporated into Argos at a far earlier
date, and not posterior to the brilliant rule of Pheidon.
So it comes that historical Greece is silent
about the ancient capital of the Pelopids, and the
poets transfer all its glories to Argos. Once, indeed,
the name did appear on the national records. The
offerings to the gods at Olympia, and at Delphi,
after the victory over the Persians, recorded that a
few patriots—460 in all—from Mycenæ and from
Tiryns had joined the Greeks at Platæa, while the
remainder of the Argives preserved a base and cowardly
neutrality. The Mycenæans were very few in
number; sixty are mentioned in connection with
Thermopylæ by Herodotus. They were probably
exiles through Greece, who had preserved their
<pb n='484'/><anchor id='Pg484'/>traditions and their descent, and gloried in exposing
and insulting Argive Medism. The Tirynthian 400
may even have been the remnant of the slave population,
which Herodotus tells us seized the citadel
of Tiryns, when driven out from Argos twenty
years before, and who lived there for some years.
In the crisis of Platæa the Greeks were not dainty
or critical, and they may have readily conceded the
title of Tirynthian to these doubtful citizens, out of
hatred and disgust at the neutrality of Argos. However
these things may be, the mention of Mycenæans
and Tirynthians on this solitary occasion
afforded an obvious warrant to Diodorus for his
date of the destruction of Mycenæ. But I am
convinced that his authority, and that of Pausanias,
who follows him, must be deliberately rejected.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the origin of Mycenæ, and its
greatness as a royal residence, must be thrown back
into a far deeper antiquity than any one had yet
imagined. If Agamemnon and his house represent
Hellenic princes, of the type of Homer’s knowledge
and acquaintance, they must have arisen after some
older, and apparently different dynasties had ruled
and had buried their dead at Mycenæ.<note place="foot">This theory of mine, stated in my first edition, is strongly
supported by Dr. Adler in his preface to Schliemann’s <hi rend='italic'>Tiryns</hi>
(1885).</note> But it is
also possible that the Homeric bards, describing
professedly the acts of a past age, imposed their
<pb n='485'/><anchor id='Pg485'/>new manners, and their own culture, upon the
Pelopids, whom they only knew by vague tradition,
and that thus their drawing is false; while the
chiefs they glorify were the ancient pre-Hellenic
rulers of the country. This latter supposition is so
shocking a heresy against <q>Homer</q> that I will not
venture to expand it, and will leave the reader to
add any conjectures he chooses to those which I have
already hazarded in too great number.
</p>

<p>
When the splendid findings of Dr. Schliemann
are taken out of their bandboxes in the Bank of
Athens, and arranged in the National Museum;<note place="foot">This has all been done, and alas! many of the gold cups have
been polished by the barbarous zeal of the curators, so destroying
the exquisite red bloom which made them so remarkable.</note>
when the diligence of Greek archæologists investigates
thoroughly the remainder of the site at Mycenæ,
which is not nearly exhausted; when new
accidents (such as the discoveries at Sparta and
Vaphio) and new researches enlarge these treasures
perhaps a thousand-fold, there will be formed at
Athens a museum of pre-historic art which will not
have its equal in the world (except at Cairo), and
which will introduce us to an epoch of culture which
we hardly yet suspected, when writing and coinage
were unknown, when the Greeks had not reached
unto their name, or possibly their language, but
when, nevertheless, considerable commerce existed,
when wonderful skill had already been attained in
<pb n='486'/><anchor id='Pg486'/>arts and manufactures, and when men had even
accumulated considerable wealth and splendor in
well-established centres of power.
</p>

<p>
The further investigation of the remains of Mycenæ,
with the additional evidence derived from the
ruins of Tiryns, presently to be described, have led
Dr. Adler to explain Mycenæ as the record of a
double foundation, first by a race who built rubble
masonry, and buried their dead in narrow rock-tombs
or graves, piling on the bodies their arms and
ornaments; secondly, after some considerable interval,
by a race who built splendid ashlar masonry,
with well-cut blocks, and who constructed great
beehive tombs, where the dead could lie with ample
room in royal state. The second race enlarged,
rebuilt, and refaced the old fortifications, added the
present lion gate, and built the so-called treasure-houses.
For convenience’ sake he calls them, according
to the old legends, Perseids and Pelopids
respectively. Hence the tombs which Dr. Schliemann
found were really far older than any one had
at first supposed, and if the record of Homer points
distinctly to the Pelopids, then the gold and jewels
of a far earlier people were hidden deep underground
in the foundation of Agamemnon’s fortress,
merely marked by a sacred circle of stones and some
archaic gravestones.
</p>

<p>
To which of these stages of building do the ruins
of Tiryns belong? Apparently to the earlier, though
<pb n='487'/><anchor id='Pg487'/>here, again, the size of the stones used is far greater
than those in the first Mycenæ, and it is now certain
that the beginnings of artificial shaping are discernible
in them. Since the second edition of this book
the walls have been uncovered and examined by
Dr. Schliemann, with the valuable advice and assistance
of Dr. Dörpfeld, so that I may conclude this
chapter with a brief summary of the results they
have attained.
</p>

<p>
The upper part of the rock of Tiryns, which consisted
of two plateaus or levels, was known to contain
remains of building by the shafts which Dr.
Schliemann had already sunk there in former years.
But now a very different method of excavating was
adopted—that of uncovering the surface in layers,
so that successive strata of debris might be clearly
distinguished. This exceedingly slow and laborious
process, which I saw going on for days at Tiryns
with very little result, brought out in the end the
whole plan of a palace, with its gates, floors, parting
walls, and pillar bases, so that in the admirable
drawing to be seen in the book called <hi rend='italic'>Tiryns</hi>, Dr.
Dörpfeld has given us the first clear view of an old
Greek, or perhaps even pre-Hellenic, palace. The
partial agreement with the plan of the palaces of
Troy, and of Mycenæ, since discovered, and the
adoption in Hellenic temples of the plan of entrance,
here several times repeated—two pillars between
<pb n='488'/><anchor id='Pg488'/>antæ—show that the palace at Tiryns was not exceptional,
but typical.
</p>

<p>
All the gates leading up into this palace are still
distinctly marked by the threshold or door-sill, a
great stone, lying in its place, with grooves inserted
for the pivots of the doors, which were of wood, but
had their pivots shod with bronze, as was proved by
the actual remains. These doors divided a double
porch, entered either way between two pillars of
wood, standing upon stone bases still in their place,
and flanked by antæ, which were below of stone
and above of wood dowelled into the stone piers.
All the upper structure of the gates, and, indeed, of
all the palace, seems to have been of wood. There
are clear signs of a great conflagration, in which
the palace perished. This implies the existence
of ample fuel, and while the ashes, mud-bricks, etc.,
remain, no trace of architrave, or pillar, or roof has
been found. There are gates of similar design leading
into the courts and principal chamber of the
palace, the floors of which are covered with a careful
lime concrete marked with line patterns, and so
sloped as to afford easy drainage into a vent leading
to pipes of terra cotta, which carried off water. The
same careful arrangements are observed in the bath-room,
with a floor of one great stone, twelve feet by
nine, which is likewise pierced to carry off water.
The remains of a terra cotta tub were found there,
and the walls of the room were panelled with wood,
<pb n='489'/><anchor id='Pg489'/>set into the raised edge of the floor-stone by dowels
sunk in the stone. No recent discovery is more
interesting than this.
</p>

<p>
Of the walls little remains but the foundations,
and here and there a couple of feet of mud-bricks,
with signs of beams let into them, which added to
the conflagration. But enough remains to show
that the walls of the better rooms were richly covered
with ornament. There is a fresco of a bull
still preserved, and reproduced in Dr. Schliemann’s
book; and there was also found a very remarkable
frieze ornament in rosettes and brooch patterns,
made of blue glass paste (supposed to be Homer’s
<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">κύανος</foreign>) and alabaster. This valuable relic shows
remarkable analogies in design to other prehistoric
ornaments found in Greece.
</p>

<p>
The size of the main hall, or men’s apartment, is
very large, the floor covering about 120 square
yards, and the parallel room in the palace at Troy
was consequently taken to be the cella of a temple.
But there seems no doubt that the great room at
Tiryns, with a hearth in the middle and four pillar
bases near it, supporting, perhaps, a higher roof,
with a clerestory, was the main reception room of
the palace; a smaller room of similar construction,
not connected with the former, save by a circuitous
route through passages, seems to have been the
ladies’ drawing-room.
</p>

<pb n='490'/><anchor id='Pg490'/>

<p>
If I were to attempt any full description of this
wonderful place I should be obliged to copy out a
great part of the fifth chapter in Dr. Schliemann’s
book, in which Dr. Dörpfeld has set down very
modestly, but very completely, the results of his
own acuteness and research. Many things which
are now plain enough were perfect riddles till he
found the true solution, and the acuteness with
which he has utilized the smallest hints, as well
as the caution of his conclusions, make this work
of his a very model of scientific induction.
</p>

<p>
He says, rightly enough, that a minute description
is necessary, because a very few years will cover up
much of the evidence which he had plainly before
him. The concrete floors, the remains of mud-brick
walls, the plan of the various rooms, will be choked
up with grass and weeds, unless they are kept
covered and cleared. The rain, which has long
since washed all traces of mortar out of the walls,
will wash away far more now that the site is opened,
and so the future archæologist will find that the book
<hi rend='italic'>Tiryns</hi> will tell him much that the actual Tiryns cannot
show him.
</p>

<p>
The lower platform on the rock is not yet touched,
and here perhaps digging will discover to us the
remains of a temple, from which one very archaic
Doric capital and an antefix have found their way to
the higher rock. There are traces, too, of the great
<pb n='491'/><anchor id='Pg491'/>fort being the second building on the site, over an
older and not yet clearly determined palace.
</p>

<p>
Two things are plain from these discoveries, and
I dwell on them with satisfaction, because they corroborate
old opinions of mine, put forth long before
the principal evidence was forthcoming. First, the
general use of wood for pillars and architraves, so
showing how naturally the stone temple imitated the
older wooden buildings. Secondly, the archaic or
ante-Hellenic character of all that was found at
Tiryns, with the solitary exception of the architectural
fragments, which certainly have no building
to correspond to them where they were found.
Thus my hypothesis, which holds that Tiryns, as
well as Mycenæ, was destroyed at least as early as
Pheidon’s time (660 <hi rend='small'>B. C.</hi>), and not after the Persian
wars, receives corroboration which will amount to
positive proof in any mind open to evidence on the
point.

<head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>

<head type="sub">MEDIÆVAL GREECE.</head>

<p>
When I first went to Greece, nearly twenty years
ago, the few travellers one met in the country never
thought of studying its mediæval remains. We
were in search of classical art, we passed by Byzantine
churches or Frankish towers with contemptuous
ignorance. Mr. Finlay’s great book, indeed, was
already written; but those who knew German and
were bold enough to attack the eight volumes which
Ersch and Gruber’s <hi rend='italic'>Encyclopædia</hi> devote to the
article on Greece, had been taught by Hopf’s <hi rend='italic'>Essay
on Mediæval Greece</hi> to fathom what depths dulness
could attain. Whether the author, or the odious
paper, and type in its double columns, contributed
to this result, was of little consequence. The subject
itself seemed dreary beyond description. All
the various peoples who invaded, swayed, ravaged,
colonized the country in the Dark Ages, seemed
but undistinguishable hordes of barbarians, of
whom we knew nothing, about whom we cared
nothing, beyond a general hatred of them, as those
who had broken up and destroyed the splendid
temples and fair statues that are now the world’s
desire. Even the very thorough and learned
<pb n='493'/><anchor id='Pg493'/>scholars, who produced <hi rend='italic'>Bædeker’s Greece</hi>, a very
few years ago, never thought of putting in any
information whatever, beyond their chronological
table, upon the many centuries which intervened
between the close of paganism and the recent regeneration
of the country. The contempt for Byzantine
work in the East was in our early days like
the contempt of Renaissance work in the West.
We were all Classical or Gothic in taste.
</p>

<p>
Now a great reaction is setting in. Instead of the
dreadful Hopf, we have the fascinating Gregorovius,
whose <hi rend='italic'>Mediæval Athens</hi> clothes even dry details with
the hue of fancy; the sober <hi rend='italic'>Murray’s Guide</hi> includes
Mt. Athos and its wonders as part of its task.
Recent travellers, and the students at the Foreign
Schools of Athens, tell us of curious churches and
their frescoes, and now Mr. Schultz, of the British
school, has undertaken to reproduce them with his
pencil. Following the example of Pullen, whose
pictures have secured for posterity some record of
the churches of Salonica, so often threatened by fire,
he will perpetuate the remnants of an architecture
and an art which were rapidly perishing from
neglect. When I was first at Athens men were
seriously discussing the propriety of razing to the
ground the most striking of all the Byzantine
churches at Athens, because it stood in the thoroughfare
which led from the palace to the railway
station! Historians tell us the dreadful fact, that
<pb n='494'/><anchor id='Pg494'/>over seventy of these delicately quaint buildings
were destroyed when the new cathedral, a vulgar
and senseless compromise in style, was constructed.
A few more years of Vandalism in Greece, a few
more terrible fires at Salonica and at Athos, and the
world had lost its best records of a very curious and
distinctive civilization.
</p>

<p>
There are indeed no mean traces of this art in
Adriatic Italy; the exarchate at Ravenna, the eastern
traffic of Venice, have shown their influence on
Italian art and architecture. The splendid mosaics
of Ravenna, nay, even the seven domes of S.
Antonio at Verona, the frescoes of the Giotto
Chapel at Padua, above all, the great cathedral at
Venice, are all strongly colored—those of Ravenna
even produced—by Byzantine art. Yet most travellers
who visit S. Mark’s at Venice have never seen
a Byzantine church, and do not feel its Eastern
parentage; still fewer visit the splendid basilica of
Parenzo, which is a still more unmistakable example.
But to those who have turned aside from
Olympia and Parthenon to study the early Christian
remains in Greece, all this art of Eastern Italy will
acquire a new interest and a deeper meaning.
</p>

<p>
These are the reasons which have tempted me to
say a few words on this side of Greek travel. I do
not pretend to speak as an authority; I only desire
to stimulate a nascent interest which will presently
make what I say seem simple and antiquated. But
<pb n='495'/><anchor id='Pg495'/>as yet even high authorities are very much in the
dark about these things. What would a student of
Gothic architecture say to a discussion whether an
extant building belonged to the fourth century or
the eleventh? and yet such divergent views are still
maintained concerning the origin of the Athenian
churches.
</p>

<p>
Let us begin with the best and quaintest, the so-called
<hi rend='italic'>Old Cathedral</hi>, which was fortunately allowed to
stand beside its ugly and pretentious successor. The
first thing which strikes us is the exceeding smallness
of the dimensions, it is like one of the little chapels
you find in Glendalough and elsewhere in Ireland.
I do not know whether the Greeks contemplated a
congregation kneeling in the open air, as was the
case around these chapels in Ireland, but such edifices
were certainly intended in the first instance as
holy places for sacerdotal celebrations, not as houses
of prayer for the people. I was told on Mt. Athos
that it was not the practice of the Greek church to
celebrate more than one service in any one Church
daily. Hence the monks, who are making prayer
continually, have twenty or thirty chapels within
the precincts of each monastery. Perhaps a similar
motive may have led to the construction of a great
number of smaller churches at Athens, where
seventy have already been destroyed, and at
Salonica, where remains of them are still being
frequently discovered. Perhaps, also, that desire
<pb n='496'/><anchor id='Pg496'/>to consecrate to the religion of Christ the hallowed
places of the heathen, which turned the Parthenon
and the temple of Theseus into churches, also
prompted the Byzantine bishops to set up chapels
upon smaller heathen sanctuaries, where no stately
temple existed, and mere consecration would have
left no patent symbol of Christian occupation.
</p>

<p>
But if this Cathedral is small, it has the proper
beauty of minute art; it is covered with rich
decoration. All its surfaces show carved fragments
not only of classical, but of earlier Byzantine work—friezes,
reliefs, inscriptions, capitals—all so disposed
with a general correspondence or symmetry
as to produce the effect of a real design. Moreover,
this foreign ornament is set in a building strictly
Byzantine in form, with its rich doorway, its tiny
windows with their high semicircular arches supported
on delicate capitals, and toned by the centuries of
Attic dust to that rich gold brown which has turned
the Parthenon from marble almost to ruddy gold.
Never was there greater harmony and unity attained
by the most deliberate patch-work. In the earlier
works on Byzantine art, this church was confidently
assigned to the sixth century. Buchon found upon
it the arms of La Roche and of Villehardouin, so
that he assigned it to the thirteenth. The character
of the other buildings of these knights makes me
doubt that they and their friends could have constructed
such a church—the Western monks then
<pb n='497'/><anchor id='Pg497'/>built Latin churches in Greece—and I suppose that
the arms, which I could not find, were only carved
by the Franks upon the existing building. But I will
not therefore subscribe to the sixth-century theory.
</p>

<p>
Of the remaining churches three only, the Kapnikarea,
the Virgin of the Monastery, and S. Theodore,
are worth studying, as specimens of the typical
form of such buildings. The main plan is a square,
surmounted by a cupola supported on four pillars,
with a corridor or porch on the West side, and three
polygonal apses on the East. Lesser cupolas often
surround the central dome. The height and slenderness
of this central dome is probably the clearest
sign of comparative lateness in these buildings,
which used to be attributed to the fourth and fifth
centuries, but are now degraded to the eleventh.
The earliest form is no doubt that of the massive
S. George’s at Salonica—a huge Rotunda covered
with a flat dome, not unlike the Pantheon at Rome,
with nothing but richly ornamented niches, and a
splendid mosaic ceiling in the dome, to give relief to
a very plain design. The successive complications
and refinements added to this simple structure may
be studied even in the later churches of Salonica.
</p>

<p>
The traveller who has whetted his taste for this
peculiar form of mediæval art, and desires to study
it further, will find within reach of Athens two
monasteries well worth a visit, that of the Phæneromené
on Salamis, a very fair specimen of an
un<pb n='498'/><anchor id='Pg498'/>disturbed Greek monastery, and that of Daphne,
which may be ranked with the ruins of Mistra as
showing clear traces of the conflict of East and
West, of Latin with Greek Christianity. This
sanctuary, with its now decaying walls, succeeded
as usual to a pagan shrine with hardly altered name.
The Saints, still pictured in black and gold upon the
walls, and worshipped upon their festivals, have
become fantastic and unreal beings, well enough
adapted to that mixture of superstition and nationalism
which is the body of the Greek religion, and,
despite a purer creed, not very far removed from the
religious instincts of the old Hellenic race. Five
or six wretched monks still occupy the dilapidated
building, vegetating in sleepy idleness; they do
nothing but repeat daily their accustomed prayers,
and receive dues for allowing the people of the
neighboring hamlets to kiss, once or twice a year,
a dreadful-looking S. Elias, painted olive-brown on a
gold background, or to light the nightly lamp at the
wayside shrine of a saint black with smoke.
</p>

<p>
The structure as we now see it is chiefly the work
of the Cistercians who accompanied Otho de la
Roche from Champagne to his dukedom of Athens,
and was established round a far older Byzantine
church and monastery. Like all mediæval convents,
it is fortified, and the whole settlement, courts
and gardens included, is surrounded by a crenelated
wall, originally about thirty feet high.
</p>

<pb n='499'/><anchor id='Pg499'/>

<p>
There are occasional towers in the wall, and
remains of arches supporting a passage of sufficient
altitude for the defenders to look over the battlements.
The old church in the centre of the court
has had a narthex or nave added in Gothic style by
the Benedictines, and here again are battlements,
from which the monks could send down stones or
boiling liquid upon assailants who penetrated the
outer walls. Three sides of the court are surrounded
by buildings; beneath, there are massive arcades of
stone for the kitchen, store-rooms, and refectory;
above, wooden galleries which supplied the monks
with their cells. Most of this is now in ruins, occupied
in part by peasants and their sheep. But the
church, both in its external simplicity and its internal
grandeur, is remarkable for the splendid decoration
of its walls with mosaics, which, alas! have
been allowed to decay as much from the indolence
of the Greeks as the intolerance of the Turks. In
fact, while some care and regard for classical remains
have gradually been instilled into the minds
of the inhabitants—of course, money value is an
easily understood test—the respect for their splendid
mediæval remains has only gained Western
intellects within the last two or three years, so that
we may expect another generation to elapse before
this new kind of interest will be disseminated among
the possessors of so great a bequest from the Middle
Ages.
</p>

<pb n='500'/><anchor id='Pg500'/>

<p>
The interior of the church at Daphne is a melancholy
example. From the effects of damp the
mortar has loosened, and great patches of the precious
mosaic have fallen to the ground. You can
pick up handfulls of glazed and gilded fragments, of
which the rich surfaces were composed. Here and
there a Turkish bullet has defaced a solemn Saint,
while the fires lit by soldiers in days of war, and
by shepherds in time of peace, have, in many places,
blackened the roof beyond recognition. Within the
central cupola a gigantic head of Christ on gold
ground is still visible, or was so when I saw the
place in 1889; but the whole roof was in danger
of falling, and the Greek Government, at the instigation
of Dr. Dörpfeld, had undertaken to stay
the progress of decay, and so the building was filled
with scaffolding. This, however, enabled us to
mount close to the figures, which in the short and
high building are seen with difficulty from the
ground, and so we distinguished clearly round the
base of the cupola the twelve Apostles, in the bay
arches the prophets, in the transepts the Annunciation,
the Nativity, the Baptism, and the Transfiguration
of Christ—all according to the strict models
laid down for such ornaments by the Greek Church.
The drawings are indeed stiff and grotesque, but the
gloom and mystery of the building hide all imperfections,
and give to these imposing figures in black
and gold a certain majesty, which must have been
<pb n='501'/><anchor id='Pg501'/>felt tenfold by simple worshippers not trained in
habits of æsthetic criticism.
</p>

<p>
We have, unfortunately, no records of the history
of these convents, as in the case of many Western
abbeys, and the old chronicles of wars and pestilences
seldom mention this quiet life. We should
fain, says M. Henri Belle, have followed the fortunes
of these monks who left some fair abbey in
Burgundy to catechise schismatics in this distant
land, and bring their preaching to aid the sword of
the Crusaders; but these Crusaders were generally
intent on changing their cross for a crown, and were
therefore not at all likely to favor the rigid proselytism
of the Cistercians. It is very interesting to
know that Innocent III., that great pope, who from
the outset disapproved of the violent overthrow of
the Christian Empire of the East, was the first to
recommend, both to the conquerors and their clergy,
such moderation as might serve to bring back the
schismatic Greeks to the Roman fold. There are
still extant several of his letters to the abbeys of
the Morea, and to this abbey of the duchy of Athens,
showing that even his authority and zeal in this
matter were unable to restrain the bigotry of the
Latin monks. There were frequent quarrels, too,
between these monks of Daphne and their Duke,
and frequent appeals to the sovran pontiff to regulate
the relations between the civil authority, which
claimed the right of suzerain, and the religious
<pb n='502'/><anchor id='Pg502'/>orders, which claimed absolute independence and
immunity from all feudal obligations. Still, in spite
of all disputes, the abbey was the last resting-place
of the Frankish Dukes of Athens, and in a vault
beneath the narthex were found several of their
rude stone coffins, without inscription or ornament.
One only has carved upon it the arms of the second
Guy de la Roche, third Duke of Athens—two entwined
serpents surmounted with two fleurs-de-lis.
Guy II., says the chronicle, behaved as a gallant
lord, beloved of all, and attained great renown in
every kingdom. He sleeps here, not in the darkness
of oblivion, but obscured by greater monuments
of the greater dead. Yet I cannot but dally over
this interesting piece of mediæval history, the more
so as it explains the strange title of Theseus, Duke
of Athens, in Shakespeare’s immortal <hi rend='italic'>Midsummer
Night’s Dream</hi>, as well as the curious fact, at least
to classical readers, that the poet should have chosen
mediæval Athens as a court of gracious manners,
and suitable for the background of his fairy drama.
</p>

<p>
Neglecting geography, I shall carry the reader
next to the very analogous ruins of Mistra, where,
however, it was rather the Greek that supplanted
the Latin, than the Latin the Greek ecclesiastic.
</p>

<p>
When the Franks invaded Greece a very remarkable
family, the Villehardouins, seized a part of the
Morea, and presently built Mistra, above Sparta; it
was adorned with fair Gothic churches and palaces,
<pb n='503'/><anchor id='Pg503'/>and surmounted by a fortress. Sixty years after
the conquest, William Villehardouin was captured
by a new Byzantine emperor Palæologus, who was
recovering his dominion. The Frank was obliged
to cede for his ransom the forts of Mistra and
Monemvasia, which from that time were strongholds
of the Byzantine power till the conquest of the
Turks. Still the Villehardouins long kept hold of
Kalamata and other forts; and to the pen of one of
the family, Geoffrey, we owe the famous old chronicle
<hi rend='italic'>La Conquête de Constantinople</hi>, which is unique
in its importance both as a specimen of old French
and a piece of mediæval history.
</p>

<p>
The architecture of Mistra, begun at a noble epoch
by the Latins, was taken up by the Byzantine
Greeks, so that we have both styles combined in
curious relics of the now deserted stronghold. For,
since 1850, when an earthquake shook down many
houses, the population wandered to the revived
Sparta, which is now a thriving town. But as the
old Sparta in its greatest days was only a collection
of shabby villages, showing no outward sign of its
importance, so the new and vulgar Sparta has no
attractions (save the lovely orange and lemon
orchards round it) in comparison with the mediæval
Mistra. The houses are piled one above another till
you reach the summit crowned by the citadel which,
itself a mountain, is severed from the higher mountains
at its back by a deep gorge with a tumbling
<pb n='504'/><anchor id='Pg504'/>river. <q>The whole town is now nothing but ruined
palaces, churches, and houses. You wander up
rudely-paved streets rising zigzag, and pass beneath
arches on which are carved the escutcheons of
French knights. You enter courts overgrown with
grass, but full of memories of the Crusaders. It is
the very home of the Middle Ages. Passing through
these streets, now the resort of lizards and serpents,
you come upon Frankish tombs, among others that
of Theodora Tocco, wife of the Emperor Constantine
Palæologus, who died in 1430. The Panagia
is the only church well preserved—a Latin basilica,
with a portico in the form of an Italian loggia, and
a Byzantine tower added to it. This building is
highly ornamented with delicate carving, and its
walls are in alternate courses of brick and stone,
while the gates, columns, and floor are of marble.
The interior is adorned with Byzantine frescoes of
scenes from the Old Testament. Higher up is the
metropolitan church, built by the Greeks as soon as
William Villehardouin had surrendered the fort in
1263. This great church is not so beautiful as that
already described, but has many peculiarities of no
less interest. The palace of the Frank princes was
probably at the wide place on a higher level, where
the ruined walls show the remains of many Gothic
windows. The citadel was first rehandled by the
Greek Palæologi, then by the Turks, then by the
Venetians, who in their turn seized this mediæval
<pb n='505'/><anchor id='Pg505'/><q>Fetter of Greece.</q> And now all the traces of all
these conquerors are lying together confused in
silence and decay. The heat of the sun in these
narrow and stony streets, with their high walls, is
intense. But you cannot but pause when you find
in turn old Greek carving, Byzantine dedications,
Roman inscriptions, Frankish devices, emblazoned
on the walls. The Turkish baths alone are intact,
and have resisted both weather and earthquake. But
the churches occupy the chief place still, dropping
now and then a stone, as it were a monumental tear
for their glorious past; the Greek Cross, the Latin
Cross, the Crescent, have all ruled there in their
turn. Even a pair of ruined minarets remain to
show the traces of that slavery to which the people
were subject for four hundred years.</q>
</p>

<p>
The occupation of the Frankish knights had not
found an adequate historian, since old Villehardouin,
till Gregorovius wrote his <hi rend='italic'>Mediæval Athens</hi>. The
traveller still sees throughout Greece frequent traces
of this short domination, but all of one sort—the
ruins of castles which the knights had built to overawe
their subjects, and of which Mistra was perhaps
the most important. The same invaders built the
great towers at Kalamata, and most picturesque of
all is the keep over the town of Karytena in
Arcadia, the stronghold of Hugo de Bruyères. But
the Frankish devices which adorned these castles
have been mostly torn down by the Turks, or
re<pb n='506'/><anchor id='Pg506'/>placed by the Venetian lion, according as new
invaders turned the fortifications of their predecessors
to their own uses. Nor are any of these castles
to be compared in size or splendor with those of
northern Europe. The most famous of them, the
palace at Thebes, was so completely destroyed by
the Catalans, that all vestige of it has disappeared,
and we owe our knowledge of it to the description of
the Catalan annalist, Ramon Muntaner, who tells of
the ravages of his fellows not without some stings
of his æsthetic conscience.
</p>

<p>
But let us pass from these complex ruins, which
speak the conflict of the East and West, to the
peculiar quiet homes of the Greek monk, who
spends his time not in works of charity, not in
labors of erudition, not in the toil of education, like
his western brother, but simply in performing an
arduous and exacting ritual, in praying, or rather
in repeating prayers, so many hours in the day, in
observing fasts and vigils, above all in maintaining
the strict creed which has given the title of orthodox
to his Church. These resting-places (<foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">μόνη</foreign> is the
suggestive word) are of course settled in quiet
regions, in the mountains, upon the islands, so that
we cannot expect them near a stirring capital like
Athens. Yet in the gorge of the defile which leads
up to Phyle there is a little <hi rend='italic'>skete</hi> (the house of
<hi rend='italic'>ascetics</hi>) lonely and wild in site; and by the sea on
Salamis, nearly over against Megara, the traveller
<pb n='507'/><anchor id='Pg507'/>will find a small but very characteristic specimen of
the Greek monastery, the <hi rend='italic'>Panagia Phæneromené</hi>.
</p>

<p>
There he will see the tiny cells, and the library,
almost as small as any of them, at the top of dark
stairs, and containing some twenty volumes; he will
be received by the Hegoumenos with mastic and
jam, and then with coffee, and strive to satisfy the
simple curiosity of the old men, who seem so
anxious to hear about the world, and yet have
turned away their eyes from seeing it. Above all,
he will find in the midst of the enclosure a little
model Byzantine Church, built with the greatest
neatness, of narrow bricks, in which string courses
and crosses are introduced by an altered setting of
the bricks. Here too he will see the curious practice,
which led to marble imitations at Venice, of ornamenting
the walls by building in green and blue
pottery—apparently old Rhodian ware, for it is not
now to be found in use. It is a simpler form of the
decoration already described in the Cathedral of
Athens, that of ornamenting a wall with foreign
objects symmetrically disposed, and no one who sees
it will say that it is inartistic. Within are the usual
ornaments of the Byzantine Church, but not in
mosaic; for all the walls are covered with frescoes
by a monk of the early eighteenth century, a genius
in his way, though following strictly the traditions
of the school of Athos. The traveller who ascends
the pulpit will thence see himself surrounded by very
<pb n='508'/><anchor id='Pg508'/>strange pictures—over the west door, as is prescribed,
the Last Judgment, with the sins of men
being weighed in a huge balance, and devils underneath
trying to pull down the fatal scale. The condemned
are escorted by demons to an enormous
mouth breathing out flames—the mouth of hell.
Beatitudes and tortures supply the top and bottom
of the composition. Even more quaint is the miracle
of the swine of the Gadarenes running down a steep
place into the sea. They are drowning in the waves,
and on the head or back of each is a little black
devil trying to save himself from sinking. Similar
creatures are escaping from the statues of heathen
gods which tumble from the walls as the infant Jesus
passes by on his flight to Egypt. This points to the
belief that the statues of heathen gods were inhabited
by an evil spirit, and so far actually bodies with
souls within them!
</p>

<p>
These few details are sufficient to tempt the reader
to visit this monastery, which is far better worth
seeing than the beautifully situated and hospitable
Vourkano described elsewhere in this work. I have
no space to speak of Megaspilion, for this book must
be kept within handy limits, and can never aspire to
even approximate completeness. So also will I here
pass by with a mere mention the eyries of Meteora
in Thessaly, perched upon strange pinnacles of rock,
like S. Simeon upon his pillar. The approach to,
and descent from, these monasteries in a swinging
<pb n='509'/><anchor id='Pg509'/>net is indeed a strange adventure to undergo, and
more painfully unpleasant than most such adventures,
but at the top there is little of interest. The hoards
of precious MSS. which Curzon describes in his delightful
volume, over which the monks quarrelled
when he offered gold, and would not sell them because
none would allow his brother to enjoy the
money—these splendid illuminated books have either
been cozened away by antiquarians, or are gathered
in the University Library at Athens. They are
there in their right place. I understand the peaks
of Meteora, when the present occupants die out, are
to receive not holy men, but criminals, who are to
suffer their solitary confinement not in dungeons beneath
the earth, but far above the haunts of men.
</p>

<p>
But all these monastic settlements pale into insignificance
when we turn to Mount Athos, the real
Holy of Holies of the Greek Church, which is indeed
far from the kingdom of Greece, and therefore
beyond the scope of this work, and yet a chapter on
the mediævalism of Eastern Europe can hardly be
written without some consideration of this strange
promontory, in its beauty surpassing all description,
in its history unique both for early progress and for
subsequent unchangeableness, in its daily life a faithful
mirror of long past centuries, even as its buildings
are now mediæval castles inhabited by mediæval
men. I will here set down the impressions, from a
visit made in 1889, not merely of the art, but of the
<pb n='510'/><anchor id='Pg510'/>life of this, the most distinctive as well as the largest
example of Greek monasticism.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Velificatus Athos</hi> is an expression which has a
meaning even now, though a very different one
from that implied by Juvenal. The satirist would
not believe that Xerxes turned it into an island,
though the remains of the canal are plainly visible
to the present day. But now the incompetence of
the Turkish Government has turned Athos, for English
travellers, into an island, for it may only be approached
by sea. If you attempt to ride there from
Salonica or Cavalla, you are at once warned that you
do so at your own risk; that the tariff now fixed by
a joint commission of Turks, dragomans, and bandits
for the release of an English captive is £15,000;
that you will have to pay that sum yourself, etc. etc.
This is enough to drive any respectable and responsible
person from the enterprise of the land journey,
and so he must wait for the rare and irregular
chances of boat or steamer traffic. It was my good
fortune to find one of H. M.’s ships going that way
from Salonica, and with a captain gracious enough
to drop me on the headland, or rather to throw me
up on it, for we landed in a heavy sea, with considerable
risk and danger, and the <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">τρικυμία</foreign>, as they
classically call it, lasted all day, and raged around
the Holy Mountain. Yet this adventurous way of
landing under the great western cliffs of the promontory,
with the monasteries of S. Paul, Gregory,
<pb n='511'/><anchor id='Pg511'/>and Dionysius, each on their several peaks, looking
down upon us from a dizzy height through the
stormy mists, was doubtless far the most picturesque
introduction we could have had to the long-promised
land.
</p>

<p>
For this had been many years my desire, not only
to see the strangest and most perfect relic now extant
of mediæval superstition, but to find, if possible,
in the early MSS. which throng the libraries of that
famous retreat some cousin, if not some uncle or
aunt of the great illuminated MSS. which are the
glory of the early Irish Church. The other travellers
who have reached this place have done so by
arriving at some legitimate port on the tamer eastern
side; the latest, Mr. Riley,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Athos, or the Mountain of the Monks.</hi> By Athelstan Riley.
Longmans, 1887. This is the newest and best book on the subject.</note> by landing at the
gentlest and most humane spot of all, the bay of
Vatopédi. We, on the contrary, crept into a little
boat-harbor under the strictest, the most primitive,
and far the most beautiful of the western eagles’
nests, whither English pickles, tinned lobster, and
caviare have not yet penetrated. We were doing a
very informal and unceremonious thing, for we were
invading the outlying settlements, to demand shelter
and hospitality, whereas we should have first of all
proceeded to the capital, Karyes, to present pompous
letters of introduction from Papas, Prime Ministers,
Patriarchs, and to receive equally elaborate
<pb n='512'/><anchor id='Pg512'/>missives from the central committee, asking the
several monasteries to entertain us.
</p>

<p>
But we took the place by storm, not by regular
siege. We showed our letters, when we climbed up
to Dionysiu, as they call it, and prayed them to
forestall the hospitality which they would doubtless
show us, if we returned with official sanction. The
good monks were equal to the occasion; they waived
ceremony, though ceremony lords it in these conservative
establishments, and every violation of it
is called a <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">προσβολή</foreign>, probably the greatest sin that a
monk can commit. At every step of our route this
obstacle stood before us, and had we attempted to
force our way past it, no doubt our dumb mules
would have spoken, and reproved our madness.
Yet when they had before them all the missives
which were to be read at Karyes next day, to be followed
up by a letter addressed to themselves, they
actually antedated their hospitality and made us feel
at home and happy.
</p>

<p>
Nowhere have I seen more perfect and graceful
hospitality in spirit, nowhere a more genuine attempt
to feed the hungry and shelter the outcast, even
though the means and materials of doing so were
often very inadequate to Western notions. But let
me first notice the extant comforts. We always had
ample room in special strangers’ apartments, which
occupy the highest and most picturesque place in
every monastery. We always had clean beds to
<pb n='513'/><anchor id='Pg513'/>sleep in, nor were we disturbed by any unbidden
bedfellows, these creatures having (as we were told)
made it a rule of etiquette never to appear or molest
any one till after Pascha, the Feast of the Resurrection.
The feast was peculiarly late this year, and
the weather perfect summer; still the insects carefully
avoided any such <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">προσβολή</foreign> toward us as to
violate their Lenten fast. In addition to undisturbed
nights—a great boon to weary travellers—we
had always good black bread, and fresh every
day; we had also excellent Turkish coffee, and
fortunately most wholesome, for the ceremony of the
place requires you to drink it whenever you enter,
and whenever you leave, any domicile whatever.
Seven or eight times a day did we partake of this
luxury and without damage to digestion or nerves.
There was also sound red wine, and plenty of it,
varying according to the makers, but mostly good,
and only in one case slightly resinated. There were
also excellent hazel-nuts, often served hot, roast in a
pan, and very palatable.
</p>

<p>
What else was there good? There was jam of
many kinds, all good, though unfortunately served
neat, and to be eaten in spoonfuls, without any
bread, till at last we committed the <hi rend='italic'>prosvolé</hi> of asking
to have it brought back when there was bread
on the table. There were also eggs in abundance,
just imported to be ready for Easter, and therefore
fresh, and served <hi rend='italic'>au plat</hi>. Nor had we anywhere
<pb n='514'/><anchor id='Pg514'/>to make the complaint so pathetic in Mr. Riley’s
book, that the oil or butter used in cooking was
rancid. This is the advantage of going in spring,
or rather one of the many advantages, that both oil
and butter (the latter is of course rare) were quite
unobjectionable.
</p>

<p>
When I say that butter was rare and eggs imported,
I assume that the reader knows of the
singularity of Athos, which consists in the absence
of the greatest feature of human life—woman, and
all inferior imitations of her in the animal world.
Not a cow, not a goat, not a hen, not a cat, of that
sex! And this for centuries! Three thousand
monks, kept up by importation, three thousand
laborers or servants, imported likewise, but no home
production of animals—that is considered odious and
impious. And when, in this remote nook of extreme
conservatism, this one refuge from the snares and
wiles of Eve, a Russian monk seriously proposed to
us the propriety of admitting the other sex, we felt
a shock as of an earthquake, and began to understand
the current feeling that the Russians were
pushing their influence at Athos, in order to transform
the Holy Mountain into a den of political
thieves.
</p>

<p>
Nothing is more curious than to study the effects,
upon a large society, of the total exclusion of the
female sex. It is commonly thought that men by
themselves must grow rude and savage; that it is
<pb n='515'/><anchor id='Pg515'/>to women we owe all the graces and refinements of
social intercourse. Nothing can be further from the
truth. I venture to say that in all the world there is
not so perfectly polite and orderly a society as that
of Athos. As regards hospitality and gracious manners,
the monks and their servants put to shame the
most polished Western people. Disorder, tumult,
confusion, seem impossible in this land of peace.
If they have differences, and squabble about rights
of property, these things are referred to law courts,
and determined by argument of advocates, not by
disputing and high words among the claimants.
While life and property is still unsafe on the mainland,
and on the sister peninsulas of Cassandra and
Longos, Athos has been for centuries as secure as
any county in England. So far, then, all the evidence
is in favor of the restriction. Many of the
monks, being carried to the peninsula in early youth,
have completely forgotten what a woman is like,
except for the brown smoky pictures of the <hi rend='italic'>Panagia</hi>
with her infant in all the churches, which the strict
iconography of the orthodox Church has made as
unlovely and non-human as it is possible for a picture
to be. So far, so well.
</p>

<p>
But if the monks imagined they could simply expunge
the other sex from their life without any but
the obvious consequences, they were mistaken.
What strikes the traveller is not the rudeness, the
untidyness, the discomfort of a purely male society,
<pb n='516'/><anchor id='Pg516'/>it is rather its dulness and depression. Some of the
older monks were indeed jolly enough; they drank
their wine, and cracked their jokes freely. But the
novices who attended at table, the men and boys
who had come from the mainland to work as servants,
muleteers, laborers, seemed all suffering under
a permanent silence and sadness. The town of
Karyes is the most sombre and gloomy place I ever
saw. There are no laughing groups, no singing, no
games among the boys. Every one looked serious,
solemn, listless, vacant, as the case might be, but
devoid of keenness and interest in life. At first one
might suspect that the monks were hard taskmasters,
ruling their servants as slaves; but this is not the
real solution. It is that the main source of interest
and cause of quarrel in all these animals, human and
other, does not exist. For the dulness was not confined
to the young monks or the laity; it had invaded
even the lower animals. The tom-cats, which
were there in crowds, passed one another in moody
silence along the roofs. They seemed permanently
dumb. And if the cocks had not lost their voice,
and crowed frequently in the small hours of the
morning, their note seemed to me a wail, not a
challenge—the clear though unconscious expression
of a great want in their lives.
</p>

<p>
How different were the notes of the nightingales,
the pigeons, the jays, whose wings emancipate them
from monkish restrictions; and whose music fills with
<pb n='517'/><anchor id='Pg517'/>life all the enchanting glens, brakes, and forests in
this earthly Paradise!
</p>

<p>
For if an exquisite situation in the midst of historic
splendor, a marvellous variety of outline and
climate, and a vegetation rich and undisturbed beyond
comparison, can make a modern Eden possible,
it is here. Nature might be imagined gradually improving
in her work when she framed the three
peninsulas of the Chalcidice. The westernmost,
the old Pallene, once the site of the historic Olynthus,
is broad and flat, with no recommendation
but its fertility; the second, Sithonia, makes some
attempt at being picturesque, having an outline of
gently serrated hills, which rise, perhaps, to one
thousand feet, and are dotted with woods. Anywhere
else, Sithonia may take some rank, but within
sight of the mighty Olympus, and beside the giant
Athos, it remains obscure and without a history.
Athos runs out into the Ægean, with its outermost
cone standing six thousand five hundred feet out of
the sea, and as such is (I believe) far the most striking
headland in Europe. You may see higher Alps,
but from a height, and with intervening heights to
lessen the effect; you may see higher Carpathians,
but from the dull plain of land in Hungary. Here
you can enjoy the full splendor of the peak from the
sea, from the fringe of white breakers round the
base up to the pale-gray, snow-streaked dome, which
reaches beyond torrent and forest into heaven.
<pb n='518'/><anchor id='Pg518'/>Within two or three hours you can ascend from
gardens of oranges and lemons, figs and olives,
through woods of arbutus, myrtle, cytisus, heath,
and carpets of forget-me-not, anemone, iris, orchid,
to the climate of primroses and violets, and to the
stunted birch and gnarled fir which skirt the regions
of perpetual snow. Moreover, the gradually-increasing
ridge which forms the backbone of the
peninsula is seamed on both sides with constant
glens and ravines, in each of which tumbling water
gives movement to the view, and life to the vegetation
which, even where it hides in its rich luxuriance
the course of the stream, cannot hush the sounding
voice. Here the nightingale sings all the day long,
and the fair shrubs grow, unmolested by those herds
of wandering goats, which are the real locusts of the
wild lands of southern Europe.
</p>

<p>
Each side of the main ridge has its peculiarities
of vegetation, that facing north-east being gentler in
aspect, and showing brakes of Mediterranean heath
ten or fifteen feet high, through which mule paths
are cut as through a forest. The coast facing south-west
is far sterner, wilder, and more precipitous,
but enjoys a temperature almost tropical; for there
the plants and fruits of southern Greece flourish
without stint.
</p>

<p>
The site of the western monasteries is generally
on a precipitous rock at the mouth of one of the
ravines, and commands a view up the glen to the
<pb n='519'/><anchor id='Pg519'/>great summit of the mountain. To pass from any
one of these monasteries to the next, you must either
clamber down a precipice to the sea, and pass round
in a boat commanded by a skipper-monk, or you
must mount the mules provided, and ride round the
folds and seams of the precipices, on paths incredibly
dangerous of aspect, and yet incredibly free
from any real disasters. When you come to a torrent
you must descend by zigzag winding <anchor id="corr519"/><corr sic="still">till</corr> you
reach a practicable ford near the sea-level, and cross
it at the foot of some sounding fall. But the next
projecting shoulder stands straight out of the sea,
and you must climb again a similar break-neck ascent,
till you reach a path along the edge of the
dizzy cliff, where you pass with one foot in the air,
over the sea one thousand feet beneath, while the
other is nudged now and then by the wall of the
rock within, so that the cautious mule chooses the
outer ledge of the road, since a loss of balance means
strictly a loss of life. It was a constant regret to us
that none of the party could sketch the beautiful
scenes which were perpetually before us, or even
photograph them. But the efforts of photographers
hitherto have been very disappointing. There are
indeed pictures of most of the monasteries, taken at
the instigation of the Russians, but all so wretchedly
inadequate, so carefully taken from the wrong point,
that we deliberately avoided accepting them, or
carrying them home. Mr. Riley too, a man of taste
<pb n='520'/><anchor id='Pg520'/>and feeling, had essayed the thing with leisure and
experience in his art, and yet the cuts taken from
the photographs, which are published in his book,
are also hopelessly inadequate. When, for example,
approaching from the north, we suddenly came in
view of Simópetra—standing close to us, across a
yawning chasm, with the sea roaring one thousand
feet beneath, high in the air on its huge, lonely crag,
holding on to the land by a mere viaduct, and behind
it the great rocks and gorges and forests framed
by the snowy dome of Athos in the far background—we
felt that the world can produce no finer scene,
and that the most riotous artistic imagination, such
as Gustave Doré’s, would be tamed in its presence
by the inability of human pencil to exceed it.<note place="foot">The very few travellers who have seen this, the most picturesque
of all European buildings, must have heard with a painful
shock that it was burned down in the spring of 1891.</note> The
plan of this monastery and its smaller brothers (I
was going to call them sisters!) is that of a strong,
square keep, rising straight from the sheer cliffs,
with but a single bridge of rock leading landward,
and when the wall has been carried to a height far
more than sufficient against any attack save modern
artillery, they begin to throw round it stories of balconies,
stayed out from the wall by very light wooden
beams, each balcony sheltered by that above, till a
deep-pitched roof overhangs the whole. The topmost
and outermost corner of these balconies is
<pb n='521'/><anchor id='Pg521'/>always the guest-chamber or chambers, and from
this lofty nook you not only look out upon the sea
and land, but between the chinks of the floor of
boards you see into air under your feet, and reflect
that if a storm swept round the cliff your frail tenement
might be crushed like a house of cards, and
wander into the sea far beneath. To me, at least,
it was impossible to walk round these balconies
without an occasional shudder, and yet we could not
hear that the slender supports had ever given way,
or that any of the monks had ever been launched
into the air. On the divans running round these
aerial guest-chambers are beautiful rugs from
Smyrna and Bulgaria, the ancient gifts of pilgrims
and of peasants, which were thrust aside in the rich
and vulgar Russian establishments for the gaudy
products of modern Constantinople and Athens,
while the older and simpler monasteries were content
with their soft and mellow colors. The wealth of
Athos in these rugs is very great. There were constantly
on the mules under us saddle-cloths which
would be the glory of an æsthetic drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
But it is high time for us to take a closer view of
the inside of these curious castles, some of which,
Vatopédi, Ivíron, Lavra, are almost towns surrounded
by great fortifications, and which possess
not only large properties, outlying farms, dependencies,
but within them a whole population of
monks and their retainers. Let us first speak of
<pb n='522'/><anchor id='Pg522'/>the treasures accumulated within them, relics of
ancient art and industry in the way of books, pictures,
and work in precious metals. The reader will
doubtless appreciate that the estimate of some of
these things depends largely on the taste and education
of the visitor. Mr. Riley thinks it of importance,
in his excellent work, to enumerate the exact
number of chapels contained in, or attached to, each
monastery, whereas to me the exact number, and the
name of the patron saint, seems about the last detail
with which I should trouble my readers. So also
some sentimental travellers enumerate with care the
alleged relics, and Mr. Riley lets it be seen plainly
not only that he is disposed to believe in their
genuineness, but that, if proven, it is of the highest
religious importance. Seeing the gross ignorance
of the monks on all really important matters of history
on the real date and foundation of their several
monasteries, the ascription of a relic to some companion
of our Lord, or some worthy of the first four
centuries, seems to me ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
With this preamble I turn first to the books.
Every convent we visited had a library containing
MSS. The larger had in addition many printed
books; in one, for example, which was not rich
(Esphigménu), we found a fine bound set of Migne’s
<q>Fathers.</q> The library room was generally a
mere closet with very little light, and there was no
sign that anybody ever read there. The contents
<pb n='523'/><anchor id='Pg523'/>indeed consisted of ecclesiastical books, prayer-books,
lesson-books, rituals noted for chanting, of
which they had working copies in their churches.
Still they are so careless concerning the teachings
of their old service books that they have completely
lost the meaning of the old musical notation, which
appears in dots and commas (generally red) over
their older texts, and they now follow a new tradition
with a new notation. When one has seen some
hundreds of these Gospels, and extracts from the
Gospels, ranging over several centuries, some
written in gold characters on the title-page, with
conventional pictures of the Evangelists on gold
ground, one begins to wonder what could have possessed
the good monks to occupy themselves with
doing over and over again what had been done hundreds
of times, and lay before them in multitudes of
adequate copies. I suppose the nature of their
religious worship suggests the true answer. As
they count it religion to repeat over and over again
prayers and lessons all through their nights of vigil
and their days of somnolence, so they must have
thought it acceptable to God, and a meritorious
work, to keep copying out, in a fair hand, Gospels
that nobody would read and that nobody would disturb
for centuries on dusty shelves.
</p>

<p>
In the twelve libraries I examined I did not find
more than half a dozen secular books, and these of
late date, and copies of well-known texts. There
<pb n='524'/><anchor id='Pg524'/>may of course be some stray treasures still concealed
in nooks and corners, though a good scholar,
Mr. Lambros of Athens, has spent much labor in
classifying and cataloguing these MSS. But I saw
chests here and there in out-of-the-way lumber rooms,
with a few books lying in them, and believe that in
this way something valuable may still be concealed.
In general the monks were friendly and ready to
show their books, or at least their perfect manners
made them appear so; but in one monastery (Stavronikíta)
they were clearly anxious that none of
these treasures should be studied. They had not
only tossed together all their MSS. which had been
recently set in order by Mr. Lambros, but had torn
off the labels with which he had numbered them,
without any attempt, or I believe intention, of replacing
them with new ones.
</p>

<p>
As I am not now addressing learned readers, I need
not go into details about the particular books which
interested me. My main object had been to find, if
possible, at Mount Athos some analogy, some parallel,
to the splendid school of ornamentation which has
left us the <hi rend='italic'>Book of Kells</hi>, the <hi rend='italic'>Lindisfarne Gospels</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>St. Chad’s Gospel</hi> at Lichfield, and other such
masterpieces of Irish illumination. I have always
thought it likely that some early Byzantine missionary
found his way to Ireland, and gave the first
impulse to a local school of art. That there is a
family likeness between early Irish and Byzantine
<pb n='525'/><anchor id='Pg525'/>work seems to me undeniable. I can hardly say
whether I was disappointed or not to find that, as far
as Athos went, the Irish school was perfectly independent,
and there was no early book which even
remotely suggested the marvellous designs of the
<hi rend='italic'>Book of Kells</hi>. The emblems of the Evangelists
seemed unknown there before the eleventh century.
There was ample use of gilding, and a good knowledge
of colors. In one or two we found a dozen
kinds of birds adequately portrayed in colors—the
peacock, pheasant, red-legged partridge, stork, etc.,
being at once recognizable. But all the capitals
were upon the same design, all the bands of ornament
were little more than blue diaper on gold
ground. There were a good many books in slanting
uncials, probably seventh to ninth century; an
occasional page or fragment of earlier date, but
nothing that we could see of value for solving the
difficulties of a Scripture text. Careful and beautiful
handwritings on splendid vellum of the succeeding
centuries were there in countless abundance.
They are valuable as specimens of handwriting and
as nothing else. In many of the libraries the monk
in charge was quite intelligent about the dates of the
MSS., and was able to read the often perplexing
colophon in which the century and <hi rend='italic'>indiction</hi> were
recorded. But the number of dated MSS. was,
alas! very small.
</p>

<p>
I now turn to the <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">κειμήλια</foreign> or treasures in precious
<pb n='526'/><anchor id='Pg526'/>metals and gems, which have often been described
and belauded by travellers. Each visitor sees something
to admire which the rest pass over in silence,
or else he is shown something not noticed by the
rest. So the reader must consult first, Curzon, then
Mr. Tozer, then Didron, then Mr. Riley, and even
after that there remain many things to be noted by
fresh observers. The fact is that the majority of
these reliquaries, pictures, and ornaments of the
screen are tawdry and vulgar, either made or renewed
lately, and in bad taste. It is only here and
there that a splendid old piece of work strikes one
with its strange contrast. Far the most interesting
of all the illustrations given by Mr. Riley is that of
the nave of one of the Churches, which are all
(except the old Church of Karyes) built on exactly
the same plan, with small variations as to the lighting,
or the outer narthex, or the dimensions. An
architect would find these variations highly interesting;
to the amateur there seems in them a great
sameness. But among the uniform, or nearly uniform,
features is a huge candelabrum, not the central
one hung from the middle of the dome, but
one which encircles it, hung by brass chains from
the inner edges of the dome, consisting of twelve
(sometimes only ten) straight bands of open-worked
brass, of excellent design, joined with hinges, which
are set in double eagles (the Byzantine emblem),
so that they form large decagons or duodecagons,
<pb n='527'/><anchor id='Pg527'/>in the upper edge of which candles are set all
round. The design and work of these candelabra
appeared to me old. But the monks affirmed that
they were now made in Karyes. This I did not
believe, and in any case my suspicions as to the
antiquity of the design were confirmed by one I
found in St. Paul’s (Agio Pavlo), which bears on one
of the double eagles an inscription that the Hegoumenos
had restored and beautified the church in
1850. But this eagle joined brass bands on which
was a clear German inscription stating that they
were made in Dresden in the year 1660.
</p>

<p>
By far the finest embroideries in silk were at the
rich convent of Iviron, and indeed the main church
there has many features worthy of note. The floor
is of elaborate old mosaic, with an inscription of
George the Founder, which the monks refer to the
tenth century. There are quaint Rhodian plaques,
both set in the outer wall, and also laid like carpets,
with a border of fine design on the walls of the transept
domes. Beside them are remarkable old Byzantine
capitals designed of rams’ heads. But the
great piece of embroidery is a <foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">πόδια</foreign> (or apron of the
Panagia). The ground is gold and green silk, on
which portraits of the three imperial founders are
worked, their crowns of pearls, their dresses of
white silk, their beards of brown silk, and their faces
painted most delicately in colors upon silk. Never
in my life have I seen any embroidery so perfect and
<pb n='528'/><anchor id='Pg528'/>so precious. There were also occasional old crosses
of great excellence, but to describe them here would
be tedious and useless, unless it be to stimulate the
reader to go out and see them for himself; nor can I
recommend this, if he be not a well-introduced
traveller, ready to rough it and to meet with good
temper many obstacles. Travelling in Turkey,
where time has no value, and where restrictions
upon liberty are both arbitrary and unjustly applied,
is a matter of great patience.
</p>

<p>
What shall we say of the services which go on
most of the day and night in these monastic churches,
and which seemed to Messrs. Riley and Owen so
interesting and so in harmony with the Church of
England, that they were never tired of regretting
the separation of Anglican from Greek Christianity,
and hoping for a union or reunion between
them? Mr. Owen went so far as to celebrate the
Eucharist after the Anglican ritual in one or two
of these churches before a crowd of monks, who
could not understand his words, far less the spirit
with which our Church approaches the Holy
Table.
</p>

<p>
Yet here are large companies of men, who have
given up the world to live on hard fare and strict rule,
spending days and nights in the service of God, and
resigning the ordinary pleasures and distractions of the
world. Surely here there must be some strong impulse,
some living faith which sways so many lives. And yet
<pb n='529'/><anchor id='Pg529'/>after long and anxious searching for some spiritual life,
after hours spent in watching the prayers and austerities
of the monks, we could not but come to the
conclusion that here was no real religion; that it was
a mountain, if not a valley, <q>full of dry bones, and,
behold, they were very dry.</q>
</p>

<p>
It is of course very hazardous for a stranger to
assert a negative; there may be, even in this cold
and barren ritual, some real breath of spiritual life,
and some examples of men who serve God in spirit
and in truth. But the general impression, as compared
with that of any Western religion—Roman
Catholic, Protestant, Unitarian—is not favorable.
Very possibly no Western man will ever be in real
sympathy with Orientals in spiritual matters, and
Orientals these monks are in the strictest sense.
They put a stress upon orthodoxy as such, which to
most of us is incomprehensible. They regard idleness
as not inconsistent with the highest and holiest
life. They consider the particular kind of food
which they eat of far more religious importance
than to avoid excess in eating and drinking. How
can we judge such people by our standards? To
them it seems to be religion to sit in a stall all night,
perhaps keeping their eyes open, but in a vague
trance, thinking of nothing, and not following one
word that is said, while they ignore teaching, preaching,
active charity, education of the young, as not
worthy of the anchorite and the recluse. To us the
<pb n='530'/><anchor id='Pg530'/><foreign rend="Greek" lang="el">ἀγρυπνία</foreign> which we attended seemed the most absolute
misconception of the service of God; to the
monks this was the very acme of piety.
</p>

<p>
I have spoken unreservedly of these things, as I
learned that these gentle and hospitable souls were
impossible to please in one respect—they think all
criticism of their life most rude and unjust. They
complained to me bitterly of Mr. Riley’s book, which
they had learned to know from extracts published in
Greek papers, and yet could there be a more generous
and sympathetic account than his? If, then, I
must in any case (though I deeply regret it) incur
their resentment, it is better to do so for a candid
judgment, than to endeavor to escape it by writing
a mere panegyric, which would mislead the reader
without satisfying the monks. Indeed, in one point
I could not even satisfy myself. No panegyric could
adequately describe their courteous and unstinted
hospitality.
