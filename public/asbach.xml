<head>Preface.</head>

<p>
The value of the source-book has long been recognized in
the teaching of general history. In ecclesiastical history
quite as much use can be made of the same aid in instruction.
It is hoped that the present book may supply a want
increasingly felt by teachers employing modern methods in
teaching ecclesiastical history. It has grown out of classroom
work, and is addressed primarily to those who are
teaching and studying the history of the Christian Church in
universities and seminaries. But it is hoped that it may
serve the constantly increasing number interested in the
early history of Christianity.
</p>

<p>
In the arrangement of the selected illustrative material, a
chronological analysis and grouping of topics has been followed,
according to the lines of treatment employed by K.
Müller, F. Loofs, Von Schubert in his edition of Moeller's
text-book, and by Hergenröther to some extent. The whole
history of ancient Christianity has accordingly been divided
into comparatively brief periods and subdivided into chapters
and sections. These divisions are connected and introduced
by brief analyses and characterizations, with some indications
of additional source material available in English.
</p>

<p>
A bibliography originally prepared for each chapter and
section has been omitted. When the practical question arose
of either reducing the amount of source material to admit a
bibliography, or of making the book too expensive for general
use by students, the main purpose of the book determined the
only way of avoiding two unsatisfactory solutions of the problem,
and the bibliography has been omitted. In this there
may be less loss than at first appears. The student of ecclesiastical
<pb n='viii'/><anchor id='Pgviii'/>
history is fortunately provided with ample bibliographical
material for the ancient Church in the universally
available theological and other encyclopædias which have
very recently appeared or are in course of publication, and in
the recent works on patristics. Possibly the time has come
when, in place of duplicating bibliographies, reliance in such
matters upon the work of others may not be regarded as
mortal sin against the ethics of scholarship. A list of works
has been given in the General Bibliographical Note, which the
student is expected to consult and to which the instructor
should encourage him to go for further information and bibliographical
material.
</p>

<p>
The book presupposes the use of a text-book of Church
history, such as those by Cheetham, Kurtz, Moeller, Funk, or
Duchesne, and a history of doctrine, such as those of Seeberg,
Bethune-Baker, Fisher, or Tixeront. Readings in more elaborate
treatises, special monographs, and secular history may
well be left to the direction of the instructor.
</p>

<p>
The translations, with a few exceptions which are noted,
are referred for the sake of convenience to the <hi rend='italic'>Patrology</hi> of
Migne or Mansi's <hi rend='italic'>Concilia</hi>. Although use has been freely
made of the aid offered by existing translations, especially
those of the <hi rend='italic'>Ante-Nicene</hi> and
<hi rend='italic'>Post-Nicene Fathers</hi>, yet all translations
have been revised in accordance with the best critical
texts available. The aim in the revision has been accuracy
and closeness to the original without too gross violation of the
English idiom, and with exactness in the rendering of ecclesiastical
and theological technical terms. Originality is hardly
to be expected in such a work as this.
</p>

<p>
An author may not be conscious of any attempt to make
his selection of texts illustrate or support any particular phase
of Christian belief or ecclesiastical polity, and his one aim may
be to treat the matter objectively and to render his book
useful to all, yet he ought not to flatter himself that in either
respect he has been entirely successful. In ecclesiastical
history, no more than in any other branch of history, is it
<pb n='ix'/><anchor id='Pgix'/>
possible for an author who is really absorbed in his work to
eliminate completely the personal equation. He should be
glad to be informed of any instance in which he may have
unwittingly failed in impartiality, that when occasion presented
he might correct it. The day has gone by in which
ecclesiastical history can not be treated save as a branch of
polemical theology or as an apologetic for any particular
phase of Christian belief or practice. It has at last become
possible to teach the history of the Christian Church, for many
centuries the greatest institution of Western Europe, in colleges
and universities in conjunction with other historical courses.
</p>

<p>
This volume has been prepared at the suggestion of the
American Society of Church History, and valuable suggestions
have been gained from the discussions of that society. To
Professor W. W. Rockwell, of Union Theological Seminary,
New York, Professor F. A. Christie, of Meadville Theological
School, the late Professor Samuel Macauley Jackson, of New
York, and Professor Ephraim Emerton, of Harvard University,
I have also been indebted for advice. The first two
named were members with me of a committee on a <hi rend='italic'>Source-Book
for Church History</hi> appointed several years ago by the
American Society of Church History.
</p>

<p>
That the book now presented to the public may be of service
to the teacher and student of ecclesiastical history is my
sincere wish. It may easily happen that no one else would
make just the same selection of sources here made. But it
is probable that the principal documents, those on which the
majority would agree and which are most needed by the
teacher in his work, are included among those presented.
There are, no doubt, slips and defects in a book written at
intervals in a teacher's work. With the kind co-operation of
those who detect them, they may be corrected when an opportunity
occurs.

Under each period special collections of available sources are to be
found. The student is not given any bibliography of works bearing
on the topics, but is referred to the following accessible works of
reference of recent date for additional information and bibliographies:

<head>The First Division Of Ancient Christianity: The Church Under The Heathen Empire: To A. D. 324</head>

<p>
By the accession of Constantine to the sole sovereignty of
the Roman Empire, A. D. 324, ancient Christianity may be
conveniently divided into two great periods. In the first, it
was a religion liable to persecution, suffering severely at
times and always struggling to maintain itself; in the second,
it became the religion of the State, and in its turn set about
to repress and persecute the heathen religions. It was no
longer without legal rights; it had the support of the secular
rulers and was lavishly endowed with wealth. The conditions
of the Church in these two periods are so markedly different,
and the conditions had such a distinct effect upon the
life and growth of the Christian religion, that the reign of
Constantine is universally recognized as marking a transition
from one historical period to another, although no date which
shall mark that transition is universally accepted. The year
311, the year in which the Diocletian persecution ceased, has
been accepted by many as the dividing point. The exact
date adopted is immaterial.
</p>

<p>
The principal sources in English for the history of the
Christian Church before A. D. 324 are:

the Christian literature of the period, with the exception of
the less important commentaries of Origen.

<head>Period I. The Apostolic Age: To Circa A. D. 100</head>

<p>
The period in the Church before the clash with Gnosticism
and the rise of an apologetic literature comprises the apostolic
and the post-apostolic ages. These names have become traditional.
The so-called apostolic age, or to circa 100, is that
in which the Apostles lived, though the best tradition makes
John the only surviving Apostle for the last quarter of a
century.
</p>

<p>
The principal sources for the history of the Church in this
period are the books of the New Testament, and only to a
slight degree the works of contemporaneous Jewish and
heathen writers. It is hardly necessary to reproduce New
Testament passages here. The Jewish references of importance
will be found in the works on the life of Christ and of
St. Paul. As the treatment of this period commonly falls
under a different branch of study, New Testament exegesis,
it is not necessary in Church history to enter into any detail.
There are, however, a few references to events in this period
which are to be found only outside the New Testament, and
are of importance to the student of Church history. These
are the Neronian persecution (§ 1), the death of the Apostles
(§§ 2, 3), and the persecution under Domitian (§ 4). The
paucity of references to Christianity in the first century is
due chiefly to the fact that Christianity appeared to the men
of the times as merely a very small Oriental religion, struggling
for recognition, and contending with many others coming
from the same region. It had not yet made any great advance
either in numbers or social importance.

<head>§ 1. The Neronian Persecution</head>

<p>
The Neronian persecution took place A. D. 64. The occasion
was the great fire which destroyed a large part of the
city of Rome. To turn public suspicion from himself as responsible
for the fire, Nero attempted to make the Christians
appear as the incendiaries. Many were put to death in horrible
and fantastic ways. It was not, however, a persecution
directed against Christianity as an unlawful religion. It was
probably confined to Rome and at most the immediate vicinity,
and there is no evidence that it was a general persecution.

source for the persecution.
</quote>

<p>
Neither by works of benevolence nor the gifts of the prince
nor means of appeasing the gods did the shameful suspicion
cease, so that it was not believed that the fire had been
caused by his command. Therefore, to overcome this rumor,
Nero put in his own place as culprits, and punished with most
ingenious cruelty, men whom the common people hated for
their shameful crimes and called Christians. Christ, from
whom the name was derived, had been put to death in the
reign of Tiberius by the procurator Pontius Pilate. The
deadly superstition, having been checked for a while, began
to break out again, not only throughout Judea, where this
<pb n='007'/><anchor id='Pg007'/>
mischief first arose, but also at Rome, where from all sides all
things scandalous and shameful meet and become fashionable.
Therefore, at the beginning, some were seized who made confessions;
then, on their information, a vast multitude was convicted,
not so much of arson as of hatred of the human race.
And they were not only put to death, but subjected to insults,
in that they were either dressed up in the skins of wild beasts
and perished by the cruel mangling of dogs, or else put on
crosses to be set on fire, and, as day declined, to be burned,
being used as lights by night. Nero had thrown open his
gardens for that spectacle, and gave a circus play, mingling
with the people dressed in a charioteer's costume or driving in
a chariot. From this arose, however, toward men who were,
indeed, criminals and deserving extreme penalties, sympathy,
on the ground that they were destroyed not for the public
good, but to satisfy the cruelty of an individual.

<quote rend="display">
The work known as the First Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians
was written in the name of the Roman Church about 100. The occasion
was the rise of contentions in the Corinthian Church. The name
of Clement does not appear in the body of the epistle, but there is no
good ground for questioning the traditional ascription to Clement,
since before the end of the second century it was quoted under his name
by several writers. This Clement was probably the third or fourth
bishop of Rome. The epistle was written soon after the Domitian
persecution (A. D. 95), and refers not only to that but also to an earlier
persecution, which was very probably that under Nero. As the reference
is only by way of illustration, the author gives little detail. The
passage translated is of interest as containing the earliest reference
to the death of the Apostles Peter and Paul, and the language used
regarding Paul has been thought to imply that he labored in parts
beyond Rome.

<p>
Ch. 5. But to leave the ancient examples, let us come to the
champions who lived nearest our times; let us take the noble
examples of our generation. On account of jealousy and
envy the greatest and most righteous pillars of the Church
<pb n='008'/><anchor id='Pg008'/>
were persecuted, and contended even unto death. Let us set
before our eyes the good Apostles: Peter, who on account of
unrighteous jealousy endured not one nor two, but many
sufferings, and so, having borne his testimony, went to his
deserved place of glory. On account of jealousy and strife
Paul pointed out the prize of endurance. After he had been
seven times in bonds, had been driven into exile, had been
stoned, had been a preacher in the East and in the West, he
received the noble reward of his faith; having taught righteousness
unto the whole world, and having come to the farthest
bounds of the West, and having borne witness before rulers,
he thus departed from the world and went unto the holy
place, having become a notable pattern of patient endurance.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 6. Unto these men who lived lives of holiness was
gathered a vast multitude of the elect, who by many indignities
and tortures, being the victims of jealousy, set the
finest examples among us. On account of jealousy women,
when they had been persecuted as Danaïds and Dircæ, and
had suffered cruel and unholy insults, safely reached the goal
in the race of faith and received a noble reward, feeble though
they were in body.

It is therefore recorded that Paul was beheaded at Rome
itself, and that Peter was crucified likewise at the same time.
This account of Peter and Paul is confirmed by the fact that
their names are preserved in the cemeteries of that place even
to the present time. It is confirmed no less by a member of
the Church, Caius by name, a contemporary of Zephyrinus,
Bishop of Rome. In carrying on a discussion in writing with
Proclus, the leader of the Phrygian heresy, he says as follows
concerning the places where the sacred corpses of the aforesaid
Apostles are laid: <q>But I am able to show the trophies
of the Apostles. For if you will go to the Vatican or to the
Ostian Way, you will find the trophies of those who laid the
foundations of this church.</q> And that they two suffered
martyrdom at the same time is stated by Dionysius, Bishop
of Corinth, corresponding with the Romans in writing, in
the following words: <q>You have thus by such admonition
bound together the planting of Peter and Paul at Rome and
at Corinth. For both planted in our Corinth and likewise
taught us, and in like manner in Italy they both taught and
suffered martyrdom at the same time.</q>

<p>
What is commonly called the persecution under Domitian
(81-96) does not seem to have been a persecution of Christianity
as such. The charges of atheism and superstition
may have been due to heathen misunderstanding of the Christian
faith and worship. There is no sufficient ground for

bishop of Rome. For bibliography of the persecution under
Domitian, see Preuschen, <hi rend='italic'>Analecta</hi>, second ed., I, 11.

who was also related to him. The charge of atheism
was made against both of them, in consequence of which many
others also who had adopted the customs of the Jews were
condemned. Some were put to death, others lost their property.

<head>Period II. The Post-Apostolic Age: A. D. 100-A. D. 140</head>

<p>
The post-apostolic age, extending from circa 100 to circa
140, is the age of the beginnings of Gentile Christianity on an
extended scale. It is marked by the rapid spread of Christianity,
so that immediately after its close the Church is found
throughout the Roman world, and the Roman Government is
forced to take notice of it and deal with it as a religion
(§§ <ref target="Section_6">6</ref>, <ref target="Section_7">7</ref>);
the decline of the Jewish element in the Church and extreme
hostility of Judaism to the Church (<ref target="Section_5">§ 5</ref>);
the continuance of chiliastic expectations
(<ref target="Section_10">§ 10</ref>); the beginnings of the passion
for martyrdom (<ref target="Section_8">§ 8</ref>); as well as the appearance of the forms
of organization and worship which subsequently became
greatly elaborated and remained permanently in the Church
(§§ 12-15); as also the appearance of religious and moral
ideas which became dominant in the ancient Church
(§§ <ref target="Section_11">11</ref>,
<ref target="Section_12">12</ref>, <ref target="Section_16">16</ref>).
The literature of the period upon which the study
of the conditions and thought of the Church of this age must
be based is represented principally by the so-called Apostolic
Fathers, a name which is convenient, but misleading and to
be regretted. These are Clement of Rome, Barnabas, Ignatius,
Polycarp, Papias, Hermas; with the writings of these are commonly
included two anonymous books known as the <hi rend='italic'>Didache</hi>,
or <hi rend='italic'>Teaching of the Twelve Apostles</hi>, and the
<hi rend='italic'>Epistle to Diognetus</hi>.
From all of these selections are given.<note place="foot"><p>There are three

<head>§ 5. Christianity and Judaism</head>

<p>
The Christian Church grew up not on Jewish but on Gentile
soil. In a very short time the Gentiles formed the overwhelming
majority within the Church. As they did not become
Jews and did not observe the Jewish ceremonial law, a
problem arose as to the place of the Jewish law, which was accepted
without question as of divine authority. One solution
is given by the author of the so-called Epistle of Barnabas,
which should be compared with the solution given by St.
Paul in his epistles to the Galatians and to the Romans. The
number of conversions from Judaism rapidly declined, and
very early an extreme hostility toward Christianity became
common among the Jews.
</p>

<div>
<head>(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) Barnabas, <hi rend='italic'>Epistula</hi>, 4, 9.</head>

<quote rend="display">
The epistle attributed to Barnabas is certainly not by the Apostle
of that name. Its date is much disputed, but may be safely placed
within the first century. The author attempts to show the contrast
<pb n='015'/><anchor id='Pg015'/>
between Judaism and Christianity by proving that the Jews wholly
misunderstood the Mosaic law and had long since lost any claims
supposed to be derived from the Mosaic covenant. The epistle is
everywhere marked by hostility to Judaism, of which the writer has
but imperfect knowledge. The book was regarded as Holy Scripture
by Clement of Alexandria and by Origen, though with some hesitation.
The position taken by the author was undoubtedly extreme, and not
followed generally by the Church. It was, however, merely pushing to
excess a conviction already prevalent in the Church, that Christianity
and Judaism were distinct religions. For a saner and more commonly
accepted position, see Justin Martyr, <hi rend='italic'>Apol.</hi>,
I, 47-53 (ANF, I, 178 <hi rend='italic'>ff.</hi>).

Ch. 4. It is necessary, therefore, for us who inquire much
concerning present events to seek out those things which are
able to save us. Let us wholly flee, then, from all the works
of iniquity, lest the works of iniquity take hold of us; and let
us hate the error of the present times, that we may set our
love on the future. Let us not give indulgence to our soul,
that it should have power to run with sinners and the wicked,
that we become not like them. The final occasion of stumbling
approaches, concerning which it is written as Enoch
speaks: For this end the Lord has cut short the times and
the days, that His beloved may hasten and will come to his
inheritance.… <note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Cf.</hi> Matt. 24:6,

love loving you all more than my own soul, to take heed to

that circumcision should be made in the flesh and not taken spiritually.</note>…
Learn, then, my beloved children, concerning all

looking forward in spirit to Jesus, circumcised, the

hundred men of his household.</q> What, then, was the knowledge
[<hi rend='italic'>gnosis</hi>] given to him in this? Learn that he says the
eighteen first and then, making a space, the three hundred.
The eighteen are the Iota, ten, and the Eta, eight; and you
have here the name of Jesus. And because the cross was to
express the grace in the letter Tau, he says also, three hundred.
He discloses therefore Jesus in the two letters, and the
cross in one. He knows this who has put within us the engrafted
gift of his teaching. No one has learned from me a more
excellent piece of knowledge, but I know that ye are worthy.<note place="foot">ΙΗ

<quote rend="display">
Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna, died at Smyrna February 2, 155, at the
age of at least eighty-six, but he was probably nearer one hundred years
old. He was the disciple of John, probably same as the Apostle John.
His epistle was written circa 115, soon after the death of Ignatius of
Antioch. At present it is generally regarded as genuine, though grave
doubts have been entertained in the past. The martyrdom was written
by some member of the church at Smyrna for that body to send to the
church at Philomelium in Phrygia, and must have been composed soon
after the death of the aged bishop. It is probably the finest of all the
ancient martyrdoms and should be read in its entirety. Translation

Ch. 12. The whole multitude both of the heathen and the
Jews who dwelt at Smyrna cried out with uncontrollable fury
and in loud voice: <q>This is the teacher of Asia, the father of
the Christians and the overthrower of our gods, who teaches
many neither to sacrifice nor to worship.</q> Saying these things,
they cried out and demanded of Philip, the Asiarch, to let a
lion loose upon Polycarp. But he said he could not do this,
since the sports with beasts had ended. Then it pleased them
to cry out with one consent that he should burn Polycarp
alive.…

<head>§ 6. The Extension of Christianity</head>

<p>
It is impossible to determine with accuracy even the principal
places to which Christianity had spread in the first half
of the second century. Ancient writers were not infrequently
led astray by their own rhetoric in dealing with this topic.
</p>

<div>
<head>Justin Martyr, <hi rend='italic'>Dialogus cum Tryphone</hi>, 117. (MSG,
6:676.)</head>

<quote rend="display">
The following passage is of significance as bearing not only upon the
extent to which Christianity had spread, after making due allowance
for rhetoric, but also upon the conception of the eucharist and its
relation to the ancient sacrifices held, by some Christians at least, in
the first half of the second century. <hi rend='italic'>Cf.</hi> ch. 41
of the same work, <hi rend='italic'>v.
infra</hi>, <ref target="Section_12">§§ 12</ref> <hi rend='italic'>f.</hi>
</quote>

<p>
Therefore, as to all sacrifices offered in His name, which
Jesus Christ commanded to be offered, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, in the eucharist
of the bread and cup, and which are offered by Christians
in all places throughout the world, God, anticipating
them, testified that they are well-pleasing to Him; but
He rejects those presented by you and by those priests of yours,
saying: And your sacrifices I will not accept at your hands;
for from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same
my name is great among the Gentiles (He says), but ye have
profaned it.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Cf.</hi> Mai. 1:10-12.</note>
But since you deceive yourselves, both you and
your teachers, when you interpret what was said as if the
Word spoke of those of your nation who were in the dispersion,
and that it said that their prayers and sacrifices
offered in every place are pure and well-pleasing, you should
know that you are speaking falsely and are trying to cheat
<pb n='019'/><anchor id='Pg019'/>
yourselves in every way; for, in the first place, not even yet
does your nation extend from the rising to the setting sun,
for there are nations among which none of your race ever
dwelt. For there is not a single race of men, whether among
barbarians or Greeks, or by whatever name they may be
called, of those who live in wagons or are called nomads or of
herdsmen living in tents, among whom prayers and thanksgivings
are not offered through the name of the crucified Jesus
to the Father and Maker of all things. For, furthermore,
at that time, when the prophet Malachi said this, your dispersion
over the whole earth, as you are now, had not taken
place, as is evident from the Scriptures.

<head>§ 7. Relation of the Roman State to Christianity</head>

<p>
The procedure of the Roman Government against the Christians
first took a definite form with the rescript of Trajan
addressed to Pliny circa A. D. 111-113, but there is no formal
imperial edict extant before Decius on the question of the
Christian religion. In an addition to the rescript of Trajan
addressed to Pliny there is a letter of Hadrian on the Christians
(<hi rend='italic'>Ep. ad Servianum</hi>) which is of interest as giving the
opinion of that Emperor, but the rescript addressed to Minucius
Fundanus is probably spurious, as is also the Epistle of
Antoninus Pius to the Common Assembly of Asia.

Caius Cæcilius Secundus is commonly known as Pliny the Younger,
to distinguish him from his uncle, Pliny the Naturalist, whose wealth
he inherited and whose name he seems to have borne. He was proprætor
of Bithynia under Trajan (98-117), with whom he stood on
terms of friendship and even intimacy. His letter to the Emperor
requesting advice as to the right mode of dealing with Christians was
written between 111 and 113.
</quote>

<pb n='020'/><anchor id='Pg020'/>

<quote rend="display">
This correspondence is of the first importance, as it is unimpeachable
evidence as to the spread of Christianity in the province in which
Pliny was placed, to the customs of the Christians in their worship,
and to the method of dealing with the new religion, which was followed
for a long time with little change. It established the policy that
Christianity, as such, was not to be punished as a crime, that the State
did not feel called upon to seek out Christians, that it would not act
upon anonymous accusations, but that when proper accusations were
brought, the general laws, which Christians had violated on account
of their faith, should be executed. Christianity was not to be treated
as a crime. The mere renunciation of Christianity, coupled with the
proof of renunciation involved in offering sacrifice, enabled the accused
to escape punishment.
</quote>

<p>
Ep. 96. It is my custom, my lord, to refer to you all questions
about which I have doubts. Who, indeed, can better
direct me in hesitation, or enlighten me in ignorance? In the
examination of Christians I have never taken part; therefore
I do not know what crime is usually punished or investigated
or to what extent. So I have no little uncertainty whether
there is any distinction of age, or whether the weaker offenders
fare in no respect otherwise than the stronger; whether pardon
is granted on repentance, or whether when one has been a
Christian there is no gain to him in that he has ceased to be
such; whether the mere name, if it is without crimes, or crimes
connected with the name are punished. Meanwhile I have
taken this course with those who were accused before me as
Christians: I have asked them whether they were Christians.
Those who confessed I asked a second and a third time, threatening
punishment. Those who persisted I ordered led away
to execution. For I did not doubt that, whatever it was they
admitted, obstinacy and unbending perversity certainly deserve
to be punished. There were others of the like insanity,
but because they were Roman citizens I noted them down to
be sent to Rome. Soon after this, as it often happens, because
the matter was taken notice of, the crime became wide-spread
and many cases arose. An unsigned paper was presented
containing the names of many. But these denied that they
were or had been Christians, and I thought it right to let them
<pb n='021'/><anchor id='Pg021'/>
go, since at my dictation they prayed to the gods and made
supplication with incense and wine to your statue, which I
had ordered to be brought into the court for the purpose, together
with the images of the gods, and in addition to this
they cursed Christ, none of which things, it is said, those who
are really Christians can be made to do. Others who were
named by an informer said that they were Christians, and
soon afterward denied it, saying, indeed, that they had been,
but had ceased to be Christians, some three years ago, some
many years, and one even twenty years ago. All these also not
only worshipped your statue and the images of the gods, but
also cursed Christ. They asserted, however, that the amount
of their fault or error was this: that they had been accustomed
to assemble on a fixed day before daylight and sing by turns
[<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, antiphonally] a hymn to Christ as a god; and that they
bound themselves with an oath, not for any crime, but to
commit neither theft, nor robbery, nor adultery, not to break
their word and not to deny a deposit when demanded; after
these things were done, it was their custom to depart and
meet together again to take food, but ordinary and harmless
food; and they said that even this had ceased after my edict
was issued, by which, according to your commands, I had forbidden
the existence of clubs. On this account I believed it
the more necessary to find out from two maid-servants, who
were called deaconesses [<hi rend='italic'>ministræ</hi>], and that by torture, what
was the truth. I found nothing else than a perverse and
excessive superstition. I therefore adjourned the examination
and hastened to consult you. The matter seemed to me to
be worth deliberation, especially on account of the number
of those in danger. For many of every age, every rank, and
even of both sexes, are brought into danger; and will be in the
future. The contagion of that superstition has penetrated
not only the cities but also the villages and country places;
and yet it seems possible to stop it and set it right. At any
rate, it is certain enough that the temples, deserted until quite
recently, begin to be frequented, that the ceremonies of religion,
<pb n='022'/><anchor id='Pg022'/>
long disused, are restored, and that fodder for the
victims comes to market, whereas buyers of it were until now
very few. From this it may easily be supposed what a multitude
of men can be reclaimed if there be a place of repentance.
</p>

<p>
Ep. 97 (<hi rend='italic'>Trajan to Pliny</hi>). You have followed, my dear
Secundus, the proper course of procedure in examining the
cases of those who were accused to you as Christians. For,
indeed, nothing can be laid down as a general law which contains
anything like a definite rule of action. They are not to
be sought out. If they are accused and convicted, they are
to be punished, yet on this condition, that he who denies that
he is a Christian and makes the fact evident by an act, that
is, by worshipping our gods, shall obtain pardon on his repentance,
however much suspected as to the past. Papers, however,
which are presented anonymously ought not to be admitted
in any accusation. For they are a very bad example
and unworthy of our times.

<head>§ 8. Martyrdom and the Desire for Martyrdom</head>

<div>
<head>Ignatius of Antioch, <hi rend='italic'>Ep. ad Romanos</hi>, 4.</head>

<quote rend="display">
Ignatius was bishop of Antioch in the opening years of the second
century. According to tradition, he suffered martyrdom in Rome
under Trajan, circa 117. Having been sent from Antioch to Rome
by command of the Emperor, on his way he addressed letters to various
churches in Asia, exhorting them to seek unity and avoid heresy by
close union with the local bishop. His aim seems to have been practical,
to promote the welfare of the Christian communities rather than
the exaltation of the episcopal office itself. Doubts have arisen as to
the authenticity of these epistles on account of the frequent references
to the episcopate and to heresy. Further difficulty has been caused
by the fact that the epistles of Ignatius appear in three forms or
recensions, a longer Greek recension forming a group of thirteen epistles,
a short Greek of seven epistles, and a still shorter Syriac version of
only three. After much fluctuation of opinion, due to the general
reconstruction of the history of the whole period, which has gone
through various marked changes, the opinion of scholars has been
steadily settling upon the short Greek recension of seven epistles as
authentic, especially since the critical re-examination of the whole
question by Zahn and Lightfoot.

<head>§ 9. The Position of the Roman Community of Christians in the Church</head>

<p>
The Roman Church took very early a leading place in the
Christian Church, even before the rise of the Petrine tradition,
and its importance was generally recognized. Its charity
was very widely known and extolled. It was a part of its
care for Christians everywhere, a care which found expression
later in the obligation of maintaining the faith in the great
theological controversies. On the position of the Roman
Church in this period, see the address of the Epistle of Ignatius
to the Romans (ANF, I, 73), as also the relation of Polycarp
<pb n='024'/><anchor id='Pg024'/>
to the Roman Church in connection with the question of the
date of Easter (see <ref target="Section_38">§ 38</ref>, below).

Eusebius, <hi rend='italic'>Hist. Ec.</hi>, IV, 23. (MSG, 20:388.) For text, see
Kirch, n. 49 <hi rend='italic'>f.</hi></head>

<p>
Moreover, there is still current an Epistle of Dionysius to
the Romans, addressed to Soter, bishop at that time. But
there is nothing like quoting its words in which, in approval
of the custom of the Romans maintained until the persecution
in our own time, he writes as follows: <q>For you have
from the beginning this custom of doing good in different
ways to all the brethren, and of sending supplies to many
churches in all the cities, in this way refreshing the poverty
of those in need, and helping brethren in the mines with the
supplies which you have sent from the beginning, maintaining
as Romans the customs of the Romans handed down from
the fathers, which your blessed bishop Soter has not only
kept up, but also increased, helping the saints with the abundant
supply he sends from time to time, and with blessed
words exhorting, as a loving father his children, the brethren
who come up to the city.</q> In this same epistle he also mentions
the Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians, showing that
from the first it was read by ancient custom before the Church.
He says, therefore: <q>To-day, then, being the Lord's day we
kept holy; in which we read your letter; for reading it we
shall always have admonition, as also from the former one
written to us through Clement.</q> Moreover, the same writer
speaks of his own epistles as having been falsified, as follows:
<q>For when the brethren asked me to write letters, I wrote
them. And these the apostles of the devil have filled with
tares, taking away some things and adding others. For them
there is woe in store. So it is not marvellous that some have
tried to falsify even the dominical scriptures [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the Holy
Scriptures], when they have conspired against writings of another
sort.</q>

<head>§ 10. Chiliastic Expectations</head>

<p>
Primitive Christianity was marked by great chiliastic enthusiasm,
traces of which may be found in the New Testament.
By chiliasm, strictly speaking, is meant the belief
that Christ was to return to earth and reign visibly for one
thousand years. That return was commonly placed in the
immediate future. With that reign was connected the bodily
resurrection of the saints. This belief, in somewhat varying
form, was one of the great ethical motives in apostolic and
post-apostolic times. It was a part of the fundamental
principles of Montanism. It disappeared with the rise of a
<q>scientific theology</q> such as that of Alexandria, the exclusion
of Montanism, and the changed conception of the
relation of the Church and the world, due to the lapse of
time and the establishment of Christianity as the religion
of the State. From the fourth century it ceased to be a
living doctrine.

<quote rend="display">
Papias, from whom two selections have been taken, was bishop of
Hierapolis in Phrygia during the first part of the second century. He
was, therefore, an elder contemporary of Justin Martyr. His work,
<hi rend='italic'>The Exposition of the Oracles of the Lord</hi>, has perished,
with the exception
of a few fragments. The comments of Eusebius in introducing
the quotations of Papias are characteristic of the change that had come
over the Church since the post-apostolic period. That Papias was not
to be regarded as a man of small power simply because he held chiliastic
ideas is sufficiently refuted by the fact that Justin Martyr falls but
little behind Papias in extravagance of expression.
</quote>

<p>
<q>I shall not hesitate, also, to set in order for you with my
interpretations whatsoever things I have ever learned carefully
from the elders and carefully remembered, guaranteeing
the truth of them.… For I did not think that what was to

came from the living and abiding voice.…</q> The same
writer gives also other accounts which he says came to him
<pb n='026'/><anchor id='Pg026'/>
through unwritten traditions, certain strange parables and
teachings of the Saviour and some other more mythical things.
Among these he says that there will be a period of some
thousand years after the resurrection of the dead, when the
kingdom of Christ will be set up in a material form on this
very earth. I suppose he got these ideas through a misunderstanding
of the apostolic accounts, not perceiving that the
things said by them were spoken mystically in figures. For
he appears to have been of very limited understanding, as
one can see from his discourses, though so many of the Church
Fathers after him adopted a like opinion, urging in their support
the antiquity of the man; as, for instance, Irenæus and
any one else that may have proclaimed similar views.

<p>
The elders who saw John, the disciple of the Lord, relate
that they heard from him how the Lord used to teach in
regard to those times, and say: <q>The days will come in
which vines shall grow, each having ten thousand branches,
and in each branch ten thousand twigs, and in each twig ten
thousand shoots, and in each one of the shoots ten thousand
clusters, and on every cluster ten thousand grapes, and every
grape when pressed will yield five-and-twenty metretes of
wine. And when any one of the saints shall lay hold of a
cluster, another shall cry out, <q>I am better cluster, take me;
bless the Lord through me.</q> In like manner [the Lord declared]
that a grain of wheat would produce ten thousand ears, and
that every ear would produce ten thousand grains, and every
grain would yield ten pounds of clear, pure, fine flour; and
that all other fruit-bearing trees, and seeds and grass would
produce similar proportions, and that all animals feeding [only]
on the productions of the earth would [in those days] become
peaceful and harmonious with each other and be in perfect
subjection to men.</q> And these things are borne witness to in
writing by Papias, the hearer of John, and a companion of
Polycarp, in his fourth book; for there were five books compiled
<pb n='027'/><anchor id='Pg027'/>
by him. And he says in addition: <q>Now these things

Ch. 80. Although you have fallen in with some who are
called Christians, but who do not admit this truth [the resurrection]
and venture to blaspheme the God of Abraham and
the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob,<note place="foot">Such were evidently Gnostics,

of the dead and a thousand years in Jerusalem, which will
then be built, adorned, and enlarged as the prophets Ezekiel

<head>§ 11. The Church and the World</head>

<p>
So long as chiliastic expectations were the basis of the
Christian's hope and his judgment of the order of this present
world, the Christian felt that he was but a stranger and
sojourner in the world, and that his real home was the kingdom
of Christ, soon to be established here on earth. With such
a view the Christian would naturally define his relation to
the world as being in it, yet not of it. As time passed, the
opinion became more common that the kingdom of Christ
was not a future world-order to be set up on His return, but
the Church here on earth. This thought, which is the key to
<pb n='028'/><anchor id='Pg028'/>
the <hi rend='italic'>City of God</hi> by St. Augustine, was not to be found in the
first century and a half of the Church.
</p>

<div>
<head><hi rend='italic'>Ep. ad Diognetum</hi>, 5, 6.</head>

<quote rend="display">
The Epistle to Diognetus is one of the choicest pieces of ante-Nicene
literature. Although it is commonly included among the Apostolic
Fathers, the date is uncertain, it is anonymous, and the reason for its
inclusion is not clear. The weight of opinion is in favor of an early
date. It was preserved in but one manuscript, which was unfortunately
destroyed in 1870. The main themes of the epistle are the faith and
manners of the Christians, and an attempt to explain the late appearance
of Christianity in the world. The work, therefore, is of the nature
of an apology, and should be compared with <hi rend='italic'>The Apology of
Aristides</hi>. A translation of the epistle may be found in ANF, I, 23.
</quote>

<p>
Ch. 5. The Christians are distinguished from other men
neither by country, nor language, nor the customs which they
observe. For they neither inhabit cities of their own, nor
employ a peculiar form of speech, nor lead a life which is
marked out by any singularity. The course of conduct which
they follow has not been devised by any speculation or deliberation
of inquisitive men; nor do they, like some, proclaim
themselves the advocates of any merely human doctrines.
But, inhabiting Greek as well as barbarian cities, according
as the lot of each of them has been determined, and following
the customs of the natives in respect to clothing, food, and
the rest of their ordinary conduct, they display to us their
wonderful and confessedly striking method of life. They
dwell in their own countries, but simply as sojourners. As
citizens, they share in all things with others, and yet endure
all things as if foreigners. Every foreign country is to them
as their native land, and every land of their birth as a land of
strangers. They marry as do all; they beget children; but
they do not commit abortion. They have a common table,
but not a common bed. They are in the flesh, but they do not
live after the flesh. They pass their days on earth, but they
are the citizens of heaven. They obey the prescribed laws,
and at the same time surpass the laws by their lives. They
love all men, and are persecuted by all. They are unknown
<pb n='029'/><anchor id='Pg029'/>
and condemned; they are put to death and restored to life.
They are poor, yet they make many rich; they are in lack of
all things, and yet abound in all. They are dishonored, and
yet in their very dishonor are glorified. They are evil-spoken
of, and yet are justified. They are reviled and bless; they are
insulted and repay insult with honor; they do good, yet are
punished as evil-doers. When punished they rejoice as if
quickened into life; they are assailed by the Jews as foreigners
and are persecuted by the Greeks; yet those who hate them
are unable to assign a reason for their hatred.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 6. What the soul is in the body, that the Christians
are in the world. The soul is spread through all the members
of the body, and Christians through the cities of the world.
The soul dwells in the body, but is not of the body; so
Christians dwell in the world, but they are not of the world.
The invisible soul is guarded in the visible body; so Christians
are known as existing in the world, but their religion
remains invisible. The flesh hates the soul and wages war
on it, though it has received no wrong, because it is forbidden
to indulge in pleasures; so the world hates Christians, though
it receives no wrong from them, because they are opposed
to its pleasures. The soul loves the flesh which hates it, and
it loves the members; so Christians love those who hate
them. The soul is enclosed in the body, yet itself holds the
body together; so the Christians are kept in the world as in
a prison-house, yet they themselves hold the world together.
The immortal soul dwells in a mortal tabernacle; so Christians
sojourn amid corruptible things, looking for the incorruptibility
in the heavens. The soul when hardly treated in
the matter of meats and drinks is improved; so Christians
when punished increase more and more daily. In so great
an office has God appointed them, which it is not lawful for
them to decline.

<head>§ 12. Theological Ideas</head>

<p>
In the post-apostolic period are to be traced the beginnings
of distinctive forms of religious and ethical ideas as distinguished
from mere repetition of New Testament phrases.
The most influential writer was Ignatius of Antioch, the
founder, or earliest representative, of what may be called the
Asia Minor theology, which is to be traced through Irenæus,
Methodius, and Athanasius to the other great theologians
of the Nicene period, becoming the distinctive Eastern type
of piety. It probably persisted in Asia Minor after Ignatius.
Among its characteristic features was the thought of redemption
as the imparting to man of incorruptibility through the
incarnation and the sacraments.

<quote rend="display">
The Epistle to the Ephesians is doctrinally the most important of
the writings of Ignatius. In the passage that follows there is a remarkable
anticipation of a part of the Apostles' Creed (<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Hahn. § 1).
The whole passage contains in brief the fundamental point of the
writer's teachings.
</quote>

<p>
Ch. 18. My spirit is an offering<note place="foot">Piaculum.</note>
of the cross, which is
a stumbling-block to unbelievers, but to us salvation and
life eternal. <q>Where is the wise man? where the disputer?</q>
[I Cor. 1:20.] Where is the boasting of those called prudent?
For our God, Jesus Christ, was, according to the dispensation
of God, conceived in the womb of Mary of the seed of David,
but of the Holy Ghost. He was born and baptized, that by
His passion He might purify the water.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 19. And the virginity of Mary was hidden from the
Prince of this World, and her bringing forth, and likewise the
death of the Lord; three mysteries of shouting, which were
wrought in silence of God. How, then, was He manifested to
the world? A star shone forth from heaven above all other
stars, and its light was inexpressible, while its novelty struck
<pb n='031'/><anchor id='Pg031'/>
men with astonishment, but all the rest of the stars, with the
sun and moon, formed a chorus to this star, and its light was
exceedingly great above them all. And there was agitation
whence this novelty, so unlike to everything else. Hence
every kind of magic was destroyed and every bond of wickedness
disappeared; ignorance was removed and the old kingdom
abolished, for God had been manifested in human form
for the renewal of eternal life. And now that took a beginning
which had been prepared by God. Henceforth all things were
in a state of tumult because He meditated the abolition of
death.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 20. … Especially [will I write again] if the Lord
make known to me that ye all, man by man, through grace
given to each, agree in one faith and in Jesus Christ, who was
of the family of David according to the flesh, the Son of Man
and the Son of God, so that ye obey the bishop and the presbytery
with an undivided mind, breaking one bread, which
is the medicine of immortality, and the antidote to prevent
dying, but which is life forever in Jesus Christ.

They abstain from the eucharist and from prayer, because
they confess not that the eucharist is the flesh of our Saviour

Father, of His goodness, raised up again. Those, therefore,
who speak against this gift of God, die while disputing. But
it were better for them to love it, that they also may rise again.
It is fitting, therefore, that ye should keep aloof from such
persons, and not speak of them either in private or public,
but to give heed to the prophets and, above all, to the Gospel,
in which the passion has been revealed to us and the resurrection
fully proved. But avoid all divisions as the beginning

The heresy which the writer fears is that known as Docetism, which

essentially evil, and therefore a pure spirit could not be united to a

crucified and died while those in heaven and those on earth
and those under the earth looked on; who, also, was truly

<head>§ 13. Worship in the Post-Apostolic Period</head>

<p>
The worship of the Christian Church in the earliest period
centred in the eucharist. There are references to this in the
New Testament (<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Acts 2:42; 20:7; I Cor. 10:16). How
far the agape was connected with the eucharist is uncertain.

he applies to the presiding officer at the eucharist. The following
passage is of importance, also, as a witness to the custom of reading,
in the course of Christian public worship, books that appear to be the

<p>
Ch. 61. But I will explain the manner in which we who
have been made new through Christ have also dedicated ourselves
to God, lest by passing it over I should seem in any way
to be unfair in my explanation. As many as are persuaded
and believe that the things are true which are taught and said
by us, and promise that they are able to live accordingly,
they are taught to pray and with fasting to ask God forgiveness
of their former sins, while we pray and fast with them.
Thereupon they are brought by us to where there is water,
and are born again in the same manner of a new birth as we,
also, ourselves were born again. For in the name of God the
Father and Lord of all, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and of
the Holy Spirit, they then receive the washing in the water.
For Christ said: <q>Except ye be born again, ye shall not enter
into the kingdom of heaven.</q> But that it is impossible for
those once born to enter into the wombs of their mothers is
manifest to all.… And this washing is called enlightenment,
because those who learn these things have their understandings
enlightened. But, also, in the name of Jesus Christ who was
crucified under Pontius Pilate, and in the name of the Holy
Spirit who by the prophets foretold all things pertaining to
Jesus, he who is illuminated is washed.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 65. But after we have thus washed him who is persuaded
and has assented, we bring him to those who are called
the brethren, to where they are gathered together, making
earnest prayer in common for ourselves and for him who is
enlightened, and for all others everywhere, that we may be
accounted worthy, after we have learned the truth, by our
works also to be found right livers and keepers of the
<pb n='034'/><anchor id='Pg034'/>
commandments, that we may be saved with the eternal salvation.
We salute each other with a kiss when we conclude
our prayers. Thereupon to the president of the brethren
bread and a cup of water and wine are brought, and he takes
it and offers up praise and glory to the Father of the universe
through the name of the Son and the Holy Spirit, and
gives thanks at length that we have been accounted worthy
of these things from Him; and when he has ended the prayers
and thanksgiving the whole people present assent, saying
<q>Amen.</q> Now the word Amen in the Hebrew language
signifies, So be it. Then after the president has given thanks
and all the people have assented, those who are called by
us deacons give to each one of those present to partake of
the bread and of the wine and water for which thanks have
been given, and for those not present they take away a
portion.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 66. And this food is called by us eucharist, and it is
not lawful for any man to partake of it but him who believes
the things taught by us to be true, and has been washed with
the washing which is for the remission of sins and unto a new
birth, and is so living as Christ commanded. For not as
common bread and common drink do we receive these; but
just as Jesus Christ our Saviour, being made flesh through
the word of God, had for our salvation both flesh and blood,
so, also, we are taught that the food for which thanks are given
by the word of prayer which is from Him, and from which by
conversion our flesh and blood are nourished, is the flesh and
blood of that Jesus who was made flesh. For the Apostles
in the memoirs composed by them, which are called Gospels,
thus delivered what was commanded them: that Jesus took
bread and gave thanks and said, This do in remembrance of
Me, this is My body; and that He likewise took the cup,
and when He had given thanks, said, This is My blood, and
gave only to them. And this the evil demons imitating, commanded
it to be done also in the mysteries of Mithras; for
that bread and a cup of water are set forth with certain explanations
<pb n='035'/><anchor id='Pg035'/>
in the ceremonial of initiation, you either know or
can learn.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 67. But we afterward always remind one another of
these things, and those among us who are wealthy help all
who are in want, and we always remain together. And for
all things we eat we bless the Maker of all things through His
Son Jesus Christ and through the Holy Spirit. And on the
day called the Day of the Sun there is a gathering in one
place of us all who live in cities or in the country, and the
memoirs of the Apostles or the writings of the prophets are
read as long as time allows. Then, when the reader has ceased,
the president gives by word of mouth his admonition and
exhortation to imitate these excellent things. Afterward we
all rise at once and offer prayers; and as I said, when we have
ceased to pray, bread is brought and wine and water, and the
president likewise offers up prayers and thanksgivings as he
has the ability, and the people assent, saying <q>Amen.</q> The
distribution to each and the partaking of that for which thanks
were given then take place; and to those not present a portion
is sent by the hands of the deacons. Those who are well-to-do
and willing give, every one giving what he will, according to
his own judgment, and the collection is deposited with the
president, and he assists orphans and widows, and those who
through sickness or any other cause are in want, and those
who are in bonds, and the strangers that are sojourning, and,
in short, he has the care of all that are in need. Now we all
hold our common meeting on the Day of the Sun, because it
is the first day on which God, having changed the darkness
and matter, created the world; and Jesus Christ our Saviour
on the same day rose from the dead. For on the day before
Saturn's they crucified Him; and on the day after Saturn's,
which is the Day of the Sun, having appeared to his Apostles
and disciples, He taught them these things which we have
offered you for consideration.

<head>§ 14. Church Organization</head>

<p>
No subject in Church history has been more hotly discussed
than the organization of the primitive Christian Church.
Each of several Christian confessions have attempted to justify
a polity which it regarded as <hi rend='italic'>de fide</hi> by appeal to the
organization of the Church of the primitive ages. Since
it has been seen that the admission of the principle of development
does not invalidate claims for divine warrant for a
polity, the acrimonious debate has been somewhat stilled.
There seems to have been in the Church several forms of
organization, and to some extent the various contentions of
conflicting creeds and polities have been therein justified. The
ultimately universal form, episcopacy, may in some parts of
the Church be traced to the end of the apostolic age, but it
seems not to have been universally diffused at that time.
Since Christian communities sprang up without official propaganda,
at least in many instances, and were due to the
work of independent Christian believers moving about in the
Empire, this variety of organization was what might have been
expected, especially as the significance of the organization
was first felt chiefly in connection with the danger from heresy.
That various external influences affected the development
is also highly probable.

<p>
Ch. 42. The Apostles have preached the Gospel to us
from the Lord Jesus Christ; Jesus Christ was sent forth
from God. Christ, therefore, was from God, and the Apostles
from Christ. Both these appointments, then, came about in
an orderly way, by the will of God. Having, therefore, received
their orders, and being fully assured by the resurrection
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and established in the word of God,
with full assurance of the Holy Ghost, they went forth proclaiming
that the kingdom of God was at hand. And thus
preaching through countries and cities, they appointed their
<pb n='037'/><anchor id='Pg037'/>
first-fruits, having proved them by the Spirit, to be bishops
and deacons of those who should afterward believe. Nor
was this a new thing; for, indeed, many ages before it was
written concerning bishops and deacons. For thus saith the
Scripture in a certain place: <q>I will appoint their bishops in
righteousness, and their deacons in faith.</q><note place="foot">Clement alters the
passage slightly; see Is. 60:17.</note>
</p>

<p>
Ch. 44. Our Apostles also knew, through our Lord Jesus
Christ, that there would be strife on account of the office of
the episcopate.<note place="foot">The Greek is ἐπισκοπή
(<foreign lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">episcopē</foreign>),
meaning primarily <q>oversight.</q></note> For this cause, therefore, inasmuch as they
had obtained a perfect foreknowledge of this, they appointed
those already mentioned, and afterward gave instructions
that when these should fall asleep other approved men should
succeed them in their ministry. We are of the opinion,
therefore, that those appointed by them, or afterward by
other eminent men, with the consent of the whole Church,
and who have blamelessly served the flock of Christ in lowliness
of mind, peaceably, and with all modesty, and for a long
time have borne a good report with all—these men we consider
to be unjustly thrust out of their ministrations.<note place="foot">This seems to be the
occasion for this letter to the Corinthians. As they
appear to be several, they correspond to presbyters rather than to bishops, and the use
of the term <q>presbyters</q> in the passage sustains this interpretation.</note> For
it will be no light sin for us, if we thrust out those who have
offered the gifts of the bishop's office blamelessly and holily.
Blessed are those presbyters who have gone before seeing
their departure was fruitful and ripe; for they have no fear
lest any one should remove them from their appointed place.
For we see that ye have displaced certain persons, though
they were living honorably, from the ministration which had
been honored by them blamelessly.

gathered together from the ends of the earth into Thy kingdom;
for Thine is the glory and the power through Jesus
Christ for ever and ever. But let no one eat or drink of this
eucharist [thanksgiving] but they that have been baptized
into the name of the Lord; for concerning this also the Lord
hath said: Give not that which is holy unto the dogs.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 10. After ye are satisfied give thanks thus: We give
Thee thanks, Holy Father, for Thy holy name, which Thou
hast made to tabernacle in our hearts, and for the knowledge
and faith and immortality, which Thou hast made known unto
us through Thy Son Jesus; Thine is the glory forever. Thou,
Almighty Master, created all things for Thy name's sake, and
gave food and drink unto men for enjoyment, that they might
render thanks to Thee; but bestowed upon us spiritual food
and drink and eternal life through Thy Son. Before all
things we give Thee thanks that Thou art powerful; Thine
is the glory forever. Remember, Lord, Thy Church to deliver
it from all evil and to perfect it in Thy love; and gather it
together from the four winds—even the Church which has
been sanctified—into Thy kingdom which Thou hast prepared
for it; for Thine is the power and the glory forever.
May grace come and may this world pass away. Hosanna to
the God of David. If any one is holy let him come; if any
one is not, let him repent. Maran Atha. Amen. But permit
the prophets to offer thanksgiving as much as they will.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 11. Whosoever, therefore, shall come and teach you
all these things that have been said receive him; but if the
teacher himself be perverted and teach a different doctrine
to the destruction thereof, hear him not; but if to the increase
of righteousness and knowledge of the Lord, receive him as
the Lord.

But concerning the apostles and prophets, so do ye according
to the ordinance of the Gospel: Let every apostle coming
to you be received as the Lord; but he shall not abide more
than a single day, or if there be need, a second likewise; but
if he abide three days, he is a false prophet. And when he
departs, let not the apostle receive anything save bread
until he find shelter; but if he ask money, he is a false prophet.
And any prophet speaking in the Spirit ye shall not try,
neither discern; for every sin shall be forgiven, but this sin
shall not be forgiven. Yet not every one that speaketh in
the Spirit is a prophet, but only if he have the ways of the
Lord. From his ways, therefore, the false prophet and the
[true] prophet shall be recognized. And no prophet when he
ordereth a table in the Spirit shall eat of it; otherwise he is
a false prophet.<note place="foot">The sense is: If a prophet speaking in the Spirit
commands a meal to be prepared for the poor and should himself eat of it, it would be
apparent that he ordered it for himself. But if he eats he must be a false prophet.</note>
And every prophet teaching the truth, if
he doeth not what he teacheth, is a false prophet. And every
prophet approved and found true, working unto a worldly
mystery of the Church,<note place="foot">A most difficult and obscure passage. Various
interpretations have been proposed; see the various editions of the Apostolic Fathers,
especially Funk's. The rendering here given is strictly literal.</note>
and yet teacheth not to do what
he himself doeth, shall not be judged before you; he hath his
judgment in the presence of God; for in like manner also
did the ancient prophets. And whosoever shall say in the
Spirit, Give me silver or anything else, do not listen to him;
but if he say to give on behalf of others who are in want, let
no one judge him.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 12. But let every one coming in the name of the Lord
be received; and when ye have tested him ye shall know him,
for ye shall have understanding on the right hand and on the
left. If the comer is a traveller, assist him as ye are able; but
let him not stay with you but for two or three days, if it be
necessary. But if he wishes to settle with you, being a craftsman,
let him work and eat. But if he has no craft, according
<pb n='041'/><anchor id='Pg041'/>
to your wisdom provide how without idleness he shall live
as a Christian among you. If he will not do this, he is trafficking
upon Christ. Beware of such men.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 13. But every true prophet desiring to settle among
you is worthy of his food. In like manner, a true teacher is
also worthy, like the workman, of his food. Every first-fruit,
then, of the produce of the wine-vat and of the threshing-floor,
of thy oxen and of thy sheep, thou shalt take and give as the
first-fruit to the prophets; for they are your chief priests.
But if ye have not a prophet, give them to the poor. If thou
makest bread, take the first-fruit and give according to the
commandment. In like manner, when thou openest a jar of
wine or oil, take the first-fruit and give to the prophets; yea,
and of money and raiment and every possession take the first-fruit,
as shall seem good to thee, and give according to the
commandment.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 14. And on the Lord's day gather yourselves together
and break bread and give thanks, first confessing your transgressions,
that your sacrifice may be pure. And let no man
having a dispute with his fellow join your assembly until
they have been reconciled, that your sacrifice may not be
defiled; for this is the sacrifice spoken of by the Lord: In
every place and at every time offer me a pure sacrifice; for I
am a great king, saith the Lord, and my name is wonderful
among the nations. [Mal. 1:11, 14.]
</p>

<p>
Ch. 15. Appoint [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, lay hands on], therefore, for yourselves
bishops and deacons worthy of the Lord, men meek, not
lovers of money, truthful, and approved; for they also render
you the service of prophets and teachers. Despise them not,
therefore, for they are your honored ones together with the
prophets and teachers.

administered either by the bishop or by him to whom he has

also the multitude be, even as wherever Jesus Christ is there
is the Catholic Church. It is not lawful without the bishop
either to baptize or to make an agape. But whatsoever he

<head>§ 15. Church Discipline</head>

<p>
The Church was the company of the saints. How far, then,
could the Church tolerate in its midst those who had committed
serious offences against the moral law? A case had
occurred in the Corinthian church about which St. Paul had
<pb n='043'/><anchor id='Pg043'/>
given some instructions to the Christians of that city (<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi>
I Cor. 5:3-5; II Cor. 13:10). There was the idea current
that sins after baptism admitted of no pardon and involved
permanent exclusion from the Church (<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Heb. 10:26). A
distinction was also made as to sins whereby some were
regarded as <q>sins unto death</q> and not admitting of pardon
(<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> I John 5:16). In principle, the exclusion from the Church
of those who had committed gross sins was recognized, but
as the Church grew it soon became a serious question as to
the extent to which this strict discipline could be enforced.
We find, therefore, a well-defined movement toward relaxing
this rigor of the law. The beginning appears in Hermas,
who admits the possibility of one repentance after baptism.
A special problem was presented from the first by the difference
between the conceptions of marriage held by the Christians
and by the heathen. The Church very early took the
position that marriage in some sense was indissoluble, that
so long as both parties to a marriage lived, neither could
marry again, but after the death of one party the surviving
spouse could remarry, although this second marriage was
looked upon with some disfavor. Both the idea of a second
repentance and the idea of the indissolubility of marriage are
expressed in the following extract from Hermas:
</p>

<div>
<head>Hermas, <hi rend='italic'>Pastor</hi>, Man. IV, I, 3.</head>

<quote rend="display">
Hermas wrote in the second century. Opinions have varied as to
his date, some putting him near the beginning, some near the middle
of the century. The weight of opinion seems to be that he lived
shortly before 150. His work entitled <hi rend='italic'>The Pastor</hi> is in the form of
revelations, and was therefore thought to partake of an inspiration
similar to that of Holy Scripture. This naturally gave it a place
among Scriptures for a while and accounts for the great popularity of
the work in the early Church. It is the best example of an extensive
apocalyptic literature which flourished in the Church in the first two
centuries.

Ch. 1. If the husband should not take her back [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the
penitent wife who has committed adultery] he sins, and
brings a great sin upon himself; for he ought to take back
<pb n='044'/><anchor id='Pg044'/>
her who has sinned and repented; but not frequently; for
there is but one repentance to the servants of God [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, after
becoming the servants of God]. On account of her repentance
[<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, because she may repent, and therefore should be

<p>
Ch. 3. And I said to him: <q>I should like to continue my
questions.</q> <q>Speak on,</q> said he. And I said: <q>I have
heard, sir, from some teachers that there is no other repentance
than that when we descend into the water and receive
remission of our former sins.</q> He said to me: <q>Thou hast
well heard, for so it is. For he who has received remission of
his sins ought to sin no more, but to live in purity. Since,
however, you inquire diligently into all things, I will point
out this also to you, not as giving occasion for error to those
who are to believe, or have lately believed, in the Lord. For
those who have now believed and those who are to believe
have not repentance of their sins, but they have remission
of their former sins. For to those who have been called before
these days the Lord has set repentance. For the Lord, who
knows the heart and foreknows all things, knew the weakness
of men and the manifold wiles of the devil, that he would
inflict some evil on the servants of God and would act wickedly
against them. The Lord, therefore, being merciful, has
had mercy on the works of His hands and has set repentance
for them; and has intrusted to me the power over this repentance.
And therefore I say unto you,</q> he said, <q>that if after
that great and holy calling any one is tempted by the devil
and sins, he has one repentance. But if thereupon he should
sin and then repent, to such a man his repentance is of no
benefit; for with difficulty will he live.</q><note place="foot">This passage is quoted

<head>§ 16. Moral Ideas in the Post-Apostolic Period</head>

<p>
Christians were convinced that their religion made the
highest possible moral demands upon them. They were to
live in the world, but remain uncontaminated by it (<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>supra</hi>, <ref target="Section_11">§ 11</ref>). This belief
even candid heathen were sometimes forced to admit (<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi>
Pliny's correspondence with Trajan, <hi rend='italic'>supra</hi>,
<ref target="Section_7">§ 7</ref>). The morality of the Christians and the loftiness
of their ethical code were common features in the apologies
which began to appear in the post-apostolic period (<hi rend='italic'>cf. The
Apology of Aristides, infra</hi>, <ref target="Section_20_a">§ 20,
<hi rend='italic'>a</hi></ref>). Christianity was a revealed
code of morals, by the observance of which men might
escape the fires of hell and obtain the bliss of immortality
(<ref target="Section_16_a"><hi rend='italic'>a</hi></ref>)
(<hi rend='italic'>cf. infra</hi>,
<ref target="Section_30">§ 30</ref>). At the same time there was developed
a tendency toward asceticism, by which a higher excellence
might be obtained than the law required of ordinary Christians
(<hi rend='italic'><ref target="Section_16_b">b</ref>,
<ref target="Section_16_c">c</ref></hi>).
This higher morality was not without its compensations;
superior merit was recognized by God, and was
accordingly rewarded; it might even be applied to offset sins
committed (<hi rend='italic'><ref target="Section_16_d">d</ref>,
<ref target="Section_16_e">e</ref></hi>). This last idea is to be traced to the book
of Tobit (cf. also James 5:20; I Peter 4:8). The fuller
development is to be found in the theology of Tertullian and
Cyprian (v. <hi rend='italic'>infra</hi>, <ref target="Section_39">§ 39</ref>).

<p>
Ch. 10. We have received by tradition that God does not
need man's material offerings, since we see that He himself
provides all things. And we have been taught, have been
convinced, and do believe that He accepts only those who
imitate the virtues which reside in Him, temperance and justice
and philanthropy, and as many virtues as are peculiar
to a God who is called by no given name. And we have been
taught that He in the beginning, since He is good, did for
man's sake create all things out of unformed matter; and if
men by their works show themselves worthy of His design,
they are deemed worthy, for so we have received, of reigning
<pb n='046'/><anchor id='Pg046'/>
in company with Him, having become incorruptible and incapable
of suffering. For as in the beginning He created us
when we were not, so we consider that, in like manner, those
who choose what is pleasing to Him are, on account of their
choice, deemed worthy of incorruption and of fellowship with
Him. For the coming into being at first was not in our power;
and in order that we may follow those things which please Him,
choosing them by means of the rational faculties with which
He has himself endowed us, He both persuades us and leads
us to faith.…
</p>

<p>
Ch. 12. And more than all other men are we your helpers
and allies in promoting peace; for we are of the opinion that
it is impossible for the wicked, or the covetous, or the conspirator,
or the virtuous to escape the notice of God, and
that each man goes to eternal punishment or salvation
according to the deserts of his actions. For if all men knew
this, no one would choose wickedness, even for a little time,
knowing that he goes to the eternal punishment of fire; but
he would in every respect restrain himself and adorn himself
with virtue, that he might obtain the good gifts of God and
escape punishment. For those who, on account of the laws
and punishments you impose, endeavor when they offend to
escape detection, offend thinking that it is possible to escape
your detection, since you are but men; but if they learned
and were convinced that it is not possible that anything,
whether actually done or only intended, should escape the
notice of God, they would live decently in every respect, on
account of the penalties threatened, as even you yourselves
will admit.

<head>Period III. The Critical Period: A. D. 140 to A. D. 200</head>

<p>
The interval between the close of the post-apostolic age
and the end of the second century, or from about 140 to 200,
may be called the Critical Period of Ancient Christianity.
In this period there grew up conceptions of Christianity
which were felt by the Church, as a whole, to be fundamentally
opposed to its essential spirit and to constitute a serious
menace to the Christian faith as it had been commonly
received. These conceptions, which grew up both alongside
of, and within the Church, have been grouped under the
term Gnosticism, a generic term including many widely
divergent types of teaching and various interpretations of
Christian doctrine in the light of Oriental speculation. There
were also reactionary and reformatory movements which were
generally felt to be out of harmony with the development
upon which Christian thought and life had already entered;
such were Montanism and Marcionism. To overcome these
tendencies and movements the Christian churches in the
various parts of the Roman Empire were forced, on the one
hand, to develop more completely such ecclesiastical institutions
as would defend what was commonly regarded as the
received faith, and, on the other hand, to pass from a condition
in which the various Christian communities existed in
isolated autonomy to some form of organization whereby the
spiritual unity of the Church might become visible and better
able to strengthen the several members of that Church in
dealing with theological and administrative problems. The
Church, accordingly, acquired in the Critical Period the
<pb n='051'/><anchor id='Pg051'/>
fundamental form of its creed, as an authoritative expression
of belief; the episcopate, as a universally recognized essential
of Church organization and a defence of tradition; and its
canon of Holy Scripture, at least in fundamentals, as the
authoritative primitive witness to the essential teachings of
the Church. It also laid the foundations of the conciliar
system, and the bonds of corporate unity between the scattered
communities of the Church were defined and recognized.
At the same time, the Church developed in its conflict with
heathenism an apologetic literature, and in its conflict with
heresy a polemical literature, in which are to be found the
beginnings of its theology or scientific statement of Christian
truth. Of this theology two lines of development are to be
traced: one a utilization of Greek philosophy which arose
from the Logos doctrine of the Apologists, and the other a
realistic doctrine of redemption which grew out of the Asia
Minor type of Christian teaching, traces of which are to be
found in Ignatius of Antioch.

<head>Chapter I. The Church In Relation To The Empire And Heathen Culture</head>

<p>
In the course of the second century the Church spread
rapidly into all parts of the Empire, and even beyond. It
became so prominent that the relation of the Church to
heathen thought and institutions underwent a marked change.
Persecutions of Christians became more frequent, and thereby
the popular conviction was deepened that Christians were
malefactors. To some extent men of letters began to notice
the new faith and attack it. In opposition to persecution and
criticism, the Church developed an active apologetic or defence
of Christianity and Christians against heathen aspersions.

<head>§ 17. The Extension of Christianity</head>

<p>
Under the head of Extension of Christianity are to be placed
only such texts as may be regarded as evidence for the presence
of the Church in a well-defined locality. It is apparent
that the evidence must be incomplete, for many places must
have received the Christian faith which were unknown to the
writers whose works we have or which they had no occasion
to mention. Rhetorical overstatement of the extension of
the Church was a natural temptation in view of the rapid
spread of Christianity. Each text needs to be scrutinized
and its merits assessed. It should, however, be borne in mind
that the existence of a well-established church in any locality
is in most cases sufficient reason for believing that Christianity
had already been there for some time. In this way valid
historical reasoning carries the date of the extension of the
Church to a locality somewhat further back than does the
date of the appearance of a document which testifies to the
existence of Christianity in a definite place at a definite time.

Since the Church has received this preaching and this faith,

and believes these things as if possessing one mouth. For
although the languages of the world are dissimilar, yet the

<head>§ 18. Heathen Religious Feeling and Culture in Relation to Christianity</head>

<p>
The Christian religion in the course of the latter part of
the second century began to attract the attention of heathen
writers; it became an object of literary attack. The principal
literary opponent of Christianity was Celsus, who subjected
the Christian traditions and customs to a searching
criticism to prove that they were absurd, unscientific, and
false. Lucian of Samosata, does not seem to have attacked
Christianity from any philosophical or religious interest, but
treated it as an object of derision, making sport of it. There
<pb n='056'/><anchor id='Pg056'/>
were also in circulation innumerable heathen calumnies, many
of the most abominable character. These have been preserved
only by Christian writers. It was chiefly in reference to these
calumnies that the Christian apologists wrote. The answer to
Celsus made by Origen belongs to a later period, though
Celsus represents the best philosophical criticism of Christianity
of the latter part of the second century.

</quote>

<p>
I, 1. (MSG, 11:651.) Wishing to throw discredit upon
Christianity, the first point Celsus brings forward is that the
Christians have entered secretly into associations with each
other which are forbidden by the laws; saying that <q>of
associations some are public, others again secret; and the
former are permitted by the laws; the latter are prohibited
by the laws.</q>
</p>

<p>
I, 4. (MSG, 11:661.) Let us notice, also, how he thinks to
cast discredit upon our system of morals as neither venerable
nor a new branch of instruction, inasmuch as it is common
to other philosophers.
</p>

<p>
I, 9. (MSG, 11:672.) He says that <q>Certain of them do
not wish either to give or to receive reasons for those things
to which they hold; saying, <q>Do not examine, only believe and
your faith will save you!</q></q>; and he alleges that such also say:
<q>The wisdom of this life is bad, but foolishness is a good thing.</q>
</p>

<p>
I, 38. (MSG, 11:733.) He admits somehow the miracles
which Jesus wrought and by means of which He induced the
multitude to follow Him as the Christ. He wishes to throw
discredit on them, as having been done not by divine power,
but by help of magic, for he says: <q>That he [Jesus], having
<pb n='057'/><anchor id='Pg057'/>
been brought up secretly and having served for hire in Egypt,
and then coming to the knowledge of certain miraculous
powers, returned from thence, and by means of those powers
proclaimed himself a god.</q>
</p>

<p>
II, 55. (MSG, 11:884.) <q>Come, now, let us grant to you
that these things [the prediction made by Christ of His resurrection]
were said. Yet how many others are there who have
used such wonders to deceive their simple hearers, and who
made gain of their deception? Such was the case, they say,
with Zalmoxis in Scythia, the slave of Pythagoras; and with
Pythagoras himself in Italy.… But the point to be considered
is, whether any one who was really dead ever rose with
a veritable body. Or do you imagine the statements of others
not only are myths, but appear as such, but you have discovered
a becoming and credible termination of your drama, the
voice from the cross when he breathed his last, the earthquake
and the darkness? that while living he was of no help
to himself, but when dead he rose again, and showed the
marks of his punishment and his hands as they had been.
Who saw this? A frantic woman, as you state, and, if any
other, perhaps one of those who were engaged in the same
delusion, who, owing to a peculiar state of mind, had either
dreamed so, or with a wandering fancy had imagined things in
accordance with his own wishes, which has happened in the
case of very many; or, which is most probable, there was
some one who desired to impress the others with this portent,
and by such a falsehood to furnish an occasion to other jugglers.</q>
</p>

<p>
II, 63. (MSG, 11:896.) <q>If Jesus desired to show that
his power was really divine, he ought to have appeared to
those who had ill-treated him, and to him who had condemned
him, and to all men universally.</q>
</p>

<p>
III, 59. (MSG, 11:997.) <q>That I bring no heavier charge
than what truth requires, let any one judge from the following.
Those who invite to participation in other mysteries make
proclamation as follows: <q>Every one who has clean hands and
<pb n='058'/><anchor id='Pg058'/>
a prudent tongue</q>; others again thus: <q>He who is pure from
every pollution, and whose soul is conscious of no evil, and
who has lived well and justly.</q> Such is the proclamation made
by those who promise purification from sins. But let us hear
whom the Christians invite. <q>Whoever,</q> they say, <q>is a
sinner, whoever is devoid of understanding, whoever is a
child,</q> and, to speak generally, <q>whoever is unfortunate, him
will the kingdom of God receive.</q> Do you not call him a
sinner, then, who is unjust and a thief and a house-breaker and
a poisoner, a committer of sacrilege and a robber of the dead?
Whom else would a man invite if he were issuing a proclamation
for an assembly of robbers?</q>
</p>

<p>
VII, 18. (MSG, 11:1445.) <q>Will they not again make this
reflection: If the prophets of the God of the Jews foretold
that he who should come was the son of this same God, how
could he command them through Moses to gather wealth,
to rule, to fill the earth, to put to the sword their enemies from
youth up, and to destroy them utterly, which, indeed, he
himself did in the eyes of the Jews, as Moses says, threatening
them, moreover, that if they did not obey his commands he
would treat them as his open enemies; whilst, on the other
hand, his son, the man of Nazareth, promulgating laws in
opposition to these, declares that no one comes to the Father
who is rich or who loves power or seeks after wisdom or glory;
that men ought to be no more careful in providing food than
the ravens: that they were to be in less concern about their
raiment than the lilies; that to him who has smitten them
once they should offer opportunity to smite again? Is it
Moses or Jesus who lies? Did the Father when he sent Jesus
forget the things he commanded Moses? Or did he change
his mind and, condemning his own laws, send forth a messenger
with the opposite instructions?</q>
</p>

<p>
V, 14. (MSG, 11:1201.) <q>It is folly for them to suppose
that when God, as if he were a cook, introduces the fire, all
the rest of the human race will be burnt up, while they alone
will remain, not only those who are alive, but also those who
<pb n='059'/><anchor id='Pg059'/>
have been dead long since, which latter will arise from the
earth clothed with the self-same flesh as during life; the hope,
to speak plainly, of worms. For what sort of human soul is it
that would still long for a body gone to corruption? For this
reason, also, this opinion of yours is not shared by some of the
Christians,<note place="foot">Probably the Gnostics.</note>
and they pronounce it exceedingly vile and loathsome
and impossible; for what kind of body is that which,
after being completely corrupted, can return to its original
nature, and to that self-same first condition which it left?
Having nothing to reply, they betake themselves to a most
absurd refuge—that all things are possible to God. But God
cannot do things which are disgraceful, nor does he wish
things contrary to his nature; nor, if in accordance with your
wickedness you desire something shameful, would God be
able to do it; nor must you believe at once that it will be done.
For God is the author, not of inordinate desires nor of a nature
disordered and confused, but of what is upright and just.
For the soul, indeed, he might be able to provide everlasting
life; but dead bodies, on the other hand, are, as Heraclitus
observes, more worthless than dung. So, then, God neither will
nor can declare contrary to reason that the flesh is eternal,
which is full of those things which it is not honorable to mention.
For he is the reason of all things that exist, and therefore
can do nothing either contrary to reason or contrary to himself.</q>

<p>
Ch. 11. About this time he made himself proficient in the
marvellous wisdom of the Christians by associating around
Palestine with their priests and scribes. And would you believe
it? In a short time he convinced them that they were
mere children and himself alone a prophet, master of ceremonies,
head of the synagogue, and everything. He explained
and interpreted some of their books, and he himself also wrote
<pb n='060'/><anchor id='Pg060'/>
many, so they came to look upon him almost as a God, made
him their law-giver and chose him as their patron.… At
all events, they still worship that enchanter [mage] who was
crucified in Palestine for introducing among men this new
religious sect.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 12. Then Proteus was, on this account, seized and
thrown into prison, and this very circumstance procured for
him during his subsequent career no small renown and the
reputation for wonderful powers and the glory which he
loved. When, then, he had been put in bonds, the Christians
looked upon these things as a misfortune and in their efforts
to secure his release did everything in their power. When
this proved impracticable, other assistance of every sort was
rendered him, not occasionally, but with zeal. From earliest
dawn old women, widows, and orphan children were to be
seen waiting beside the prison, and men of rank among them
slept with him in the prison, having bribed the prison guards.
Then they were accustomed to bring in all kinds of viands,
and they read their sacred Scriptures together, and the most
excellent Peregrinus (for such was still his name) was styled
by them a New Socrates.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 13. Certain came even from the cities of Asia, sent by
the Christians at the common charge, to assist and plead for
him and comfort him. They exhibit extraordinary activity
whenever any such thing occurs affecting their common interest.
In short, they are lavish of everything. And what is
more, on the pretext of his imprisonment, many contributions
of money came from them to Peregrinus at that time, and he
made no little income out of it. These poor men have persuaded
themselves that they are going to be immortal and
live forever; they both despise death and voluntarily devote
themselves to it; at least most of them do so. Moreover, their
law-giver persuaded them that they were all brethren, and
that when once they come out and reject the Greek gods,
they should then worship that crucified sophist and live
according to his laws. Therefore they despise all things and
<pb n='061'/><anchor id='Pg061'/>
hold everything in common, having received such ideas from
others, without any sufficient basis for their faith. If, then, any
impostor or trickster who knows how to manage things came
among them, he soon grew rich, imposing on these foolish
folk.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 14. Peregrinus was, however, set at liberty by the
governor of Syria at that time, a lover of philosophy, who
understood his folly and knew that he would willingly have
suffered death that by it he might have acquired glory. Thinking
him, however, not worthy of so honorable an end, he let
him go.…
</p>

<p>
Ch. 16. A second time he left his country to wander about,
having the Christians as a sufficient source of supplies, and
he was cared for by them most ungrudgingly. Thus he was
supported for some time; at length, having offended them in
some way—he was seen, I believe, eating food forbidden
among them—he was reduced to want, and he thought that
he would have to demand his property back from the city;<note
place="foot">He had given his property to his native place.</note>
and having obtained a process in the name of the Emperor,
he expected to recover it. But the city sent messengers to
him, and nothing was done; but he was to remain where he
was, and to this he agreed for once.

<p>
Ch. 8. … Is it not lamentable that men of a reprobate,
unlawful, and dangerous faction should rage against the
gods? From the lowest dregs, the more ignorant and women,
credulous and yielding on account of the heedlessness of their
<pb n='062'/><anchor id='Pg062'/>
sex, gathered and established a vast and wicked conspiracy,
bound together by nightly meetings and solemn feasts and inhuman
meats—not by any sacred rites, but by such as require
expiation. It is a people skulking and shunning the light; in
public silent, but in corners loquacious. They despise the
temples as charnel-houses; they reject the gods; they deride
sacred things. While they are wretched themselves, if allowed
they pity the priests; while they are half naked themselves,
they despise honors and purple robes. O wonderful folly and
incredible effrontery! They despise present torments, but
fear those that are uncertain and in the future. While they
fear to die after death, for the present life they do not fear
to die. In such manner does a deceitful hope soothe their
fear with the solace of resuscitation.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 9. And now, as wickeder things are advancing more
successfully and abandoned manners are creeping on day by
day, those foul shrines of an impious assembly are increasing
throughout the whole world. Assuredly this confederacy
should be rooted out and execrated. They know one another
by secret marks and signs. They love one another almost
before they know one another. Everywhere, also, there is
mingled among them a certain religion of lust; and promiscuously
they call one another brother and sister, so that
even a not unusual debauchery might, by the employment
of those sacred names, become incestuous. It is thus that their
vain and insane superstition glories in crimes. Nor, concerning
these matters, would intelligent report speak of things
unless there was the highest degree of truth, and varied crimes
of the worst character called, from a sense of decency, for an
apology. I hear that they adore the head of an ass, that
basest of creatures, consecrated by I know not what silly
persuasion—a worthy and appropriate religion for such morals.
Some say that they worship the genitalia of their pontiff
and priest, and adore the nature, as it were, of their parent.
I know not whether these things be false; certainly suspicion
has place in the case of secret and nocturnal rites; and he
<pb n='063'/><anchor id='Pg063'/>
who explains their ceremonies by reference to a man punished
by extreme suffering for wickedness, and to the deadly wood
of the cross, bestows fitting altars upon reprobate and wicked
men, that they may worship what they deserve. Now the
story of their initiation of young novices is as detestable as
it is well known. An infant covered with meal, so as to deceive
the unwary, is placed before him who is to be defiled with
their rites; this infant is slain with dark and secret wounds
by the young novice, who has been induced to strike harmless
blows, as it were, on the surface of the meal. Thirstily—O
horror!—they lick up its blood; eagerly they divide its
limbs. By this victim they are confederated, with the consciousness
of this wickedness they are pledged to a mutual
silence. These sacred rites are more foul than any sort of
sacrilege. And of their banqueting it is well known what
is said everywhere; even the speech of our Cirtensian<note place="foot">Fronto.
See W. Smith, <hi rend='italic'>Dict. of Greek and Roman Biography</hi>.</note> testifies
to it. On a solemn day they assemble at a banquet with all
their children, their sisters and mothers, people of every sex and
age. There, after much feasting, when the sense of fellowship
has waxed warm and the fervor of incestuous lust has grown
hot with drunkenness, a dog that has been tied to a chandelier
is provoked to rush and spring about by throwing a piece of
offal beyond the length of the line by which he is bound;
and thus the light, as if conscious, is overturned and extinguished
in shameless darkness, while unions of abominable
lust involve them by the uncertainty of chance. Although if
all are not in fact, yet all are in their conscience, equally incestuous;
since whatever might happen by the act of the individuals
is sought for by the will of all.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 10. I purposely pass over many things, for there are
too many, all of which, or the greater part of them, the
obscurity of their vile religion declares to be true. For why
do they endeavor with such pains to conceal and cloak whatever
they worship, since honorable things always rejoice in
publicity, but crimes are kept secret? Why have they no
<pb n='064'/><anchor id='Pg064'/>
altars, no temples, no acknowledged images? Why do they
never speak openly, never congregate freely, unless it be for
the reason that what they adore and conceal is either worthy
of punishment or is something to be ashamed of? Moreover,
whence or who is he, or where is the one God, solitary and
desolate, whom no free people, no kingdoms, and not even
Roman superstition have known? The sole, miserable nationality
of the Jews worshipped one God, and one peculiar
to itself; but they worshipped him openly, with temples,
with altars, with victims, and with ceremonies; and he has
so little force or power that he is enslaved together with his
own special nation to the Roman deities. But the Christians,
moreover, what wonders, what monstrosities, do they
feign, that he who is their God, whom they can neither show
nor see, inquires diligently into the conduct of all, the acts
of all, and even into their words and secret thoughts. They
would have him running about everywhere, and everywhere
present, troublesome, even shamelessly inquisitive, since he
is present at everything that is done, and wanders about in
all places. When he is occupied with the whole, he cannot
give attention to particulars; or when occupied with particulars,
he is not enough for the whole. Is it because they
threaten the whole earth, the world itself and all its stars,
with a conflagration, that they are meditating its destruction?
As if either the natural and eternal order constituted by the
divine laws would be disturbed, or, when the league of the
elements has been broken up and the heavenly structure
dissolved, that fabric in which it is contained and bound
together would be overthrown!

<p>
No general persecution of the Christians was undertaken
by the Roman Government during the second century,
though Christians were not infrequently put to death under
<pb n='065'/><anchor id='Pg065'/>
the existing laws. These laws, however, were by no means
uniformly carried out. The most sanguinary persecutions
were generally occasioned by mob violence and may be compared
to modern lynchings. At Lyons and Vienne, in Gaul,
there was much suffering in 177. The letter from the churches

in this period and should be read by every student.
Under Commodus (180-193), Marcia seems to have aided
the Christians suffering persecution. The <hi rend='italic'>Martyrdom of
Justin</hi> may be found ANF, I, 303, appended to his works.

The martyrdom of Ptolemæus.
</quote>

<quote rend="display">
A certain woman had been converted to Christianity by Ptolemæus.
Her dissolute husband, who had deserted her some time before, was
divorced by her on account of his profligacy. In revenge he attempted
to injure her, but she sought and obtained the protection of the imperial
courts. The husband thereupon turned his attack upon Ptolemæus.
According to Ruinart, the martyrdom took place in 166. See
DCB, arts. <q>Ptolemæus</q> and <q>Justin Martyr.</q> This and the following
martyrdoms illustrate the procedure of the courts in dealing with
Christians.

<p>
Since he was no longer able to prosecute her, he directed
his assaults against a certain Ptolemæus whom Urbicus punished,
and who had been the teacher of the woman in the
Christian doctrines. And he did this in the following way:
He persuaded a centurion, his friend, who had cast Ptolemæus
into prison, to take Ptolemæus and interrogate him only as
to whether he were a Christian. And Ptolemæus, being a
lover of the truth, and not of deceitful or false disposition,
<pb n='066'/><anchor id='Pg066'/>
when he confessed himself to be a Christian, was thrown in
chains by the centurion and for a long time was punished in
prison. At last, when he was brought to Urbicus, he was
asked this one question only: whether he was a Christian.
And again, conscious of the noble things that were his through
the teaching of Christ, he confessed his discipleship in the
divine virtue. For he who denies anything either denies it
because he condemns the thing itself or he avoids confession
because he knows his own unworthiness or alienation from it;
neither of which cases is that of a true Christian. And when
Urbicus ordered him to be led away to punishment, a certain
Lucius, who was also himself a Christian, seeing the unreasonable
judgment, said to Urbicus: <q>What is the ground of this
judgment? Why have you punished this man: not as an
adulterer, nor fornicator, nor as one guilty of murder, theft, or
robbery, nor convicted of any crime at all, but who has only
confessed that he is called by the name of Christian? You
do not judge, O Urbicus, as becomes the Emperor Pius, nor
the philosopher, the son of Cæsar, nor the sacred Senate.</q>
And he, replying nothing else to Lucius, said: <q>You also
seem to me to be such an one.</q> And when Lucius answered,
<q>Most certainly I am,</q> he then ordered him also
to be led away. And he professed his thanks, since he knew
that he was going to be delivered from such wicked rulers
and was going to the Father and King of the heavens.
And still a third came forward and was condemned to be
punished.

When Præsens, for the second time, and Claudianus were
consuls, on the seventeenth day of July, and when Speratus,
Nartzalus, Cittinus, Donata, Secunda, and Vestia were
brought into the judgment-hall at Carthage, the proconsul
Saturninus said: Ye can win the indulgence of our lord the
Emperor if ye return to a sound mind.
</p>

<p>
Speratus said: We have never done ill; we have not lent
ourselves to wrong; we have never spoken ill; but when we
have received ill we have given thanks, because we pay heed
to our Emperor.
</p>

<p>
Saturninus, the proconsul, said: We, too, are religious, and
our religion is simple; and we swear by the genius of our
lord the Emperor, and pray for his welfare, which also ye,
too, ought to do.
</p>

<p>
Speratus said: If thou wilt peaceably lend me thine ears,
I will tell thee the mystery of simplicity.
</p>

<p>
Saturninus said: I will not lend my ears to thee, when thou
beginnest to speak evil things of our sacred rites; but rather
do thou swear by the genius of our lord the Emperor.
</p>

<p>
Speratus said: The empire of this world I know not; but
rather I serve that God whom no man hath seen nor with
these eyes can see. [I Tim. 6:16.] I have committed no theft;
but if I have bought anything I pay the tax; because I know
my Lord, the King of kings and Emperor of all nations.
</p>

<p>
Saturninus, the proconsul, said to the rest: Cease to be of
this persuasion.
</p>

<p>
Speratus said: It is an ill persuasion to do murder, to bear
false witness.
</p>

<p>
Saturninus, the proconsul, said: Be not partakers of this
folly.
</p>

<p>
Cittinus said: We have none other to fear except only our
Lord God, who is in heaven.

[<hi rend='italic'>Cf.</hi> Rom. 13:7.]

Saturninus, the proconsul, said to Speratus: Dost thou
persist in being a Christian?
</p>

<p>
Speratus said: I am a Christian. And with him they all
agreed.
</p>

<p>
Saturninus, the proconsul, said: Will ye have a space to
consider?
</p>

<p>
Speratus said: In a matter so just there is no considering.
</p>

<p>
Saturninus, the proconsul, said: What are the things in
your chest?
</p>

<p>
Speratus said: Books and epistles of Paul, a just man.
</p>

<p>
Saturninus, the proconsul, said: Have a delay of thirty
days and bethink yourselves.
</p>

<p>
Speratus said a second time: I am a Christian. And with
him all agreed.
</p>

<p>
Saturninus, the proconsul, read out the decree from the
tablet: Speratus, Nartzalus, Cittinus, Donata, Vestia, Secunda,
and the rest who have confessed that they live according
to the Christian rite because an opportunity has been
offered them of returning to the custom of the Romans and
they have obstinately persisted, it is determined shall be
put to the sword.
</p>

<p>
Speratus said: We give thanks to God.
</p>

<p>
Nartzalus said: To-day we are martyrs in heaven; thanks
be to God.
</p>

<p>
Saturninus, the proconsul, ordered it to be proclaimed by
the herald: Speratus, Nartzalus, Cittinus, Veturius, Felix,
Aquilinus, Lætatius, Januaria, Generosa, Vestia, Donata, and
Secunda I have ordered to be executed.
</p>

<p>
They all said: Thanks be to God.

<head>§ 20. The Literary Defence of Christianity</head>

<p>
In reply to the attacks made upon Christianity, the apologists
defended their religion along three lines: It was
philosophically justified; it was true; it did not favor immorality,
but, on the contrary, inculcated virtue. The philosophical
defence, or justification, of Christianity was most
brilliantly undertaken by Justin Martyr, who employed the
current philosophical conception of the Logos. The general
proof of Christianity was chiefly based upon the argument
from the fulfilment of prophecy. All apologists undertook to
show that the heathen calumnies against the Christians were
false, that the heathen religions were replete with obscene tales
of the gods, and that the worship of idols was absurd.

<quote rend="display">
The <hi rend='italic'>Apology</hi> of Aristides was long lost, but was found in a Syriac
version in 1889. It was then found that much of the Greek original
had been incorporated in the <hi rend='italic'>Life of Barlaam and Josaphat</hi>, a popular
religious romance of the Middle Ages; see the introduction to the
parallel translations by D. H. McKay in ANF, vol. IX, 259-279.
This work of Aristides may be as early as 125; if so, it disputes with
the similar work of Quadratus the honor of being the first Christian
apology. A large part of it is taken up with a statement of the contradictions
and absurdities of the mythology of the Greeks and Barbarians.
Of this statement, ch. 13, quoted below, is the conclusion.
Then, after a short passage regarding the Jews, the author passes to
an exposition of the faith of Christians and a statement regarding
their high morality.

<p>
Ch. 2. [Found only in Syriac.] The Christians trace the
beginning of their religion to Jesus the Messiah; and He is
named the Son of the most high God. And it is said that
God came down from heaven and from a Hebrew virgin
assumed and clothed Himself with flesh, and that the Son
of God lived in a daughter of man. This is taught in that
Gospel which, as is related among them, was preached
among them a short time ago. And you, also, if you will read
therein, may perceive the power that belongs to it. This
Jesus, therefore, was born of the race of the Hebrews. He
had twelve disciples, that His wonderful plan of salvation
might be carried out. But He himself was pierced by the
Jews, and He died and He was buried. And they say that
after three days He rose and was raised to heaven. Thereupon
those twelve disciples went forth into the known parts of
the world, and with all modesty and uprightness taught concerning
His greatness. And therefore also those at the present
time who now believe that preaching are called Christians
and they are known.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 13. When the Greeks made laws they did not perceive
that by their laws they condemned their gods. For if their
laws are righteous, their gods are unrighteous, because they
committed transgressions of the law in that they killed one
another, practised sorcery, and committed adultery, robbed,
stole, and lay with males, not to mention their other practices.
<pb n='071'/><anchor id='Pg071'/>
For if their gods have done right in doing all this, as
they write, then the laws of the Greeks are unrighteous in
not being made according to the will of their gods. And consequently
the whole world has gone astray.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 15. The Christians, O King, in that they go about and
seek the truth, have found it and, as we have understood from
their writings, they have come much nearer to the truth and
correct knowledge than have the other peoples. They know
and trust God, the creator of heaven and earth, in whom are
all things and from whom are all things, in Him who has no
other God beside Him, in Him from whom they have received
commandments which they have engraved upon their minds,
commandments which they observe in the faith and expectation
of the world to come. Wherefore they do not commit
adultery or fornication, nor bear false witness, nor covet
what is held in pledge, nor covet what is not theirs. They
honor father and mother and show kindness to their neighbors.
If they are judges, they judge uprightly. They do not worship
idols made in human form. And whatsoever they would
not that others should do unto them, they do not to others.
They do not eat of food offered to idols, because they are pure.
And their oppressors they appease and they make friends of
them; they do good to their enemies.… If they see a
stranger, they take him to their dwellings and rejoice over
him as over a real brother. For they do not call themselves
brethren after the flesh, but after the Spirit and in God.
But if one of their poor passes from the world, each one of
them who sees him cares for his burial according to his ability.
And if they hear that one of them is imprisoned or oppressed
on account of the name of their Messiah, all of them care for
his necessity, and if it is possible to redeem him, they set
him free. And if any one among them is poor and needy,
and they have no spare food, they fast two or three days in
order to supply him with the needed food.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Cf.</hi>
Hermas, <hi rend='italic'>Pastor</hi>, Sim. V, 3. ANF, II, 34.</note>
The precepts of their Messiah they observe with great care. They live justly
<pb n='072'/><anchor id='Pg072'/>
and soberly, as the Lord their God commanded them. Every
morning and every hour they acknowledge and praise God
for His lovingkindnesses toward them, and for their food and
drink they give thanks to Him. And if any righteous man
among them passes from this world, they rejoice and thank
God and they escort his body as if he were setting out on a
journey from one place to another.…
</p>

<p>
Ch. 16. … Their words and precepts, O King, and the
glory of their worship and their hope of receiving reward,
which they look for in another world, according to the work
of each one, you can learn about from their writings. It is
enough for us to have informed your Majesty in a few words
concerning the conduct and truth of the Christians. For
great, indeed, and wonderful is their doctrine for him who will
study it and reflect upon it. And verily this is a new people,
and there is something divine in it.

For whatever either law-givers or philosophers uttered well
they elaborated by finding and contemplating some part of
the Logos. But since they did not know the whole of the
Logos, which is Christ, they often contradicted themselves.
And those who by human birth were more ancient than Christ,
when they attempted to consider and prove things by reason,
were brought before the tribunals as impious persons and busybodies.
And Socrates, who was more zealous in this direction
than all of them, was accused of the very same crimes as ourselves.
For they said that he was introducing new divinities,
and did not consider those to be gods whom the State recognized.
But he cast out from the State both Homer and the
rest of the poets, and taught men to reject the wicked demons
and those who did the things which the poets related; and
he exhorted them to become acquainted with the God who
was unknown to them, by means of the investigation of
reason, saying, <q>That it is not easy to find the Father and
Maker of all, nor, having found Him, is it safe to declare Him
to all.</q><note place="foot">See Plato, <hi rend='italic'>Timæus</hi>, p.
28<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>.</note> But these things our Christ did through His own
power. For no one trusted in Socrates so as to die for this
doctrine, but in Christ, who was partially known even by Socrates
(for He was and is the Logos who is in every man, and
who foretold the things that were to come to pass both through
the prophets and in His own person when He was made of like
passions and taught these things), not only philosophers and
scholars believed, but also artisans and people entirely uneducated,
despising both glory and fear and death; since He is
the power of the ineffable Father, and not the mere instrument
of human reason.<note place="foot">For a remarkable passage on the moral influence of

<pb n='074'/><anchor id='Pg074'/>
because they are not in all respects similar, as neither are
those of others, Stoics, poets, and historians. For each man
spoke well in proportion to the share he had of the spermatic
divine Logos, seeing what was related to it. But they
who contradict themselves on the more important points
appear not to have possessed the heavenly wisdom and the
knowledge which cannot be spoken against. Whatever things
were rightly said among all men are the property of us
Christians. For next to God we worship and love the Logos,
who is from the unbegotten and ineffable God, since also He
became man for our sakes, that, becoming a partaker of our
sufferings, He might also bring us healing. For all the writers
were able to see realities darkly through the sowing of the
implanted Logos that was in them. For the seed of anything
and a copy imparted according to capacity [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, to

which there is the participation and imitation according to

Ch. 31. There were then among the Jews certain men who
were prophets of God, through whom the prophetic Spirit
[context shows that the Logos is here meant] published
beforehand things that were to come to pass before they
happened. And their prophecies, as they were spoken and
when they were uttered, the kings who were among the
Jews at the several times carefully preserved in their possession,
when they had been arranged by the prophets themselves
in their own Hebrew language.… They are also in possession
of all Jews throughout the world.… In these books
of the prophets we found Jesus our Christ foretold as coming,
born of a virgin, growing up to manhood, and healing every
disease and every sickness, and raising the dead, and being
hated and unrecognized, and crucified, and dying, and rising
again, and ascending into heaven, and both being and also

called the Son of God, and that certain persons should be sent
by Him into every race of men to publish these things, and

should believe on Him. And He was predicted before He

like those fables that are told of the reputed sons of Jupiter.
For with what reason should we believe of a crucified man
that He is the first-born of the unbegotten God, and Himself
will pass judgment on the whole human race, unless we found
testimonies concerning Him published before He came and
was born as a man, and unless we saw that things had happened

<head>Chapter II. The Internal Crisis: The Gnostic And Other Heretical Sects</head>

<p>
In the second century the Church passed through an internal
crisis even more trying than the great persecutions of
the following centuries and with results far more momentous.
Of the conditions making possible such a crisis the most
important was absence in the Church of norms of faith universally
acknowledged as binding. Then, again, many had
embraced Christianity without grasping the spirit of the
new religion. Nearly all interpreted the Christian faith more
or less according to their earlier philosophical or religious
conceptions; <hi rend='italic'>e.g.</hi>, the apologists within the Church used the
philosophical Logos doctrine. In this way arose numerous interpretations
of Christian teaching and perversions of that
teaching, some not at all in harmony with the generally
received tradition. These discordant interpretations or perversions
<pb n='076'/><anchor id='Pg076'/>
are the heretical movements of the second century.
They varied in every degree of departure from the generally
accepted Christian tradition. Some, like the earlier Gnostics
(<ref target="Section_21">§ 21</ref>), and even the greater Gnostic systems
(<ref target="Section_22">§ 22</ref>), at least
in their esoteric teaching, show that their principal inspiration
was other than Christian; others, as the Gnosticism of
Marcion (<ref target="Section_23">§ 23</ref>) and the enthusiastic sect of the Montanists
(<ref target="Section_25">§ 25</ref>), seem to have built largely upon exaggerated
Christian tenets, contained, indeed, in the New Testament, but not
fully appreciated by the majority of Christians; or still others,
as the Encratites (<ref target="Section_24">§ 24</ref>), laid undue stress upon what was
generally recognized as an element of Christian morality.
</p>

<p>
The principal source materials for the history of Gnosticism and
other heresies of this chapter may be found collected and provided

<head>§ 21. The Earlier Gnostics: Gnosticism in General</head>

<p>
Gnosticism is a generic name for a vast number of syncretistic
religious systems prevalent, especially in the East, both
before and after the Christian era. For the most part the
movement was outside of Christianity, and was already dying
out when Christianity appeared. It derived its essential features
from Persian and Babylonian sources and was markedly
dualistic. As it spread toward the West, it adopted many
Western elements, making use of Christian ideas and terms
and Greek philosophical concepts. Modified by such new
matter, it obtained a renewed lease of life. In proportion as
the various schools of Gnosticism became more influenced by
Christian elements, they were more easily confused with
<pb n='077'/><anchor id='Pg077'/>
Christianity, and accordingly more dangerous to it. Among
such were the greater schools of Basilides and Valentinus
(see <ref target="Section_22">next section</ref>). The doctrines of Gnosticism were held by
many who were nominally within the Church. The tendency
of the Gnostics and their adherents was to form little coteries
and to keep much of their teaching secret from those who
were attracted by their more popular tenets. The esoteric
element seems to have been the so-called <q>systems</q> in which
the fanciful and mythological element in Gnosticism appears.
This, as being the most vulnerable part of the Gnostic teaching,
was attacked most bitterly by the opponents of heresy.
There are no extant writings of the earlier Gnostics, Simon,
Menander, or Cerinthus. They are known only from Christian
opponents.
</p>

<p>
Sources for the history of Gnosticism: The leading sources
are the Church Fathers Irenæus, Hippolytus, Tertullian, Clement
of Alexandria (all translated in ANF), Origen (in part only
translated in ANF), and Epiphanius. The accounts of these
bitter enemies must necessarily be used with caution. They
contain, however, numerous fragments from Gnostic writings.
The fragments in the ante-Nicene Fathers may be found in
A. Hilgenfeld, <hi rend='italic'>op. cit.</hi>, in Greek, with commentary. For the
literary remains of Gnosticism, see Krüger, §§ 22-31. The
more accessible are: <hi rend='italic'>Acts of Thomas</hi> (best Greek text by
Bonnet, Leipsic, 1903, German translation with excellent
commentary in E. Hennecke, <hi rend='italic'>Neutestamentliche Apokryphen</hi>,
Tübingen and Leipsic, 1904); Ptolemæus, <hi rend='italic'>Epistle to Flora</hi>
(in Epiphanius, <hi rend='italic'>Panarion</hi>, Hær. XXXIII); <hi rend='italic'>Hymn of
the Soul</hi>, from the <hi rend='italic'>Acts of Thomas</hi> (text and English
translation by Bevan in <hi rend='italic'>Text and Studies</hi>, V, 3, Cambridge, 1897,
also translated in F. C. Burkitt, <hi rend='italic'>Early Eastern Christianity</hi>,
N. Y., 1904).
</p>

<head>(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) Tertullian, <hi rend='italic'>De Præscriptione
Hæreticorum</hi>, 7. (MSL, 2:21.)</head>

<quote rend="display">
A wide-spread opinion that Gnosticism was fundamentally a perversion
of Christianity finds its most striking expression in the phrase
of Harnack that it was <q>the acute secularizing or Hellenizing of Christianity</q>
<pb n='078'/><anchor id='Pg078'/>
(<hi rend='italic'>History of Dogma</hi>, English translation, I, 226). The foundation
for this representation is the later Gnosticism, which took over many
Christian and Greek elements, and the opinion of Tertullian that
Gnosticism and Greek philosophy discussed the same questions and
held the same opinions. (<hi rend='italic'>Cf.</hi> the thesis of Hippolytus in his
<hi rend='italic'>Philosophumena, or the Refutation of All Heresies</hi>; see the
Proemium, ANF, V, 9 <hi rend='italic'>f.</hi>, and especially bk. VII.) Tertullian,
although retaining unconsciously the impress of his former Stoicism, was violently
opposed to philosophy, and in his denunciation of heresy felt that it was a powerful
argument against the Gnostics to show similarities between their teaching
and the Greek philosophy he so heartily detested. It is a brilliant
work and may be taken as a fair specimen of Tertullian's style.

<p>
These are the doctrines of men and of demons born of the
spirit of this world's wisdom, for itching ears; and the Lord,
calling this foolishness, chose the foolish things of this world
to the confusion of philosophy itself. For philosophy is the
material of the world's wisdom, the rash interpreter of the
nature and dispensation of God. Indeed, heresies themselves
are instigated by philosophy. From this source came the
eons, and I know not what infinite forms, and the trinity of
man in the system of Valentinus; he was of Plato's school.
From this source came Marcion's better god with all his
tranquillity; he came of the Stoics. Then again the opinion
that the soul dies is held by the Epicureans. The denial of the
resurrection of the body is taken from the united schools of
all philosophers. When matter is made equal to God, you
have the teaching of Zeno; and when anything is alleged
touching a fiery god, then Heraclitus comes in. The same
subject-matter is discussed over and over again by the heretics
and the philosophers; the same arguments are involved.
Whence and wherefore is evil? Whence and how has come
man? Besides these there is the question which Valentinus
has very recently proposed, Whence comes God?

Simon the Samaritan, that magician of whom Luke, the
disciple and follower of the Apostles, says: <q>But there was a
certain man, Simon by name,</q> etc. [Acts 8:9-11, 20, 21, 23.]
Since he did not put his faith in God a whit more, he
set himself eagerly to contend against the Apostles, in order
that he himself might seem to be a wonderful being, and
studied with still greater zeal the whole range of magic art,
that he might the better bewilder the multitude of men.
Such was his procedure in the reign of Claudius Cæsar, by
whom also he is said to have been honored with a statue on
account of his magic. This man, then, was glorified by many
as a god, and he taught that it was he himself who appeared
among the Jews as the Son, but descended in Samaria as the
Father, while he came to other nations in the character of
the Holy Spirit. He represented himself as the loftiest of all
powers, that it is he who is over all as the Father, and he
allowed himself to be called whatsoever men might name him.
</p>

<p>
Now this Simon of Samaria, from whom all heresies derive
their origin, has as the material for his sect the following:
Having redeemed from slavery at Tyre, a city of Phœnicia, a
certain woman named Helena,<note place="foot">For a discussion of this Helena, see
Bousset, <hi rend='italic'>Die Hauptprobleme der Gnosis</hi>,
1907, pp. 77 <hi rend='italic'>ff.</hi></note> a prostitute, he was in the
habit of carrying her about with him, declaring that she was
the first conception [<hi rend='italic'>Ennœa</hi>] of his mind, the mother of all, by
whom he conceived in his mind to make the angels and archangels.
For this Ennœa, leaping forth from him and comprehending
the will of her father, descended to the lower regions
and generated angels and powers, by whom, also, he declared
this world was made. But after she had generated them she
was detained by them through jealousy, because they were
unwilling that they should be regarded as the progeny of
any other being. As to himself, he was wholly unknown to
them, but his Ennœa was detained by those powers and
<pb n='080'/><anchor id='Pg080'/>
angels who had been produced by her. She suffered all kinds
of contumely from them, so that she could not return upward
to her father, but was even shut up in a human body and for
ages passed in succession from one female body to another,
as from one vessel to another vessel. She was in that Helen
on whose account the Trojan War was undertaken; wherefore
also Stesichorus was struck blind, because he cursed her
in his poems; but afterward, when he had repented and
written those verses which are called palinodes, in which he
sung her praises, he saw once more. Thus passing from
body to body and suffering insults in every one of them, she
at last became a common prostitute; and she it is who was
the lost sheep.
</p>

<p>
For this purpose he himself had come, that he might win
her first and free her from chains, and confer salvation upon
men by making himself known to them. For since the angels
ruled the world poorly, because each one of them coveted the
principal power, he had come to mend matters and had descended,
been transfigured and assimilated to powers and
angels, so that he might appear among men as man, although
he was not a man; and that he was supposed to have suffered
in Judea, although he had not suffered. Moreover, the prophets
inspired by the angels, who were the makers of the world,
pronounced their prophecies; for which reason those who place
their trust in him and Helena no longer regard them, but are
free to do what they will; for men are saved according to
his grace, and not according to their righteous works. For
deeds are not righteous in the nature of things, but by mere
accident and just as those angels who made the world have
determined, seeking by such precepts to bring men into bondage.
On this account he promised that the world should
be dissolved and that those who are his should be freed from
the rule of them who made the world.
</p>

<p>
Thus, then, the mystic priests belonging to this sect both
live profligately and practise magical arts, each one to the
extent of his ability. They use exorcisms and incantations,
<pb n='081'/><anchor id='Pg081'/>
love-potions, also, and charms, as well as those beings who are
called <q>familiars</q> [<hi rend='italic'>paredri</hi>] and "dream senders"
[<hi rend='italic'>oniropompi</hi>], and whatever other curious arts can be had are
eagerly pressed into their service.

The successor of Simon Magus was Menander, a Samaritan

affirms that the first power is unknown to all, but that he
himself is the person who has been sent forth by the invisible
beings as a saviour for the salvation of men. The world was
made by angels, who, as he also, like Simon, says, were produced
by the Ennœa, He gives also, as he affirms, by means
of the magic which he teaches knowledge, so that one may
overcome those angels that made the world. For his disciples
obtain the resurrection by the fact that they are baptized
into him, and they can die no more, but remain immortal
without ever growing old.

<head>§ 22. The Greater Gnostic Systems: Basilides and Valentinus</head>

<p>
The Gnostic systems having most influence within the
Church and effect upon its development were those of Basilides
and Valentinus. Of these teachers and their followers
we have not only the accounts of those opponents who
attacked principally their esoteric and most characteristically
Gnostic tenets, but also fragments and other remains which
give a more favorable impression of the religious and moral
value of the great schools of Gnosticism. In their <q>systems</q>
of vast theogonies and cosmologies, in their wild mythological
treatment of the most abstract conceptions and their
dualism, the Church writers naturally saw at once their most
vulnerable and most dangerous element.
</p>

<div>
<head>A. The School of Basilides</head>

<p>
The school of Basilides marks the beginning of the distinctively
Hellenistic stadium of Gnosticism. Basilides, its
founder, apparently worked first in the East; circa 120-130
he was at Alexandria. He was the first important Gnostic
writer. Of his Gospel, Commentary on that Gospel in twenty-four
books (<hi rend='italic'>Exegetica</hi>), and his odes only fragments remain of
the second, preserved by Clement of Alexandria and in the <hi rend='italic'>Acta
Archelai</hi> (collected by Hilgenfeld, <hi rend='italic'>Ketzergeschichte</hi>, 207-213).
</p>

<p>

(=VII, 1-15, X, 10, ANF, V); Eusebius, <hi rend='italic'>Hist. Ec.</hi>, IV. 7. The account
of Hippolytus differs markedly from that of Irenæus, and his quotations
and references have been the subject of long dispute among scholars.

exists only in a Latin translation probably from a Greek original.

<p>
Among the Persians there was also a certain preacher, one
Basilides, of more ancient date, not long after the time of our
Apostles. Since he was of a shrewd disposition himself, and
observed that at that time all other subjects were preoccupied,
he determined to affirm that dualism which was maintained
also by Scythianus. And so, since he had nothing to advance
which he might call his own, he brought the sayings of others
before his adversaries. And all his books contain some
matters difficult and extremely harsh. The thirteenth book
of his Tractates,<note place="foot">Probably to be identified with his
<hi rend='italic'>Exegetica</hi>.</note> however, is still extant, which begins thus:
<q>In writing the thirteenth book of our Tractates, the word
of salvation furnished us with the necessary and fruitful word.
It illustrates<note place="foot">Query: the antagonism between good and evil.</note>
under the figure of a rich [principle] and a poor
[principle], a nature without root and without place and only
supervenes upon things.<note place="foot">Very obscure: see ANF, and Routh,
<hi rend='italic'>ad loc.</hi>, and Neander, <hi rend='italic'>Ch. Hist.</hi>, I,
402.</note> This is the only topic which the
book contains.</q> Does it not, then, contain a strange word, as
also certain persons think? Will ye not all be offended with
the book itself, of which this is the beginning? But Basilides,
returning to the subject, some five hundred lines intervening,
more or less, says: <q>Give up this vain and curious variation,
and let us rather find out what inquiries the Barbarians [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>,
the Persians] have instituted concerning good and evil, and
to what opinions they have come on all these subjects. For
certain among them have said that there are for all things
two beginnings [or principles], to which they have referred
good and evil, holding these principles are without beginning
and ingenerate; that is to say, that in the origins of things
there were light and darkness, which existed of themselves,
and which were not declared to exist.<note place="foot">Routh, <hi rend='italic'>loc.
cit.</hi>, proposes as an emendation, <q>declared to be made.</q></note>
When these subsisted
<pb n='084'/><anchor id='Pg084'/>
by themselves, they each led its own proper mode of life
as it willed to lead, and such as was competent to it. For
in the case of all things, what is proper to it is in amity with
it, and nothing seems evil to itself. But after they came to
the knowledge of each other, and after the darkness contemplated
the light, then, as if fired with a passion for something
superior, the darkness rushed to have intercourse with the
light.</q>

human suffering. <hi rend='italic'>Cf.</hi> Origen in <hi rend='italic'>Ep. ad Rom.</hi>,
V: <q>I [Paul], he says, died
[Rom. 7:9], for now sin began to be reckoned unto me. But Basilides,
not noticing that these things ought to be understood of the natural
law, according to impious and foolish fables turns this apostolic saying
into the Pythagorean dogma, that is, attempts to prove from this
word of the Apostle that souls are transferred from one body to
another. For he says that the Apostle has said, <q>I lived without any
law</q>—<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, before I came into the body I lived in that sort
of body which is not under the law, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, of beasts and birds.</q>
</quote>

<p>
Basilides, in the twenty-third book of the Exegetics, respecting
those that are punished by martyrdom, expresses
himself in the following language: <q>For I say this, Whosoever
fall under the afflictions mentioned, in consequence of
unconsciously transgressing in other matters, are brought to
this good end by the kindness of Him who brings about all
things, though they are accused on other grounds; so that
they may not suffer as condemned for what are acknowledged
to be iniquities, nor reproached as the adulterer or the murderer,
but because they are Christians; which will console
them, so that they do not appear to suffer. And if one who
has not sinned at all incur suffering (a rare case), yet even
he will not suffer aught through the machinations of power,
but will suffer as the child which seems not to have sinned
would suffer.</q> Then further on he adds: <q>As, then, the
child which has not sinned before, nor actually committed
sin, but has in itself that which committed sin, when subjected
<pb n='085'/><anchor id='Pg085'/>
to suffering is benefited, reaping the advantage of
many difficulties; so, also, although a perfect man may not
have sinned in act, and yet endures afflictions, he suffers
similarly with the child. Having within him the sinful principle,
but not embracing the opportunity of committing
sin, he does not sin; so that it is to be reckoned to him as
not having sinned. For as he who wishes to commit adultery
is an adulterer, although he fails to commit adultery, and he
who wishes to commit murder is a murderer, although he is
unable to kill; so, also, if I see the man without sin, whom I
refer to, suffering, though he have done nothing bad, I should
call him bad on account of the wish to sin. For I will affirm
anything rather than call Providence evil.</q> Then, in continuation,
he says expressly concerning the Lord, as concerning
man: <q>If, then, passing from all these observations, you were
to proceed to put me to shame by saying, perchance impersonating
certain parties, This man has then sinned, for this
man has suffered; if you permit, I will say, He has not
sinned, but was like a child suffering. If you insist more
urgently, I would say, That the man you name is man, but
God is righteous, <q>for no one is pure,</q> as one said, <q>from
pollution.</q></q> But the hypothesis of Basilides says that the
soul, having sinned before in another life, endures punishment
in this—the elect soul with honor by martyrdom, the
other purged by appropriate punishment.

<quote rend="display">
The system of Basilides, as presented by Irenæus, is dualistic and
emanationist; with it is to be compared the presentation of the system
by Hippolytus in his <hi rend='italic'>Philosophumena</hi>, where it appears as
evolutionary and pantheistic. The trend of present opinion appears
to be that the account given by Irenæus is more correct, or, at least, is
earlier. The following account has all the appearance of having been
taken from an original source (<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Hilgenfeld,
<hi rend='italic'>Ketzergeschichte</hi>, 195,
198). It represents the esoteric and more distinctively Gnostic teaching
of the school.
</quote>

<p>
Ch. 3. Basilides, to appear to have discovered something
more sublime and plausible, gives an immense development
<pb n='086'/><anchor id='Pg086'/>
to his doctrine. He declares that in the beginning the Nous
was born of the unborn Father, that from him in turn was
born the Logos, then from the Logos the Phronesis, from the
Phronesis Sophia and Dynamis, and from Dynamis and
Sophia the powers and principalities and angels, whom he
calls the first; and that by these the first heaven was made.
Then by emanation from these others were formed, and these
created another heaven similar to the first. And in like
manner, when still others had been formed by emanations
from these, corresponding to those who were over them, they
framed another third heaven; and from this third heaven
downward there was a fourth succession of descendants; and
so on, in the same manner, they say that other and still other
princes and angels were formed, and three hundred and sixty-five
heavens. Wherefore the year contained the same number
of days in conformity with the number of the heavens.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 4. The angels occupying the lowest heaven, that,
namely, which is visible to us, created all those things which
are in the world, and made allotments among themselves of
the earth, and of those nations which are upon it. The chief
of them is he who is thought to be the God of the Jews.
Inasmuch as he wished to make the other nations subject to
his own people, the Jews, all the other princes resisted and
opposed him. Wherefore all other nations were hostile to
his nation. But the unbegotten and nameless Father, seeing
their ruin, sent his own first-begotten Nous, for he it is
who is called Christ, to set free from the power of those who
made the world them that believe in him. He therefore
appeared on earth as a man to the nations of those powers
and wrought miracles. Wherefore he did not himself suffer
death, but Simon, a certain Cyrenian, was compelled and
bore the cross in his stead; and this latter was transfigured
by him that he might be thought to be Jesus and was crucified
through ignorance and error; but Jesus himself took the form
of Simon and stood by and derided him. For as he is an
incorporeal power and the Nous of the unborn Father, he
<pb n='087'/><anchor id='Pg087'/>
transfigured himself at pleasure, and so ascended to him who
had sent him, deriding them, inasmuch as he could not be
held, and was invisible to all. Those, then, who know these
things have been freed from the princes who made the world;
so that it is not necessary to confess him who was crucified,
but him who came in the form of a man, and was thought
to have been crucified, and was called Jesus, and was sent
by the Father, that by this dispensation he might destroy
the works of the makers of the world. Therefore, Basilides
says that if any one confesses the crucified, he is still a slave,
under the power of those who made our bodies; but whoever
denies him has been freed from these beings and is acquainted
with the dispensation of the unknown Father.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 5. Salvation is only of the soul, for the body is by
nature corruptible. He says, also, that even the prophecies
were derived from those princes who made the world, but
the law was especially given by their chief, who led the people
out of the land of Egypt. He attaches no importance to
meats offered to idols, thinks them of no consequence, but
makes use of them without hesitation. He holds, also, the
use of other things as indifferent, and also every kind of lust.
These men, furthermore, use magic, images, incantations,
invocations, and every other kind of curious arts. Coining
also certain names as if they were those of the angels, they
assert that some of these belong to the first, others to the
second, heaven; and then they strive to set forth the names,
principles, angels, powers, of the three hundred and sixty-five
imagined heavens. They also affirm that the name in which
the Saviour ascended and descended is Caulacau.<note place="foot">A mystic name; it is
the Hebrew for <q>line upon line,</q> see Is. 28:10. It
means norm or rule.</note>
</p>

<p>
Ch. 6. He, then, who has learned these things, and known
all the angels and their causes, is rendered invisible and
incomprehensible to the angels and powers, even as Caulacau
also was. And as the Son was unknown to all, so must they
also be known by no one; but while they know all and pass
<pb n='088'/><anchor id='Pg088'/>
through all, they themselves remain invisible and unknown
to all; for <q>Do thou,</q> they say, <q>know all, but let nobody
know thee.</q> For this reason, persons of such a persuasion
are also ready to recant, yea, rather, it is impossible that they
should suffer on account of a mere name, since they are alike
to all. The multitude, however, cannot understand these
matters, but only one out of a thousand, or two out of ten
thousand. They declare that they are no longer Jews, and
that they are not yet Christians; and that it is not at all
fitting to speak openly of their mysteries, but right to keep
them secret by preserving silence.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 7. They make out the local position of the three hundred
and sixty-five heavens in the same way as do the mathematicians.
For, accepting the theorems of the latter, they
have transferred them to their own style of doctrine. They
hold that their chief is Abraxas [or Abrasax]; and on this
account that the word contains in itself the numbers amounting
to three hundred and sixty-five.
</p>

<div>
<head>B. The School of Valentinus</head>

<p>
The Valentinians were the most important of all the Gnostics
closely connected with the Church. The school had many
adherents scattered throughout the Roman Empire, its leading
teachers were men of culture and literary ability, and the
sect maintained itself a long time. Valentinus himself was
a native of Egypt, and probably educated at Alexandria,
where he may have come under the influence of Basilides.
He taught his own system chiefly at Rome c. 140-c. 160.
The great work of Irenæus against the Gnostics, although
having all Gnostics in view, especially deals with the Valentinians
in their various forms, because Irenæus was of the
opinion that he who refutes their system refutes all (<hi rend='italic'>cf. Adv.
Hær.</hi>, IV, <hi rend='italic'>præf.</hi>, 2). It is difficult to reconstruct
with certainty the esoteric system of Valentinus as distinguished from
possibly later developments of the school, as Irenæus, the
principal authority, follows not only Valentinus, but Ptolomæus
<pb n='089'/><anchor id='Pg089'/>
and others, in describing the system. The following
selection of sources gives fragments of the letters and other
writings of Valentinus himself as preserved by Clement of
Alexandria, passages from Irenæus bringing out distinctive
features of the system, and the important letter of Ptolemæus
to Flora, one of the very few extant writings of the Gnostics
of an early date. It gives a good idea of the character of
the exoteric teaching of the school.

and that this different
race has come hither to us from above for the abolition of
death, and that the origin of death is the work of the Creator
<pb n='090'/><anchor id='Pg090'/>
of the world. Wherefore, also, he thus expounds that Scripture,
<q>No one shall see the face of God and live</q> [Ex. 33:20],
as if He were the cause of death. Respecting this God, he
makes those allusions, when writing, in these expressions: <q>As
much as the image is inferior to the living face, so much is the
world inferior to the living Eon. What is, then, the cause of
the image? It is the majesty of the face, which exhibits the
figure to the painter, to be honored by his name; for the
form is not found exactly to the life, but the name supplies
what is wanting in that which is formed. The invisibility
of God co-operates also for the sake of the faith of that which
has been fashioned.</q> For the Demiurge, called God and Father,
he designated the image and prophet of the true God,
as the Painter, and Wisdom, whose image, which is formed,
is to the glory of the invisible One; since the things which
proceed from a pair [syzygy] are complements [<hi rend='italic'>pleromata</hi>],
and those which proceed from one are images. But since what
is seen is no part of Him, the soul [<hi rend='italic'>psyche</hi>] comes from what
is intermediate, and is different; and this is the inspiration
of the different spirit. And generally what is breathed into
the soul, which is the image of the spirit [<hi rend='italic'>pneuma</hi>], and in
general, what is said of the Demiurge, who was made according
to the image, they say was foretold by a sensible image
in the book of Genesis respecting the origin of man; and the
likeness they transfer to themselves, teaching that the addition
of the different spirit was made, unknown to the Demiurge.

natures of spirits grow onto them, like that of the wolf, the
ape, the lion, and the goat, whose properties, showing themselves around
the soul, they say, assimilate the lusts of the soul to the likeness
of these animals.</q> See the whole passage immediately preceding

Valentinus, too, in a letter to certain people, writes in these
very words respecting the appendages: <q>There is One good,
by whose presence is the manifestation, which is by the Son,
and by Him alone can the heart become pure, by the expulsion
of every evil spirit from the heart; for the multitude of
spirits dwelling in it do not suffer it to be pure; but each of
them performs his own deeds, insulting it oft with unseemly
lusts. And the heart seems to be treated somewhat like a
caravansary. For the latter has holes and ruts made in it,
and is often filled with filthy dung; men living filthily in it,
and taking no care for the place as belonging to others. So
fares it with the heart as long as there is no thought taken
for it, being unclean and the abode of demons many. But
when the only good Father visits it, it is sanctified and gleams
with light. And he who possesses such a heart is so blessed
that he shall see God.</q>

<p>
Here the followers of Basilides, interpreting this expression
[Prov. 1:7] say that <q>the Archon, having heard the speech

amazement both with the voice and the vision, having had
glad tidings beyond his hopes announced to him; and that
his amazement was called fear, which became the origin of
wisdom, which distinguishes classes, and discriminates, and
perfects, and restores. For not the world alone, but also
the election, He that is over all has set apart and sent forth.</q>

<p>
And Valentinus appears also in an epistle to have adopted
such views. For he writes in these very words: <q>And as
terror fell on the angels at this creature, because he uttered
things greater than proceeds from his formation, by reason

of the supernal essence, and who spoke with free utterance;
so, also, among the tribes of men in the world the works of
men became terrors to those who made them—as, for example,
images and statues. And the hands of all fashion things
to bear the image of God; for Adam, formed into the name of
man, inspired the dread attaching to the pre-existing man, as
having his being in him; and they were terror-stricken and

The division of mankind into three classes, according to their nature

the hylics. Valentinus avails himself of the notion of the trichotomy of

The material goes to destruction. The animal, if it chooses

it chooses the worse, it, too, goes to the same [destruction].

are they also that are earthy</q> [I Cor. 15:48]; and in another

They [the Valentinians] say that in the invisible and ineffable
heights above there exists a certain perfect, pre-existent
Eon, and him they call Proarche, Propator, and Bythos;
and that he is invisible and that nothing is able to comprehend
him. Since he is comprehended by no one, and is invisible,
eternal, and unbegotten, he was in silence and profound quiescence
in the boundless ages. There existed along with him
Ennœa, whom they call Charis and Sige. And at a certain
time this Bythos determined to send forth from himself the
beginnings of all things, and just as seed he wished to send
forth this emanation, and he deposited it in the womb of her
who was with him, even of Sige. She then received this seed,
and becoming pregnant, generated Nous, who was both
similar and equal to him who had sent him forth<note place="foot">The term used for
a sending forth is προβολή or emanation, and is constantly
used in Gnosticism; hence the objection on the part of the majority

comprehended his father's greatness. This Nous they also
call Monogenes and Father and the Beginning of all Things.
Along with him was also sent forth Aletheia; and these
four constituted the first and first-begotten Pythagorean
Tetrad, which also they denominate the root of all things.
For there are first Bythos and Sige, and then Nous and
Aletheia. And Monogenes, when he perceived for what
purpose he had been sent forth, also himself sent forth
Logos and Zoe, being the father of all those who are to come
after him, and the beginning and fashioning of the entire

Anthropos and Ecclesia, and thus were formed the first-begotten
Ogdoad, the root and substance of all things, called
among them by four names; namely, Bythos, Nous, Logos,

feminine, as follows: Propator was united by a conjunction

Ptolemæus was possibly the most important disciple of Valentinus.
and the one to whom Irenæus is most indebted for his first-hand knowledge
of the teaching of the sect of the Valentinians. Of his writings
have been preserved, in addition to numerous brief fragments, a connected
passage of some length, apparently from a commentary on the
Prologue or the Gospel of St. John (see Irenæus, <hi rend='italic'>Adv. Hær.</hi>, I,

<p>
That many have not<note place="foot">This negative seems to spoil the sense of the
passage, and is omitted in some editions.</note> received the Law given by Moses,
my dear sister Flora, without recognizing either its fundamental
ideas or its precepts, will be perfectly clear to you,
I believe, if you become acquainted with the different views
regarding the same. For some [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the Church] say that
it was commanded by God and the Father; but others [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>,
the Marcionites], taking the opposite direction, affirm that
it was commanded by an opposing and injurious devil, and
they attribute to him the creation of the world, and say
that he is the Father and Creator. But such as teach such
doctrine are altogether deceived, and each of them strays
from the truth of what lies before him. For it appears not
to have been given by the perfect God and Father, because
it is itself imperfect, and it needs to be completed [<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Matt.
5:17], and it has precepts not consonant with the nature and
mind of God; neither is the Law to be attributed to the wickedness
<pb n='096'/><anchor id='Pg096'/>
of the adversary, whose characteristic is to do wrong.
Such do not know what was spoken by the Saviour, that a
city or a house divided against itself cannot stand, as our
Saviour has shown us. And besides, the Apostle says that
the creation of the world was His work (all things were made
by Him and without Him nothing was made), refuting the unsubstantial
wisdom of lying men, the work not of a god working
ruin, but a just one who hates wickedness. This is the
opinion of rash men who do not understand the cause of the
providence of the Creator [Demiurge] and have lost the eyes
not only of their soul, but of their body. How far, therefore,
such wander from the way of truth is evident to you from
what has been said. But each of these is induced by something
peculiar to himself to think thus, some by ignorance
of the God of righteousness: others by ignorance of the Father
of all, whom the Only One who knew Him alone revealed when
He came. To us it has been reserved to be deemed worthy
of making manifest to you the ideas of both of these, and to
investigate carefully this Law, whence anything is, and the
law-giver by whom it was commanded, bringing proofs of
what shall be said from the words of our Saviour, by which
alone one can be led without error to the knowledge of things.
</p>

<p>
First of all, it is to be known that the entire Law contained
in the Pentateuch of Moses was not given by one—I mean not
by God alone; but some of its precepts were given by men,
and the words of the Saviour teach us to divide it into three
parts. For He attributes some of it to God himself and His
law-giving, and some to Moses, not in the sense that God
gave laws through him, but in the sense that Moses, impelled
by his own spirit, set down some things as laws; and He
attributes some things to the elders of the people, who first
discovered certain commandments of their own and then
inserted them. How this was so you clearly learn from the
words of the Saviour. Somewhere the Saviour was conversing
with the people, who disputed with Him about divorce,
that it was allowed in the Law, and He said to them: Moses,
<pb n='097'/><anchor id='Pg097'/>
on account of the hardness of your hearts, permitted a man to
divorce his wife; but from the beginning it was not so. For
God, said He, joined this bond, and what the Lord joined
together let not man, He said, put asunder. He therefore
pointed out one law that forbids a woman to be separated
from her husband, which was of God, and another, which was
of Moses, that allows, on account of the hardness of men's
hearts, the bond to be dissolved. And accordingly, Moses gives
a law opposed to God, for it is opposed to the law forbidding
divorce. But if we consider carefully the mind of Moses,
according to which he thus legislated, we shall find that he
did not do this of his own mere choice, but by constraint
because of the weakness of those to whom he was giving the
law. For since they were not able to observe that precept
of God by which it was not permitted them to cast forth
their wives, with whom some of them lived unhappily, and
because of this they were in danger of falling still more into
unrighteousness, and from that into utter ruin, Moses,
intending to avoid this unhappy result, because they were
in danger of ruin, gave a certain second law, according to
circumstances less evil, in place of the better; and by his own
authority gave the law of divorce to them, that if they could
not keep that they might keep this, and should not fall into
unrighteousness and wickedness by which complete ruin
should overtake them. This was his purpose in as far as he
is found giving laws contrary to God. That thus the law
of Moses is shown to be other than the Law of God is indisputable,
if we have shown it in one instance.
</p>

<p>
And as to there being certain traditions of the elders which
have been incorporated in the Law, the Saviour shows this also.
For God, said He, commanded: Honor thy father and thy
mother, that it may be well with thee. But ye, He said,
addressing the elders, have said: It is a gift to God, that by
which ye might be profited by me, and ye annul the law of
God by the traditions of your elders. And this very thing
Isaiah declared when he said: This people honor me with
<pb n='098'/><anchor id='Pg098'/>
their lips, but their heart is far from me, vainly do they worship
me, teaching the doctrines and commandment of men [<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi>
Matt. 15:4-9.] Clearly, then, from these things it is shown
that this whole Law is to be divided into three parts. And in
it we find laws given by Moses, by the elders, and by God;
and this division of the whole Law as we have made it, has
shown the real truth as to the Law.
</p>

<p>
But one portion of the Law, that which is from God, is
again to be divided into three parts: first, into the genuine
precepts, quite untainted with evil, which is properly called
the law, and which the Saviour came not to destroy but to complete
(for what he completed was not alien to Him, but yet it
was not perfect); secondly, the part comprising evil and unrighteous
things, which the Saviour did away with as something
unfitting His nature; and thirdly, the part which is for
types and symbols, which is given as a law, as images of things
spiritual and excellent which, from being evident and manifest
to the senses, the Saviour changed into the spiritual and
unseen. Now the law of God, pure and untainted with
anything base, is the Decalogue itself, or those ten precepts
distributed in two tables, for the prohibition of things to be
avoided and the performance of things to be done. Although
they constitute a pure body of laws, yet they are not perfect,
but need to be completed by the Saviour. But there is that
body of commands which are tainted with unrighteousness;
such is the law requiring vengeance and requital of injuries
upon those who have first injured us, commanding the smiting
out of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth and revenging
bloodshed with bloodshed. For one who is second in doing
unrighteousness acts no less unrighteously, when the difference
is only one of order, doing the self-same work. But
such a precept was, and is, in other respects just, because of
the infirmity of those to whom the law was given, and it
was given in violation of the pure law, and was not consonant
with the nature and goodness of the Father of all; it was to
a degree appropriate, but yet given under a certain compulsion.
<pb n='099'/><anchor id='Pg099'/>
For he who forbids the commission of a single murder
in that he says, Thou shalt not kill, but commands that he
who kills shall in requital be killed, gives a second law and
commands a second slaying, when he has forbidden one, and
has been compelled to do this by necessity. And therefore
the Son, sent by Him, abolishes this portion of the Law, He
himself confessing that it is from God, and this, among other
things, is to be attributed to an ancient heresy, among which,
also, is that God, speaking, says: He that curseth father or
mother, let him die the death. But there is that part of the
Law which is typical, laying down that which is an image of
things spiritual and excellent, which gives laws concerning
such matters as offerings, I mean, and circumcision, the Sabbath
and fasting, the passover and the unleavened bread, and
such like. For all these things, being images and symbols of
the truth which had been manifested, have been changed.
They were abrogated so far as they were external, visible acts
of bodily performance, but they were retained so far as they
were spiritual, the names remaining, but the things being
changed. For the Saviour commands us to present offerings,
though not of irrational animals or of incense, but spiritual
offerings—praise, glory, and thanksgiving, and also liberality
and good deeds toward the neighbor. He would have us
circumcised with a circumcision not of the flesh, but spiritual
and of the heart; and have us observe the Sabbath, for he
wishes us to rest from wicked actions; and fast, but he does
not wish us to observe a bodily fast, but a spiritual, in that
we abstain from all that is unworthy. External fasting, however,
is observed among our people, since it is capable of
benefiting the soul to some degree, if it is practised with
reason, when it is neither performed from imitation of any
one, nor by custom, nor on account of a day, as if a day were
set apart for that purpose; and at the same time it is also
for a reminder of true fasting, that they who are not able
to fast thus may have a reminder of it from the fast which is
external. And that the passover, in the same way, and the
<pb n='100'/><anchor id='Pg100'/>
unleavened bread are images, the Apostle Paul also makes
clear, saying: Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us, and
That ye may be unleavened, not having any leaven (for he
calls leaven wickedness), but that ye may be a new dough.
</p>

<p>
This entire Law, therefore, acknowledged to be from God,
is divided into three parts: into that part which is fulfilled
by the Saviour, such as Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not
commit adultery, thou shalt not forswear thyself, for they
are included in this, thou shalt not be angry, thou shalt not
lust, thou shalt not swear; into that which is completely
abolished, such as an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,
being tainted with unrighteousness, and having the same
work of unrighteousness, and these are taken away by the
Saviour because contradictory (for those things which are contradictory
are mutually destructive), <q>For I say unto you
that ye in no wise resist evil, but if any one smite thee turn
to him the other cheek also;</q> and into that part which is
changed and converted from that which is bodily into that
which is spiritual, as he expounds allegorically a symbol which
is commanded as an image of things that are excellent. For
these images and symbols, fitted to represent other things,
were good so long as the truth was not yet present; but when
the truth is present, it is necessary to do the things of truth,
not the image of truth. The same thing his disciples and the
Apostle Paul teach, inasmuch as in regard to things which are
images, as we have already said, they show by the passover
and the unleavened bread that they are for our sake, but in
regard to the law which is tainted with unrighteousness, they
call it the law of commandments and ordinances, that is
done away; but as to the law which is untainted with evil,
he says that the law is holy and the commandment holy and
just and good.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, I think that it has been sufficiently shown you,
so far as it is possible to discuss the matter briefly, that there
are laws of men which have slipped in, and there is the very
Law of God which is divided into three parts. There remains,
<pb n='101'/><anchor id='Pg101'/>
therefore, for us to show, who, then, is that God who gave the
Law. But I think that this has been shown you in what
has already been said, if you have listened attentively. For
if the Law was not given by the perfect God, as we have shown,
nor by the devil, which idea merely to mention is unlawful,
there is another beside these, one who gave the Law. This
one is, therefore, the Demiurge and maker of this whole
world and of all things in it, different from the nature of the
other two, and placed between them, and who therefore
rightly bears the name of the Midst. And if the perfect God
is good according to His own nature, as also He is (for that
there is only One who is good, namely, God and His Father,
the Saviour asserted, the God whom He manifested), there is
also one who is of the nature of the adversary, bad and
wicked and characterized by unrighteousness. Standing,
therefore, between these, and being neither good nor bad nor
unjust, he can be called righteous in a sense proper to him,
as the judge of the righteousness that corresponds to him,
and that god will be lower than the perfect God, and his
righteousness lower than His, because he is begotten and not
unbegotten. For there is one unbegotten One, the Father,
from whom are all things, for all things have been prepared
by Him. But He is greater and superior to the adversary, and
is of a different essence or nature from the essence of the other.
For the essence of the adversary is corruption and darkness,
for he is hylic and composite,<note place="foot">Simplicity is always regarded
in ancient thought as a characteristic of Deity.</note>
but the essence of the unbegotten Father of all is incorruptibility, and He is light
itself, simple and uniform. But the essence of these<note place="foot">According to
another reading, of this one.</note> brings
forth a certain twofold power, and he is the image of the better.
Do not let these things disturb you, who wish to learn how
from one principle of all things, whom we acknowledge and
in whom be believe, namely, the unbegotten and the incorruptible
and the good, there exist two other natures, namely,
that of corruption and that of the Midst, which are not of
<pb n='102'/><anchor id='Pg102'/>
the same essence [ἀνομοοῦσιοι], though the good by nature
begets and brings forth what is like itself, and of the same
essence [ὁμοοῦσιος]. For you will learn by God's permission,
in due order, both the beginning of this and its generation,
since you are deemed worthy of the apostolic tradition,
which by a succession we have received, and in due season to
test all things by the teaching of the Saviour. The things which
in a few words I have said to you, my sister Flora, I have not
exhausted, and I have written briefly. At the same time I
have sufficiently explained to you the subject proposed, and
what I have said will be constantly of use to you, if as a beautiful
and good field you have received the seed and will by
it produce fruit.

<head>§ 23. Marcion</head>

<p>
Recently Marcion has been commonly treated apart from
the Gnostics on account of the large use he made of the
Pauline writings. By some he has even been regarded as a
champion of Pauline ideas which had failed to hold a place
in Christian thought. This opinion of Marcion is being
modified under the influence of a larger knowledge of Gnosticism.
At the bottom Marcion's doctrine was thoroughly
Gnostic, though he differed from the vast majority of Gnostics
in that his interest seems to have been primarily ethical rather
than speculative. His school maintained itself for some
centuries after undergoing some minor modifications. Marcion
was teaching at Rome, A. D. 140. The aspersions upon
his moral character must be taken with caution, as it had
already become a common practice to blacken the character
of theological opponents, regardless of the truth, a custom
which has not yet wholly disappeared.

<p>
Ch. 1. A certain Cerdo, who had taken his fundamental
ideas from those who were with Simon [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, Simon Magus],
and who was in Rome in the time of Hyginus, who held the
ninth place from the Apostles in the episcopal succession,
taught that the God who was preached by the law and the
prophets is not the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. For the
former is known, but the latter is unknown; and the former
is righteous, but the other is good.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 2. And Marcion of Pontus succeeded him and developed
a school, blaspheming shamelessly Him who is proclaimed
as God by the law and the prophets; saying that He is maker
of evils and a lover of wars, inconstant in purpose and inconsistent
with Himself. He said, however, that Jesus came from
the Father, who is above the God who made the world,
into Judea in the time of Pontius Pilate, the procurator of
Tiberius Cæsar, and was manifested in the form of a man to
those who were in Judea, destroying the prophets and the
law, and all the works of that God who made the world and
whom he also called Cosmocrator. In addition to this, he
mutilated the Gospel which is according to Luke, and removed
all that refers to the generation of the Lord, removing also
many things from the teaching in the Lord's discourses, in
which the Lord is recorded as very plainly confessing that
the founder of this universe is His Father; and thus Marcion
persuaded his disciples that he himself is truer than the
Apostles who delivered the Gospel; delivering to them not
the Gospel but a part of the Gospel. But in the same manner
he also mutilated the epistles of the Apostle Paul, removing
all that is plainly said by the Apostle concerning that God
who made the world, to the effect that He is the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and all that the Apostle taught by quotation
from the prophetical writings which foretold the coming
of the Lord.

<quote rend="display">
Tertullian's great work against Marcion is his most important and
most carefully written polemical treatise. He revised it three times.
The first book of the present revision dates from A. D. 207; the other
books cannot be dated except conjecturally. In spite of the openly

<p>
I, 19. Marcion's special and principal work is the separation
of the law and the Gospel; and his disciples will not be
able to deny that in this they have their best means by
which they are initiated into, and confirmed in, this heresy.
For these are Marcion's antitheses—that is, contradictory
propositions; and they aim at putting the Gospel at variance
with the law, that from the diversity of the statements of
the two documents they may argue for a diversity of gods, also.
</p>

<p>
IV, 2. With Marcion the mystery of the Christian religion
dates from the discipleship of Luke. Since, however, it
was under way previously, it must have had its authentic
materials by means of which it found its way down to Luke;
and by aid of the testimony which it bore Luke himself
becomes admissible.
</p>

<p>
IV, 3. Well, but because Marcion finds the Epistle to the
Galatians by Paul, who rebukes even Apostles for <q>not walking
uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel</q> [Gal. 2:14],
as well as accuses certain false apostles of being perverters
of the Gospel of Christ, he attempts to destroy the standing
of those gospels which are published as genuine and under
the names of Apostles, or of apostolic men, to secure, forsooth,
for his own gospel the credit he takes away from them.

At this time Rhodon, a native of Asia, who, as he himself

Marcion which, he says, was in his time divided into various

and refutes carefully the falsehood devised by each. But hear
what he writes: <q>Therefore also they have fallen into disagreement
among themselves, and maintain inconsistent
opinions. For Apelles, one of their herd, priding himself on
his manner of life and his age, acknowledged one principle
[<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, source of existence], but says that the prophecies were
from an opposing spirit. And he was persuaded of the truth
of this by the responses of a demoniac maiden named Philumene.
But others hold to two principles, as does the mariner
Marcion himself, among these are Potitus and Basiliscus.
These, following the wolf of Pontus and, like him,
unable to discover the divisions of things, became reckless,
and without any proof baldly asserted two principles. Again,
others of them drifted into worse error and assumed not only
two, but three, natures. Of these Syneros is the leader

<head>§ 24. Encratites</head>

<p>
Asceticism is a wide-spread phenomenon in nearly all religions.
It is to be found in apostolic Christianity. In the early
Church it was regarded as a matter in the option of the Christian
who was aiming at the religious life [see above, <ref target="Section_16">§ 16</ref>].
The characteristic of the Encratites was their insistence upon
asceticism as essential to Christian living. They were therefore
associated, and with abundant historical justification,
with Gnosticism.

<p>
Many offshoots of numerous heresies have already been
formed from those heresies which we have described.…
By way of example, let us say there are those springing from
Saturninus and Marcion, who are called Encratites [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>,
self-controlled], who preached the unmarried state, thus setting
aside the original creation of God, and indirectly condemning
Him who made male and female for the propagation of
the human race. Some of those reckoned as belonging to
them have also introduced abstinence from animal food, being
ungrateful to God who created all things. They deny, also,
the salvation of him who was first created. It is but recently
that this opinion has been discovered among them, since a
certain man named Tatian first introduced the blasphemy.
He had been a hearer of Justin's, and as long as he continued
with him he expressed no such views; but after his martyrdom
[circa A. D. 165] he separated from the Church, and
having become excited and puffed up by the thought of being
a teacher, as if he were superior to others, he composed his
own peculiar type of doctrine. He invented a system of
certain invisible Eons, like the followers of Valentinus; and
like Marcion and Saturninus, he declared that marriage was
nothing else than corruption and fornication. But this
denial of Adam's salvation was an opinion due entirely to
himself.

It even seemed to many serious persons to be nothing more
than a praiseworthy attempt to revive or retain certain
primitive Christian conditions, both in respect to personal
morals and ecclesiastical organization and life. In this way
it came to be patronized by not a few (<hi rend='italic'>e.g.</hi>, Tertullian) who,

There is said to be a certain village named Ardabau, in

Gratus was proconsul of Asia, a recent convert, Montanus
by name—who, in his boundless desire for leadership, gave
the adversary opportunity against him—first became inspired;
and falling into a sort of frenzy and ecstasy raved and began
to babble and utter strange sounds, prophesying in a
manner contrary to the traditional and constant custom of
the Church from the beginning.… And he stirred up,
besides, two women [Maximilla and Priscilla], and filled them
with the false spirit, so that they talked frantically, at unseasonable
times, and in a strange manner, like the person
already mentioned.… And the arrogant spirit taught them
to revile the universal and entire Church under heaven, because
the spirit of false prophecy received from it neither
honor nor entrance into it; for the faithful in Asia met often
and in many places throughout Asia to consider this matter
and to examine the recent utterances, and they pronounced

But there are others who are themselves in nature more

Spirit dwelt; and they likewise glorify one Montanus before
these women as a prophet. So, having endless books of these
people, they go astray, and they neither judge their statements
by reason nor pay attention to those who are able to judge.
But they behave without judgment in the faith they place
in them, saying they have learned something more through
them than from the law and the prophets and the Gospels.
But they glorify these women above the Apostles and every
gift, so that some of them presume to say that there was
something more in them than in Christ. These confess God

<head>Chapter III. The Defence Against Heresy</head>

<p>
The Church first met the various dangerous heresies which
distracted it in the second century by councils or gatherings
of bishops (<ref target="Section_26">§ 26</ref>). Although it
was not difficult to bring about
a condemnation of novel and manifestly erroneous doctrine,
there was need of fixed norms and definite authorities to which
to appeal. This was found in the apostolic tradition, which
could be more clearly determined by reference to the continuity
of the apostolic office, or the episcopate, and especially to
the succession of bishops in the churches founded by Apostles
(<ref target="Section_27">§ 27</ref>), the apostolic witness to the truth,
or the more precise determination of what writings should be regarded as apostolic,
or the canon of the New Testament (<ref target="Section_28">§ 28</ref>); and the
apostolic faith, which was regarded as summed up in the Apostles'
Creed (<ref target="Section_29">§ 29</ref>). These norms of orthodoxy seem to have been
generally established as authoritative somewhat earlier in the
West than in the East. The result was that Gnosticism was
rapidly expelled from the Church, though in some forms it lingered
for centuries (<ref target="Section_30">§ 30</ref>), and that the Church, becoming
organized around the episcopate, assumed by degrees a rigid
hierarchical constitution (<ref target="Section_31">§ 31</ref>).

<head>§ 26. The Beginnings of Councils as a Defence against Heresy</head>

<p>
Ecclesiastical councils were the first defence against heresy.
As the Church had not as yet attained its hierarchical constitution
and the autonomy of the local church still persisted,
these councils had little more than the combined authority
of the several members composing them. They had, as yet,
only moral force, and did not speak for the Church officially.
With the development of the episcopal constitution, the
councils gained rapidly in authority.

<head>§ 27. The Apostolic Tradition and the Episcopate</head>

<p>
The Gnostics claimed apostolic authority for their teaching
and appealed to successions of teachers who had handed
down their teachings. This procedure forced the Church to
lay stress upon the obvious fact that its doctrine was derived
from the Apostles, a matter on which it never had had any
doubt, but was vouched for, not by obscure teachers, but
by the churches which had been founded by the Apostles
themselves in large cities and by the bishops whom the Apostles
had instituted in those churches. Those churches,
furthermore, agreed among themselves, but the Gnostic
teachers differed widely. By this appeal the bishop came
to represent the apostolic order (for an earlier conception

Ch. 1. The tradition, therefore, of the Apostles, manifested
throughout the world, is a thing which all who wish to see
the facts can clearly perceive in every church; and we are
able to count up those who were appointed bishops by the
Apostles, and to show their successors to our own time, who
neither taught nor knew anything resembling these men's
ravings. For if the Apostles had known hidden mysteries
which they used to teach the perfect, apart from and without
the knowledge of the rest, they would have delivered them
especially to those to whom they were also committing the
churches themselves. For they desired them to be very perfect
and blameless in all things, and were also leaving them as
their successors, delivering over to them their own proper
place of teaching; for if these should act rightly great advantage
would result, but if they fell away the most disastrous
calamity would occur.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 2. But since it would be very long in such a volume
as this to count up the successions [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, series of bishops]
in all the churches, we confound all those who in any
way, whether through self-pleasing or vainglory, or through
blindness and evil opinion, gather together otherwise than
they ought, by pointing out the tradition derived from the
Apostles of the greatest, most ancient, and universally known
Church, founded and established by the two most glorious
Apostles, Peter and Paul, and also the faith declared to
<pb n='113'/><anchor id='Pg113'/>
men which through the succession of bishops comes down
to our times. For with this Church, on account of its more
powerful leadership [<hi rend='italic'>potiorem principalitatem</hi>], every church,
that is, the faithful, who are from everywhere, must needs
agree; since in it that tradition which is from the Apostles has
always been preserved by those who are from everywhere.

Ch. 3. The blessed Apostles having founded and established
the Church, intrusted the office of the episcopate to
Linus.<note place="foot">See this passage as quoted in Eusebius, <hi rend='italic'>Hist.

Paul speaks of this Linus in his Epistles to Timothy.
Anacletus succeeded him, and after Anacletus, in the
third place from the Apostles, Clement received the episcopate.
He had seen and conversed with the blessed Apostles,
and their preaching was still sounding in his ears and
their tradition was still before his eyes. Nor was he alone
in this, for many who had been taught by the Apostles yet
survived. In the times of Clement, a serious dissension having
arisen among the brethren in Corinth, the Church of
Rome sent a suitable letter to the Corinthians, reconciling
them in peace, renewing their faith, and proclaiming the doctrine
lately received from the Apostles.…
</p>

<p>
Evaristus succeeded Clement, and Alexander Evaristus.
Then Sixtus, the sixth from the Apostles, was appointed.
After him Telesephorus, who suffered martyrdom gloriously,
and then Hyginus; after him Pius, and after Pius Anicetus;
Soter succeeded Anicetus, and now, in the twelfth place from
the Apostles, Eleutherus [174-189] holds the office of bishop.
In the same order and succession the tradition and the
preaching of the truth which is from the Apostles have continued

<p>
Ch. 4. But Polycarp, too, was not only instructed by the
Apostles, and acquainted with many that had seen Christ,
but was also appointed by Apostles in Asia bishop of the
church in Smyrna, whom we, too, saw in our early youth
(for he lived a long time, and died, when a very old man, a
glorious and most illustrious martyr's death); he always
<pb n='114'/><anchor id='Pg114'/>
taught the things which he had learned from the Apostles,
which the Church also hands down, and which alone are
true. To these things all the Asiatic churches testify, as do
also those who, down to the present time, have succeeded
Polycarp, who was a much more trustworthy and certain
witness of the truth than Valentinus and Marcion and the
rest of the evil-minded. It was he who was also in Rome in
the time of Anicetus and caused many to turn away from the
above-mentioned heretics to the Church of God, proclaiming
that he had received from the Apostles this one and only
truth which has been transmitted by the Church. And there
are those who heard from him that John, the disciple of the
Lord, going to bathe in Ephesus, when he saw Cerinthus
within, ran out of the bath-house without bathing, crying:
<q>Let us flee, lest even the bath-house fall, because Cerinthus,
the enemy of the truth, is within.</q> And Polycarp himself,
when Marcion once met him and said, <q>Knowest thou us?</q>
replied, <q>I know the first-born of Satan.</q> Such caution did
the Apostles and their disciples exercise that they might not
even converse with any of those who perverted the truth;
as Paul, also, said: <q>A man that is a heretic after the first
and second admonition, reject; knowing that he that is such
subverteth and sinneth, being condemned by himself.</q> There
is also a very powerful Epistle of Polycarp written to the
Philippians, from which those who wish to, and who are concerned
for their own salvation, may learn the character of
his faith and the preaching of the truth.

Ch. 20. The Apostles founded in the several cities churches
from which the other churches have henceforth borrowed
the shoot of faith and seeds of teaching and do daily borrow
<pb n='115'/><anchor id='Pg115'/>
that they may become churches; and it is from this fact
that they also will be counted as apostolic, being the offspring
of apostolic churches. Every kind of thing must be judged
by reference to its origin. Therefore so many and so great
churches are all one, being from that first Church which is
from the Apostles. Thus they are all primitive and all
apostolic, since they altogether are approved by their unity,
and they have the communion of peace, the title of brotherhood,
and the interchange of hospitality, and they are governed
by no other rule than the single tradition of the same mystery.

<p>
Ch. 21. Here, then, we enter our demurrer, that if the Lord
Jesus Christ sent Apostles to preach, others than those whom
Christ appointed ought not to be received as preachers.
For no man knoweth the Father save the Son and he to whom
the Son has revealed Him [<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Luke 10:22]; nor does it appear
that the Son has revealed Him unto any others than the
Apostles, whom He sent forth to preach what, of course, He
had revealed to them. Now, what they should preach, that
is, what Christ revealed to them, can, as I must likewise
here enter as a demurrer, properly be proved in no other
way than by those very churches which the Apostles themselves
founded by preaching to them, both <hi rend='italic'>viva voce</hi>, as the
phrase is, and subsequently by epistles. If this is so, it is
evident that all doctrine which agrees with those apostolic
churches, the wombs and origins of the faith, must be reckoned
for truth, as undoubtedly containing what the churches
received from the Apostles, the Apostles from Christ, Christ
from God. There remains, therefore, for us to show whether
our doctrine, the rule of which we have given above [<hi rend='italic'>v. infra</hi>,
<ref target="Section_29_c">§ 29, <hi rend='italic'>c</hi></ref>], agrees with the
tradition of the Apostles, and likewise
whether the others come from deceit. We hold fast to the
apostolic churches, because in none is there a different doctrine;
this is the witness of the truth.

It should be noted that the appeal to apostolic churches is to any
and all such, and is accordingly just so much the stronger in the
<pb n='116'/><anchor id='Pg116'/>
controversy in which it was brought forward. The argument, whenever
it occurs, does not turn upon the infallibility of any one see or
church as such. That point is not touched. Such a turn to the
argument would have weakened the force of the appeal in the dispute
with the Gnostics, however powerfully it might be used in other
controversies.

<p>
Come, now, you who would indulge a better curiosity, if
you would apply it to the business of your salvation, run
over the apostolic churches, in which the very thrones of
the Apostles are still pre-eminent in their places, in which
their own authentic writings are read, uttering the voice and
representing the face of each of them severally. Achaia is
very near you, in which you find Corinth. Since you are
not far from Macedonia, you have Philippi; there, too,
you have the Thessalonians. Since you are able to cross
to Asia, you get Ephesus. Since, moreover, you are close
upon Italy, you have Rome, from which there comes even
into our own hands the very authority of Apostles themselves.
How happy is that church, on which Apostles poured forth
all their doctrine along with their blood! Where Peter
endures a passion like his Lord's; where Paul wins a crown
in a death like John's; where the Apostle John was first
plunged, unhurt, into boiling oil, and thence remitted to
his island exile! See what she has learned, what taught;
what fellowship she has had with even our churches in Africa!
One Lord God does she acknowledge, the Creator of the
universe, and Christ Jesus born of the Virgin Mary, the Son
of God the Creator; and the resurrection of the flesh; the
law and the prophets she unites in one volume with the
writings of Evangelists and Apostles, from which she drinks
in her faith. This she seals with the water of baptism, arrays
with the Holy Ghost, feeds with the eucharist, cheers with
martyrdom, and against such a discipline thus maintained
she admits no gainsayer.

<head>§ 28. The Canon or the Authoritative New Testament Writings</head>

<p>
The Gnostics used in support of their doctrines writings
which they attributed to the Apostles, thus having a direct
apostolic witness to these doctrines. This they did in imitation
of the Church's practice of using apostolic writings for
edification and instruction. Marcion drew up a list of books
which were alone to be regarded as authoritative among his
followers [<hi rend='italic'>v. supra</hi>, <ref target="Section_23_a">§ 23,
<hi rend='italic'>a</hi></ref>]. The point to be made by the
champions of the faith of the great body of Christians was
that only those books could be legitimately used in support
of Christian doctrine which could claim actual apostolic
origin and had been used continuously in the Church. As
a fact, the books to which they appealed had been in use
generation after generation, but the Gnostic works were
unknown until a comparatively recent time and were too
closely connected with only the founders of a sect to deserve
credence. It was a simple literary argument and appeal to
tangible evidence. The list of books regarded as authoritative
constituted the Canon of Scripture. The state of the Canon
in the second half of the second century, especially in the
West, is shown in the following extracts.

The earliest list of canonical books of the New Testament was
found by L. A. Muratori in 1740 in a MS. of the eighth century.
It lacks beginning and end. It belongs to the middle or the second
half of the second century. It cannot with certainty be attributed
to any known person. The obscure Latin text is probably a translation
from the Greek. The fragment begins with what appears to
be an account of St. Mark's Gospel.

<p>
… but at some he was present, and so he set them
down.
</p>

<p>
The third book of the gospels, that according to Luke.
Luke, the physician, compiled it in his own name in order,
when, after the ascension of Christ, Paul had taken him to
be with him like a student of law. Yet neither did he see the
Lord in the flesh; and he, too, as he was able to ascertain
events, so set them down. So he began his story from the
birth of John.
</p>

<p>
The fourth of the gospels is John's, one of the disciples.
When exhorted by his fellow-disciples and bishops, he said,
<q>Fast with me this day for three days; and what may be
revealed to any of us, let us relate to one another.</q> The
same night it was revealed to Andrew, one of the Apostles,
that John was to write all things in his own name, and they
were all to certify.
</p>

<p>
And therefore, though various elements are taught in the
several books of the gospels, yet it makes no difference
to the faith of the believers, since by one guiding Spirit all
things are declared in all of them concerning the nativity,
the passion, the resurrection, the conversation with His
disciples, and His two comings, the first in lowliness and
contempt, which has come to pass, the second glorious with
royal power, which is to come.
</p>

<p>
What marvel, therefore, if John so firmly sets forth each
statement in his epistles, too, saying of himself: <q>What we
have seen with our eyes and heard with our ears and our hands
have handled, these things we have written to you</q>? For
so he declares himself to be not an eye-witness and a hearer
only, but also a writer of all the marvels of the Lord in order.
</p>

<p>
The acts, however, of all the Apostles are written in one
book. Luke puts it shortly, <q>to the most excellent Theophilus,</q>
that the several things were done in his own presence,
as he also plainly shows by leaving out the passion of
Peter, and also the departure of Paul from the city [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>,
Rome] on his journey to Spain.
</p>

<pb n='119'/><anchor id='Pg119'/>

<p>
The epistles, however, of Paul make themselves plain to
those who wish to understand what epistles were sent by
him, and from what place and for what cause. He wrote
at some length, first of all, to the Corinthians, forbidding
schisms and heresies; next to the Galatians, forbidding circumcision;
then to the Romans, impressing on them the
plan of the Scriptures, and also that Christ is the first principle
of them, concerning which severally it is necessary for
us to discuss, since the blessed Apostle Paul himself, following
the order of his predecessor John, writes only by name to
seven churches in the following order: to the Corinthians a
first, to the Ephesians a second, to the Philippians a third,
to the Colossians a fourth, to the Galatians a fifth, to the
Thessalonians a sixth, to the Romans a seventh; and yet,
although for the sake of admonition there is a second to the
Corinthians and to the Thessalonians, but one Church is
recognized as being spread over the entire world. For John,
too, in the Apocalypse, though he writes to seven churches,
yet speaks to all. Howbeit to Philemon one, to Titus one,
and to Timothy two were put in writing from personal
inclination and attachment, to be in honor, however, with
the Catholic Church for the ordering of the ecclesiastical mode
of life. There is current, also, one to the Laodiceans, another
to the Alexandrians, [both] forged in Paul's name to suit a
heresy of Marcion, and several others, which cannot be
received into the Catholic Church; for it is not fitting that
gall be mixed with honey.
</p>

<p>
The Epistle of Jude, no doubt, and the couple bearing the
name of John are accepted in the Catholic [Church], and the
Wisdom written by the friends of Solomon in his honor.
The Apocalypse, also, of John and of Peter only we receive;
which some of us will not have read in the Church. But the
Shepherd was written quite lately in our times by Hermas,
while his brother Pius, the bishop, was sitting in the chair of
the church of the city of Rome; and therefore it ought to
be read, indeed, but it cannot to the end of time be publicly
<pb n='120'/><anchor id='Pg120'/>
read in the Church to the people, either among the prophets,
who are complete in number, or among the Apostles.
</p>

<p>
But of Valentinus, the Arsinoite, and his friends, we receive
nothing at all, who have also composed a long new
book of Psalms, together with Basilides and the Asiatic
founder of the Montanists.

(MSG, 7:885.)</head>

<quote rend="display">
The following extract illustrates the allegorical method of exegesis
in use throughout the Church, and also the opinion of the author
that there were but four gospels, and could be no more than four.
It should be noted that the symbolism of the beasts is not that which
has become current in ecclesiastical art.
</quote>

<p>
It is not possible that the gospels be either more or fewer
than they are. For since there are four regions of the world
in which we live, and four principal winds, and the Church
is scattered over the whole earth, and the pillar and ground
of the Church is the Gospel and the Spirit of Life, it is fitting
that she should have four pillars, breathing forth immortality
on every side, and giving life to men. From this it is evident
that the Word, the Artificer of all, who sitteth upon the
cherubim and who contains all things and was manifested
to men, has given us the Gospel under four forms, but bound
together by one Spirit. As also David says when he prayed
for His coming: <q>Thou that sittest between the cherubim,
shine forth</q> [<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Psalm 80:1]. For the cherubim, also, were
four-faced, and their faces were images of the dispensation
of the Son of God. For he says, <q>The first living creature
was like a lion</q> [<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Ezek. 1:5 <hi rend='italic'>ff.</hi>],
symbolizing His effectual
working, leadership, and royal power; the second was like
a calf, symbolizing His sacrificial and sacerdotal order; but
<q>the third had, as it were, the face of a man,</q> evidently
describing His coming as a human being; <q>the fourth was
like a flying eagle,</q> pointing out the gift of the Spirit hovering
over the Church. And therefore the gospels are in accord
with these things, among which Christ is seated. For that
according to John relates His original, effectual, and glorious
<pb n='121'/><anchor id='Pg121'/>
generation from the Father, thus declaring, <q>In the beginning
was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was
God</q> [<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> John 1:1 <hi rend='italic'>ff.</hi>], and
further, <q>All things were made
by Him and without Him was nothing made.</q> For this reason,
also, is that Gospel full of confidence, for such is His person.
But that according to Luke, which takes up His priestly character,
commenced with Zacharias, the priest, who offers
sacrifice to God. For now was made ready the fatted calf,
about to be immolated for the recovery of the younger son
[Luke 15:23]. Matthew, again, relates His generation as a
man, saying, <q>The book of the generation of Jesus Christ,
the son of David, the son of Abraham</q> [Matt. 1:1]; and
<q>The birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise</q> [Matt. 1:18].
This, then, is the gospel of His humanity; for which reason
the character of a humble and meek man is kept up through
the whole gospel. Mark, on the other hand, commences
with reference to the prophetical Spirit who comes down
from on high to men, saying, <q>The beginning of the Gospel
of Jesus Christ, as it is written in Isaiah the prophet,</q> pointing
to the winged aspect of the Gospel, and on this account he
makes a compendious and brief narrative, for such is the
prophetical character. And the Word of God himself had
intercourse with the patriarchs, before Moses, in accordance
with His divinity and glory; but for those under the Law He
instituted a sacerdotal and liturgical service. Afterward,
having been made man for us, He sent the gift of the heavenly
Spirit over all the earth, to protect it with His wings. Such,
then, was the course followed by the Son of God, and such,
also, were the forms of the living creatures; and such as was
the form of the living creatures, such, also, was the character
of the Gospel. For the living creatures are quadriform,
and the Gospel is quadriform, as is also the course followed
by our Lord. For this reason four principal covenants were
given mankind: one prior to the Deluge, under Adam; the
second after the Deluge, under Noah; the third was the
giving of the law under Moses; the fourth is that which
<pb n='122'/><anchor id='Pg122'/>
renovates man and sums up all things in itself by means of
the Gospel, raising and bearing men upon its wings into the
heavenly kingdom.

<quote rend="display">
Tertullian's work against Marcion belongs to the first decade of
the third century; see above, <ref target="Section_23_b">§ 23,
<hi rend='italic'>b</hi></ref>. In the following passage he combines
the argument from the apostolic churches with the authority
of the apostolic witness. This is the special importance of the reference
to the connection of St. Mark's Gospel with St. Peter, and is
an application of the principle that the authority of a book in the
Church rested upon its apostolic origin.
</quote>

<p>
If it is evidently true that what is earlier is more true,
that what is earlier is what is from the beginning, that what
is from the beginning is from the Apostles, it will be equally
evidently true that what is handed down from the Apostles
is what has been a sacred deposit in the churches of the
Apostles. Let us see what milk the Corinthians drank from
Paul; to what rule the Galatians were brought for correction;
what the Philippians, the Thessalonians, the Ephesians,
read; what the Romans near by also say, to whom Peter and
Paul bequeathed the Gospel even sealed with their own
blood. We have also John's nursling churches. For, although
Marcion rejects his Apocalypse, the order of bishops,
when traced to their origin, will rest on John as their author.
Likewise the noble lineage of the other churches is recognized.
I say, therefore, that in them, and not only in the apostolic
churches, but in all those which are united with them in
the fellowship of the mystery [<hi rend='italic'>sacramenti</hi>], that Gospel of
Luke, which we are defending with all our might [<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi>
<ref target="Section_23">§ 23</ref>],
has stood its ground from its very first publication; whereas
Marcion's gospel is not known to most people, and to none
whatever is it known without being condemned. Of course
it has its churches, but they are its own; they are as late as
they are spurious. Should you want to know their origins,
you will more easily discover apostasy in it than apostolicity,
with Marcion, forsooth, as their founder or some one of
<pb n='123'/><anchor id='Pg123'/>
Marcion's swarm. Even wasps make combs; so, also, these
Marcionites make churches. The same authority of the
apostolic churches will afford evidence to other gospels, also,
which we possess equally through their means and according
to their usage—I mean the Gospel of John and the Gospel
of Matthew, but that which Mark published may be affirmed
to be Peter's, whose interpreter Mark was. For even the
Digest of Luke men usually ascribe to Paul. And it may
well seem that the works which disciples publish belong to
their masters.

<head>§ 29. The Apostles' Creed</head>

<p>
By the middle of the second century there were current in
the Church brief confessions of faith which had already
been in use from a time in the remoter past as summaries
of the apostolic faith. They were naturally attributed to the
Apostles themselves, although they seem to have varied in
many details. They were used principally in baptism, and
were long kept secret from the catechumen until just before
that rite was administered. They are preserved only in paraphrase,
and can be reconstructed only by a careful comparison
of many texts.

all things were made, and without whom nothing was made.
This One was sent by the Father into the Virgin, and was

The internal crisis, or the conflict with heresy, led the

foundation was laid for such a development of the episcopate

existence of a wide-spread episcopal organization at an early date in
the second century. Possibly the connection of Irenæus with Asia
Minor, where the episcopal organization admittedly was earliest,
diminishes the force of the argument. The reference to the <q>charisma
of truth,</q> which the bishops were said to possess, was to furnish later
a theoretical basis for the authority of bishops assembled in council.

Ch. 2. Wherefore it is incumbent to obey the presbyters
who are in the Church, those who, as I have shown, possess
the succession from the Apostles; those who together with
the succession of the episcopate have received the certain
gift [charisma] of the truth according to the good pleasure
of the Father; but also to hold in suspicion others who
depart from the primitive succession and assemble themselves
together in any place whatsoever.…

Ch. 5. Such presbyters does the Church nourish, of whom
also the prophet says: <q>I will give thy rulers in peace, and
thy bishops in righteousness</q> [<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Is. 60:17]. Of whom
also the Lord did declare: <q>Who, then, shall be a faithful
steward, good and wise, whom the Lord sets over His household,
to give them their meat in due season? Blessed is that
servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing</q>
[Matt. 24:45 <hi rend='italic'>f.</hi>]. Paul, then, teaching us where one may
<pb n='129'/><anchor id='Pg129'/>
find such, says: <q>God hath placed in the Church, first, Apostles;
secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers</q> [I Cor. 12:28].
Where, then, the gifts of the Lord have been placed there we
are to learn the truth; namely, from those who possess the
succession of the Church from the Apostles, and among
whom exists that which is sound and blameless in conduct, as
well as that which is unadulterated and incorrupt in speech.

In Tertullian's statement as to the necessity of apostolic succession,
the language is more precise than in Irenæus's. Bishop and presbyter
are not used as interchangeable terms, as would appear in the passage
in Irenæus. The whole is given a more legal turn, as was in harmony
with the writer's legal mind.

<p>
But if there be any heresies bold enough to plant themselves
in the midst of the apostolic age, that they may thereby
seem to have been handed down from the Apostles, because
they were in the time of the Apostles, we can say: Let them
produce the originals of their churches; let them unfold the
roll of their bishops, running down in due succession from
the beginning in such manner that that first bishop of theirs
shall be able to show for his ordainer or predecessor some one
of the Apostles or of apostolic men—a man, moreover, who
continued steadfast with the Apostles. For in this manner
the apostolic churches transmit their registers; as the church
of Smyrna, which records that Polycarp was placed therein
by John; as also the church of Rome, which makes Clement
to have been ordained in like manner by Peter. In exactly
the same way the other churches likewise exhibit their several
worthies, whom, as having been appointed to their episcopal
places by the Apostles, they regard as transmitters of
the apostolic seed.

<head>Chapter IV. The Beginnings Of Catholic Theology</head>

<p>
The theology of the Church, as distinguished from the
current traditional theology, was the statement of the beliefs
commonly held by Christians but expressed in the more
<pb n='130'/><anchor id='Pg130'/>
precise and scientific language of current philosophy, the
co-ordination of those beliefs as so stated together with their
necessary consequences, and their proof by reference to
Holy Scripture and reason. In this attempt to build up a
body of reasoned religious ideas there were two lines of
thought or interpretation of the common Christianity already
distinguished by the middle of the second century, and destined
to hold a permanent place in the Church. These were
the apologetic conception of Christianity as primarily a
revealed philosophy (<ref target="Section_32">§ 32</ref>), and the so-called Asia Minor
school of theology, with its conception of Christianity as
primarily salvation from sin and corruptibility (<ref target="Section_33">§ 33</ref>). In
both lines of interpretation the Incarnation played an essential
part: in the apologetic as insuring the truth of the revealed
philosophy, in the Asia Minor theology as imparting
to corruptible man the divine incorruptibility.

<head>§ 32. The Apologetic Conception of Christianity</head>

<p>
Christianity was regarded as a revealed philosophy by
the apologists. This they considered under three principal
aspects: knowledge, or a revelation of the divine nature;
a new law, or a code of morals given by Christ; and life,
or future rewards for the observance of the new law that
had been given. The foundation of all was laid in the doctrine
of the Logos (<hi rend='italic'>A</hi>), which involved, as a consequence,
some theory of the relation of the resulting distinctions in
the divine nature to the primary conviction of the unity of
God, or some doctrine of the Trinity (<hi rend='italic'>B</hi>). As a result of the
new law given, moralism was inevitable, whereby a man by
his efforts earned everlasting life (<hi rend='italic'>C</hi>). The proof that Jesus
was the incarnate Logos was drawn from the fulfilment of
Hebrew prophecy (<hi rend='italic'>D</hi>). It should be remembered that the
apologists influenced later theology by their actual writings,
<pb n='131'/><anchor id='Pg131'/>
and not by unexpressed and undeveloped opinions which they
held as a part of the common tradition and the Christianity
of the Gentile Church. Whatever they might have held in
addition to their primary contentions had little or no effect,
however valuable it may be for modern students, and the
conviction that Christianity was essentially a revealed philosophy
became current, especially in the East, finding its
most powerful expression in the Alexandrian school. (<hi rend='italic'>V. infra</hi>,

<head>(A) The Logos Doctrine</head>

<p>
As stated by the apologists, the Logos doctrine not only
furnished a valuable line of defence for Christianity (<hi rend='italic'>v. supra</hi>,
<ref target="Section_20">§ 20</ref>), but also gave theologians a useful formula for
stating the relation of the divine element in Christ to God. That
divine element was the Divine Word or Reason (Logos).
It is characteristic of the doctrine of the Logos as held by the
early apologists that, although they make the Word, or
Logos, personal and distinguish Him from God the Father,
yet that Word does not become personally distinguished
from the source of His being until, and in connection with,
the creation of the world. Hence there arose the distinction
between the <foreign lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">Logos endiathetos</foreign>,
or as yet within the being of the Father, and the
<foreign lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">Logos prophorikos</foreign>,
or as proceeding forth and becoming a distinct person. Here is, at any rate, a
marked advance upon the speculation of Philo, by whom the
Logos is not regarded as distinctly personal.

Logos in Himself, being eternally reasonable [λογικός]), but inasmuch
as He came forth to be idea and energizing power of
all material things, which lay like a nature without attributes,
and an inactive earth, the grosser particles being mixed up
with the lighter. The prophetic Spirit also agrees with our
statements: <q>The Lord, it says, created me the beginning of

<head>§ 33. The Asia Minor Conception of Christianity</head>

<p>
The Asia Minor school regarded Christianity primarily
as redemption, salvation, the imparting of new power, life,
and incorruptibility by union with divinity in the Incarnation.
Its leading representative was Irenæus, a native of Asia
Minor, but many of his leading ideas had been anticipated
by Ignatius of Antioch, and they were shared by many others.
</p>

<pb n='136'/><anchor id='Pg136'/>

<p>
The theology of Irenæus influenced Tertullian to some extent,
but its essential points were reproduced by Athanasius,
who was directly indebted to Irenæus, and through
him it superseded in the Neo-Alexandrian school the tradition
derived through Origen and Clement from the apologists.
Characteristic features of the Asia Minor theology
are the place assigned to the Incarnation as itself effecting
redemption or salvation, the idea of recapitulation whereby
Christ becomes the head of a new race of redeemed men, a
second Adam, and of the eucharist as imparting the incorruptibility
of Christ's immortal flesh which is received by the
faithful.

In no other way could we have learned the things of God,
if our Master, existing previously as the Word, had not been
made man. For no one else could have declared to us the
truths of the Father than the Father's own Word. For
who else knew the mind of the Lord or who else has been
his counsellor? [Rom. 11:34]. Nor again in any other way
could we have learned except by seeing our Master with our
eyes and hearing His voice with our ears; that so as imitators
of His acts and doers of His words we might have fellowship
with Him and receive of the fulness of Him who is perfect
and who was before all creation. All this we have been made
in these latter days by Him who only is supremely good and
who has the gift of incorruptibility; inasmuch as we are
conformed to His likeness and predestinated to become what
we never were before, according to the foreknowledge of the
Father, made a first-fruit of His workmanship, we have,
therefore, received all this at the foreordained season, according
to the dispensation of the Word, who is perfect in all
things. For He, who is the mighty Word and very man,
redeeming us by His blood in a reasonable manner, gave
<pb n='137'/><anchor id='Pg137'/>
Himself as a ransom for those who had been led into captivity.
And since apostasy tyrannized over us unjustly, for
though by nature we were God's possession, it yet alienated
us contrary to nature, making us its own disciples, the Word
of God, powerful in all things and constant in His justice,
dealt justly even with apostasy itself, redeeming from it
what was His own property. Not by force, the way in which
the apostasy had originally gained its mastery over us,
greedily grasping at that which was not its own; but by
moral force [<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">secundum suadelam</foreign>]
as became God, by persuasion
and not by force, regaining what He wished; so that
justice might not be violated and God's ancient handiwork
might not perish. Therefore, since by His own blood the
Lord redeemed us and gave His soul for our soul, and His
flesh for our flesh, and shed on us His Father's spirit to unite
and join us in communion God and man, bringing God down
to men by the descent of the Spirit, and raising up man
to God by His incarnation, and by a firm and true promise
giving us at His advent incorruptibility by communion
with Him, and thus all the errors of the heretics are destroyed.

made a man liable to suffering, every objection is set aside of
those who say: <q>If Christ was born at that time, He did

Son of God did not then begin to be, since He existed with
His Father always; but when He was incarnate, and was

<p>
Ch. 7. He caused human nature to cleave to and to become
one with God, as we have said. For if man had not overcome
the adversary of man, the enemy would not have been
legitimately overcome. And again, if God had not given
salvation, we could not have had it securely. And if man
had not been united to God, he could never have become a
partaker of incorruptibility. For it was incumbent upon
the Mediator between God and man, by His relationship to
both, to bring about a friendship and concord, and to present
man to God and to reveal God to man. For in what way
could we be partakers of the adoption of sons, if we had not
received from Him, through the Son, that fellowship which
refers to Himself, if the Word, having been made flesh, had
not entered into communion with us? Wherefore He passed
also through every stage of life restoring to all communion

<head>Period IV. The Age Of The Consolidation Of The Church: 200 to 324 A. D.</head>

<p>
In the fourth period of the Church under the heathen
Empire, or the period of the consolidation of the Church,
the number of Christians increased so rapidly that the relation
of the Roman State to the Church became a matter of
the gravest importance (ch. 1). During a period of comparative
peace and prosperity the Church developed its
doctrinal system and its constitution (ch. 2). Although the
school of Asia Minor became isolated and temporarily ceased
to affect the bulk of the Church elsewhere, the school of the
apologists was brilliantly continued at Alexandria under
Clement and Origen, and later under Origen at Cæsarea
in Palestine. Meanwhile the foundations were laid in North
Africa for a distinctive type of Western theology, inaugurated
by Tertullian and developed by Cyprian. After years of
alternating favor and local persecutions, the first general
persecution (ch. 3) broke upon the Church, rudely testing
its organization and ultimately strengthening and furthering
its tendencies toward a strictly hierarchical constitution. In
the long period of peace that followed (ch. 4), the discussions
that had arisen within the Church as to the relation of the
divine unity to the divinity of Christ reached a temporary
conclusion, the cultus was elaborated and assumed the
essentials of its permanent form, and the episcopate was
made supreme over rival authorities within the Church,
becoming at once the expression and organ of ecclesiastical
unity. At the same time new problems arose; within the
<pb n='141'/><anchor id='Pg141'/>
Church there was the appearance of an organized asceticism
which appeared for a time to be a rival to the Church's
system, and outside the Church the appearance of a hostile
rival in the rapidly spreading Manichæan system, in which
was revived, in a better organized and therefore more dangerous
form, the expelled Gnosticism. The period ends with
the last general persecution (ch. 5).

<head>Chapter I. The Political And Religious Conditions Of The Empire</head>

<p>
The accession of Septimius Severus, A. D. 193, marks a
change in the condition of the Empire. It was becoming
more harassed by frontier wars, not always waged successfully.
Barbarians were gradually settling within the Empire.
The emperors themselves were no longer Romans or Italians.
Provincials, some not even of the Latin race, assumed the
imperial dignity. But it was a period in which the Roman
law was in its most flourishing and brilliant stage, under
such men as Papinian, Ulpian, and others second only to these
masters. Stoic cosmopolitanism made for wider conceptions
of law and a deeper sense of human solidarity. The Christian
Church, however, profited little by this (<ref target="Section_34">§ 34</ref>) until,
in the religious syncretism which became fashionable in the highest
circles, it was favored by even the imperial family along
with other Oriental religions (<ref target="Section_35">§ 35</ref>). The varying
fortunes of the emperors necessarily affected the Church
(<ref target="Section_36">§ 36</ref>), though, on the whole,
there was little suffering, and the Church spread
rapidly, and in many parts of the Empire became a powerful
organization (<ref target="Section_37">§ 37</ref>), with which the State would soon have
to reckon.

<head>§ 34. State and Church under Septimius Severus and Caracalla</head>

<p>
Although Christians were at first favored by Septimius
Severus, they were still liable to the severe laws against
secret societies, and the policy of Septimius was later to enforce
these laws. The Christians tried to escape the penalties
prescribed against such societies by taking the form of
friendly societies which were expressly tolerated by the law.
Nevertheless, numerous cases are to be found in various
parts of the Empire in which Christians were put to death
under the law. Yet the number of martyrs before the general
persecution of Decius in the middle of the century was
relatively small. The position of Christians was not materially
affected by the constitution of Caracalla conferring
Roman citizenship on all free inhabitants of the Empire, and
the constitution seems to have been merely a fiscal measure
which laid additional burdens upon the provincials.

The account of Tertullian is generally accepted as substantially
correct. Scapula was chief magistrate of Carthage and, under the
circumstances, the author would not have indulged his tendency to
rhetorical embellishment. Furthermore, the book is written with what
was for Tertullian great moderation.

<p>
How many rulers, men more resolute and more cruel than
you, have contrived to get quit of such causes—as Cincius
Severus, who himself suggested the remedy at Thysdris,
pointing out how Christians should answer that they might
be acquitted; as Vespronius Candidus, who acquitted a
Christian on the ground that to satisfy his fellow-citizens
would create a riot; as Asper, who, in the case of a man
who under slight torture had fallen, did not compel him to
<pb n='143'/><anchor id='Pg143'/>
offer sacrifice, having owned among the advocates and assessors
of the court that he was annoyed at having to meddle
with such a case! Prudens, too, at once dismissed a Christian
brought before him, perceiving from the indictment that
it was a case of vexatious accusation; tearing the document
in pieces, he refused, according to the imperial command,
to hear him without the presence of his accuser. All this
might be officially brought under your notice, and by the
very advocates, who themselves are under obligations to
Christians, although they cry out against us as it suits them.
The clerk of one who was liable to be thrown down by an
evil spirit was set free; as was also a relative of another, and
the little boy of a third. How many men of rank (not to mention
common people) have been cured of devils and of diseases!
Even Severus himself, the father of Antonine, was mindful
of the Christians; for he sought out the Christian Proclus,
surnamed Torpacion, the steward of Euhodias, who once had
cured him by means of oil, and whom he kept in his palace
till his death. Antonine [Caracalla], too, was brought up on
Christian milk,<note place="foot">Probably his wet-nurse was a Christian.</note>
was intimately acquainted with this man.
But Severus, knowing both men and women of the highest
rank to be of this sect, not only did not injure them, but
distinguished them with his testimony and restored them
to us openly from the raging populace.<note place="foot">On the occasion
of his triumphal entry into Rome.</note>

By princely commands it was prescribed to the governors

is permitted to the poor to collect a monthly contribution,

a pretext of this sort an unlawful society meet. And that
this should be allowed not only in the city, but also in Italy
and the provinces, the divine Severus ordered. But for the
sake of religion they are not forbidden to come together so
long as they do nothing contrary to the Senatus-consultum,
by which unlawful societies are restrained. It is furthermore
not lawful to belong to more than one lawful society, as this
was determined by the divine brothers [Caracalla and Geta];
and if any one is in two, it is ordered that it be necessary
for him to choose in which he prefers to be, and he shall
receive from the society from which he resigns that which
belongs to him proportionately of what there is of a common

Though we have our treasure-chest, it is not made up of
purchase money, as if our religion had its price. On the
regular day in the month, or when one prefers, each one makes
a small donation; but only if it be his pleasure, and only if
he be able; for no one is compelled, but gives voluntarily.
These gifts are, as it were, piety's deposit fund. For they
are taken thence and spent, not on feasts and drinking-bouts,
and thankless eating-houses, but to support and bury poor
people, to supply the wants of boys and girls destitute of
means and parents, and of old persons confined to the
house, likewise the shipwrecked, and if there happen to be
any in the mines, or banished to the islands, or shut up in

has been from the middle of the fourth century at Rome
March 7. See Kirch, p. 323.
</quote>

<pb n='146'/><anchor id='Pg146'/>

<p>
The day of their victory dawned, and they proceeded
from the prison into the amphitheatre, as if to happiness,
joyous and of brilliant countenances; if, perchance, shrinking,
it was with joy and not with fear. Perpetua followed with
placid look, and with step and gait as a matron of Christ,
beloved of God, casting down the lustre of her eyes from the
gaze of all. Likewise Felicitas came, rejoicing that she had
safely brought forth, so that she might fight with the beasts.…
And when they were brought to the gate, and were
constrained to put on the clothing—the men that of the priests
of Saturn, and the women that of those who were consecrated
to Ceres—that noble-minded woman resisted even to the end
with constancy. For she said: <q>We have come thus far of
our own accord, that our liberty might not be restrained.
For this reason we have yielded our minds, that we might
not do any such thing as this; we have agreed on this with
you.</q> Injustice acknowledged the justice; the tribune permitted
that they be brought in simply as they were. Perpetua
sang psalms, already treading under foot the head of
the Egyptian [seen in a vision; see preceding chapters]; Revocatus
and Saturninus and Saturus uttered threatenings
against the gazing people about this martyrdom. When
they came within sight of Hilarianus, by gesture and nod
they began to say to Hilarianus: <q>Thou judgest us, but
God will judge thee.</q> At this the exasperated people demanded
that they should be tormented with scourges as they
passed along the rank of the <foreign lang="la"
rend="font-style: italic">venatores</foreign>. And they, indeed,
rejoiced that they should have incurred any one of their
Lord's passions.
</p>

<p>
But He who had said, <q>Ask and ye shall receive,</q> gave to
them, when they asked, that death which each one had desired.
For when they had been discoursing among themselves
about their wish as to their martyrdom, Saturninus, indeed,
had professed that he wished that he might be thrown to all
the beasts; doubtless that he might wear a more glorious
crown. Therefore, in the beginning of the exhibition he
<pb n='147'/><anchor id='Pg147'/>
and Revocatus made trial of the leopard, and, moreover, upon
the scaffold they were harassed by the bear. Saturus, however,
held nothing in greater horror than a bear; but he
thought he would be finished by one bite of a leopard.
Therefore, when a wild boar was supplied, it was the huntsman
who had supplied that boar, and not Saturus, who was
gored by that same beast and who died the day after the
shows. Saturus only was drawn out; and when he had been
bound on the floor near to a bear, the bear would not come
forth from his den. And so Saturus for the second time was
recalled, unhurt.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, for the young women the devil, rivalling their
sex also in that of the beasts, prepared a very fierce cow,
provided especially for that purpose contrary to custom.
And so, stripped and clothed with nets, they were led forth.
The populace shuddered as they saw one young woman of
delicate frame, and another with breasts still dropping from
her recent childbirth. So, being recalled, they were unbound.
Perpetua was first led in. She was tossed and fell on her
loins; and when she saw her tunic torn from her side, she
drew it over her as a veil for her thighs, mindful of her modesty
rather than of her suffering. Then she was called for
again, and bound up her dishevelled hair; for it was not
becoming for a martyr to suffer with dishevelled hair, lest
she should appear to be mourning in her glory. She rose up,
and when she saw Felicitas crushed she approached and
gave her her hand and lifted her up. And both of them
stood together; and the brutality of the populace being
appeased, they were recalled to the Sanavivarian gate. Then
Perpetua was received by a certain one who was still a
catechumen, Rusticus by name, who kept close to her; and
she, as if roused from sleep, so deeply had she been in the
Spirit and in an ecstasy, began to look around her and to
say to the amazement of all: <q>I do not know when we are
to be led out to that cow.</q> Thus she said, and when she
had heard what had already happened, she did not believe
<pb n='148'/><anchor id='Pg148'/>
it until she had perceived certain signs of injury in her own
body and in her dress, and had recognized the catechumen.
Afterward, causing that catechumen and the brother to
approach, she addressed them, saying: <q>Stand fast in the
faith, and love one another, all of you, and be not offended
at our sufferings.</q>
</p>

<p>
The same Saturus at the other entrance exhorted the
soldier Prudens, saying: <q>Assuredly here I am, as I have
promised and foretold, for up to this moment I have felt no
beast. And now believe with your whole heart. Lo, I am
going forth to the leopard, and I shall be destroyed with one
bite.</q> And immediately on the conclusion of the exhibition
he was thrown to the leopard; and with one bite by it he was
bathed with such a quantity of blood that the people shouted
out to him, as he was returning, the testimony of his second
baptism: <q>Saved and washed, saved and washed.</q> Manifestly
he was assuredly saved who had been glorified in such
a spectacle. Then to the soldier Prudens he said: <q>Farewell,
and be mindful of my faith; and let not these things disturb,
but confirm you.</q> And at the same time he asked for a little
ring from his finger, and returned it to him bathed in his
wound, leaving to him an inherited token and memory of
his blood. And then lifeless he was cast down with the rest,
to be slaughtered in the usual place. And when the populace
called for them into the midst, that as the sword penetrated
into their body they might make their eyes partners in the
murder, they rose up of their own accord, and transferred
themselves whither the people wished; but they first kissed
one another, that they might consummate their martyrdom
with the rites of peace. The rest, indeed, immovable and
in silence, received the sword; and so did Saturus, who had
also first ascended the ladder, and first gave up his spirit,
for he was waiting for Perpetua. But Perpetua, that she
might taste some pain, being pierced between the ribs, cried
out loudly and she herself placed the wavering right hand
of the youthful gladiator to her throat. Possibly such a
<pb n='149'/><anchor id='Pg149'/>
woman could not have been slain unless she herself had
willed it, because she was feared by the impure spirit.
</p>

<p>
O most brave and blessed martyrs! O truly called and
chosen unto the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ! Whoever
magnifies, and honors, and adores Him, assuredly ought
to read these examples for the edification of the Church, not
less than the ancient ones, so that new virtues also may
testify that one and the same Holy Spirit is always operating
even until now, and God the Father Omnipotent, and his
Son Jesus Christ our Lord, whose is glory and infinite power
forever and ever. Amen.

<head>§ 35. Religious Syncretism in the Third Century</head>

<p>
In the third century religious syncretism took two leading
forms—the Mithraic worship, which spread rapidly throughout
the Empire, and the fashionable interest in novel religions
fostered by the imperial court. Mithraism was especially
prevalent in the army, and at army posts have been found
numerous remains of sanctuaries, inscriptions, etc. It was
by far the purest of the religions that invaded the Roman
Empire, and drew its leading ideas from Persian sources.
The fashionable court interest in novel religions seems not
to have amounted to much as a positive religious force,
which Mithraism certainly was, though on account of it
Christianity was protected and even patronized by the ladies
of the imperial household. Among the works produced by
this interest was the <hi rend='italic'>Life of Apollonius of Tyana</hi>, written
by Philostratus at the command of the Empress Julia Domna.
Apollonius was a preacher or teacher of ethics and the Neo-Pythagorean
philosophy in the first century, <hi rend='italic'>ob.</hi> A. D. 97.

The following prayer is the opening invocation of what appears
to be a Mithraic liturgy, and may date from a period earlier than the
fourth century. It gives, as is natural, no elaborated statement of
Mithraic doctrine, but, as in all prayer, much is implied in the forms
used and the spirit of the religion breathed through it. The combination
has already begun as is shown by the doctrine of the four elements.
It should be added that Professor Cumont does not regard it as a
Mithraic liturgy at all, but accounts for the distinct mention of the
name Mithras, which is to be found in some parts, to a common tendency
of semi-magical incantations to employ as many deities as possible.

Heliogabalus to Philip the Arabian, 217-249</head>

<p>
With the brief exception of the reign of Maximinus Thrax
(235-238), Christians enjoyed peace from the death of Caracalla
to the death of Philip the Arabian. This was not due
<pb n='152'/><anchor id='Pg152'/>
to disregard of the laws against Christians nor to indifference
to suspected dangers to the Empire arising from the new
religion, but to the policy of religious syncretism which had
come in with the family of Severus. The wife of Septimius
Severus was the daughter of Julius Bassianus, priest of the
Sun-god of Emesa, and of the rulers of the dynasty of Severus
one, Heliogabalus, was himself a priest of the same syncretistic
cult, and another, Alexander, was under the influence
of the women of the same priestly family.

But I wish to tell you about an affair connected with this
very matter [baptism by heretics, the main subject of the

which occurred among us. About
twenty years ago, in the time after Emperor Alexander, there
happened in these parts many struggles and difficulties, either
in common to all men or privately to Christians. There were,
furthermore, many and frequent earthquakes, so that many
cities throughout Cappadocia and Pontus were thrown down;
and some even were dragged down into the abyss and swallowed
by the gaping earth. From this, also, there arose a
severe persecution against the Christian name. This arose
suddenly after the long peace of the previous age. Because
of the unexpected and unaccustomed evil, it was rendered
more terrible for the disturbance of our people.
</p>

<p>
Serenianus was at that time governor of our province, a
bitter and cruel persecutor. But when the faithful had been
thus disturbed and were fleeing hither and thither from fear
of persecution and were leaving their native country and
crossing over to other regions—for there was opportunity of
crossing over, because this persecution was not over the
whole world, but was local—there suddenly arose among us
a certain woman who in a state of ecstasy announced herself
<pb n='155'/><anchor id='Pg155'/>
as a prophetess and acted as if filled with the Holy Ghost.
And she was so moved by the power of the chief demons that
for a long time she disturbed the brethren and deceived them;
for she accomplished certain wonderful and portentous things:
thus, she promised that she would cause the earth to be
shaken, not that the power of the demon was so great that
he could shake the earth and disturb the elements, but that
sometimes a wicked spirit, foreseeing and understanding that
there will be an earthquake, pretends that he will do what
he foresees will take place. By these lies and boastings he
had so subdued the minds of several that they obeyed him
and followed whithersoever he commanded and led. He
would also make that woman walk in the bitter cold of
winter with bare feet over the frozen snow, and not to be
troubled or hurt in any respect by walking in this fashion.
Moreover, she said she was hurrying to Judea and Jerusalem,
pretending that she had come thence. Here, also, she
deceived Rusticus, one of the presbyters, and another one
who was a deacon, so that they had intercourse with the
same woman. This was shortly after detected. For there
suddenly appeared before her one of the exorcists, a man
approved and always well versed in matters of religious discipline;
he, moved by the exhortation of many of the brethren,
also, who were themselves strong in the faith, and praiseworthy,
raised himself up against that wicked spirit to overcome
it; for the spirit a little while before, by its subtle deceitfulness,
had predicted, furthermore, that a certain adverse
and unbelieving tempter would come. Yet that exorcist,
inspired by God's grace, bravely resisted and showed that
he who before was regarded as holy was a most wicked spirit.
But that woman, who previously, by the wiles and deceits
of the demon, was attempting many things for the deception
of the faithful, had among other things by which she deceived
many also frequently dared this—to pretend that with an
invocation, not to be contemned, she sanctified bread and
consecrated the eucharist and offered sacrifice to the Lord
<pb n='156'/><anchor id='Pg156'/>
without the sacrament as customarily uttered; and to have
baptized many, making use of the usual and lawful words of
interrogation, that nothing might seem to be different from
the ecclesiastical and lawful mode.

<head>Chapter II. The Internal Development Of The Church In Doctrine, Custom, And
Constitution</head>

<p>
The characteristic Eastern and Western conceptions of
Christianity began to be clearly differentiated in the early
years of the third century. A juristic conception of the
Church as a body at the head of which, and clothed with
authority, appeared the bishop of Rome, had, indeed, become
current at Rome in the last decade of the second century
on the occasion of the Easter controversy, which had
ended in an estrangement between the previously closely
affiliated churches of Asia Minor and the West, especially
Rome (<ref target="Section_38">§ 38</ref>). Western theology soon became centred in
North Africa under the legally trained Tertullian, by whom
its leading principles were laid down in harmony with the
bent of the Latin genius (<ref target="Section_39">§ 39</ref>). In this period numerous
attempts were made to solve the problem arising from the
unity of God and the divinity of Christ, without recourse to
a Logos christology. Some of the more unsuccessful of these
attempts have since been grouped under the heads of Dynamistic
and of Modalistic Monarchianism (<ref target="Section_40">§ 40</ref>). At the same
time Montanism was excluded from the Church (<ref target="Section_41">§ 41</ref>), as
subversive of the distinction between the clergy and laity
<pb n='160'/><anchor id='Pg160'/>
and the established organs of the Church's government,
which in the recent rise of a theory of the necessity of the
episcopate (see above, <ref target="Section_27">§ 27</ref>) had become important. In the
administration of the penitential discipline (<ref target="Section_42">§ 42</ref>)
the position of the clergy and the realization of a hierarchically
organized Church was still further advanced, preparatory for
the position of Cyprian. At the same time as these constitutional
developments were taking place in the West, and
especially in North Africa, there occurred in Egypt and
Palestine a remarkable advance in doctrinal discussion,
whereby the theology of the apologists was developed in the
Catechetical School of Alexandria, especially under the leadership
of Clement of Alexandria and Origen (<ref target="Section_43">§ 43</ref>). In this
new speculation a vast mass of most fruitful theological ideas
was built up, from which subsequent ages drew for the defence
of the traditional faith, but some of which served as the basis
of new and startling heresies. Corresponding to the intellectual
development within the Church was the last phase of
Hellenic philosophy, known as Neo-Platonism (<ref target="Section_44">§ 44</ref>), which
subsequently came into bitter conflict with the Church.

<head>§ 38. The Easter Controversy and the Separation of
the Churches of Asia Minor from the Western Churches</head>

<p>
The Church grew up with only a loose form of organization.
Each local congregation was for a while autonomous,
and it was the local constitution that first took a definite and
fixed form. In the first centuries local customs naturally varied,
and conflicts were sure to arise when various hitherto
isolated churches came into closer contact and the sense of
solidarity deepened. The first clash of opposing customs occurred
over the date of Easter, as to which marked differences
existed between the churches of Asia Minor, at that
time the most flourishing part of the Church, and the churches
of the West, especially with the church of Rome, the strongest
local church of all. The course of the controversy is sufficiently
stated in the following selection from Eusebius. The
outcome was the practical isolation of the churches of Asia
Minor for many years. The controversy was not settled, and
the churches of Asia Minor did not again play a prominent
part in the Church until the time of Constantine and the
Council of Nicæa, 325 (see <ref target="Section_62_i_b">§ 62,
<hi rend='italic'>b</hi></ref>), although a provisional adjustment
of the difficulty, so far as the West was concerned,
took place shortly before, at the Council of Arles (see

<p>
Ch. 23. At this time a question of no small importance
arose. For the parishes [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, dioceses in the later sense of that
word] of all Asia, as from an older tradition, held that the
fourteenth day of the moon, being the day on which the Jews
were commanded to sacrifice the lamb, should be observed
as the feast of the Saviour's passover, and that it was necessary,
<pb n='162'/><anchor id='Pg162'/>
therefore, to end their fast on that day, on whatever
day of the week it might happen to fall. It was not, however,
the custom of the churches elsewhere to end it at this time,
but they observed the practice, which from apostolic tradition
has prevailed to the present time, of ending the fast on
no other day than that of the resurrection of the Saviour.
Synods and assemblies of bishops were held on this account,
and all with one consent, by means of letters addressed to
all, drew up an ecclesiastical decree that the mystery of the
resurrection of the Lord from the dead should be celebrated
on no other day than on the Lord's Day, and that we should
observe the close of the paschal fast on that day only. There
is still extant a writing of those who were then assembled
in Palestine, over whom Theophilus, bishop of the parish of
Cæsarea, and Narcissus, Bishop of Jerusalem, presided; also
another of those who were likewise assembled at Rome, on
account of the same question, which bears the name of Victor;
also of the bishops in Pontus, over whom Palmas, as the
oldest, presided; and of the parishes in Gaul, of which Irenæus
was bishop; and of those in Osrhoene and the cities there;
and a personal letter of Bacchylus, bishop of the church in
Corinth, and of a great many others who uttered one and
the same opinion and judgment and cast the same vote.
Of these, there was one determination of the question which
has been stated.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 24. But the bishops of Asia, led by Polycrates, decided
to hold fast to the customs handed down to them. He himself,
in a letter addressed to Victor and the church of Rome,
set forth the tradition which had come down to him as follows:
<q>We observe the exact day, neither adding nor taking
anything away. For in Asia, also, great lights have fallen
asleep, which shall rise again on the day of the Lord's coming,
when He shall come with glory from heaven and shall seek out
all the saints. Of these were Philip, one of the twelve Apostles,
who fell asleep at Hierapolis, and his two aged virgin daughters
and his other daughter, who, having lived in the Holy
<pb n='163'/><anchor id='Pg163'/>
Spirit, rest at Ephesus; and, moreover, John, who reclined
on the Lord's bosom, and being a priest wore the sacerdotal
mitre, who was both a witness and a teacher; he fell asleep
at Ephesus; and, further, Polycarp in Smyrna, both a bishop
and a martyr.… All these observed the fourteenth day
of the passover, according to the Gospel, deviating in no respect,
but following the rule of faith. And I, Polycrates, do
the same, the least of you all, according to the tradition of
my relatives, some of whom I have closely followed. For
seven of my relatives were bishops, and I am the eighth.
And my relatives always observed the day when the people
put away the leaven; I, therefore, am not affrighted by
terrifying words. For those greater than I have said, We
ought to obey God rather than men.</q>… Thereupon<note place="foot">From
here text in Kirch, nn. 84 <hi rend='italic'>ff.</hi></note> Victor,
who was over the church of Rome, immediately attempted to
cut off from the common unity the parishes of all Asia, with
the churches that agreed with them, as being heterodox. And
he published letters declaring that all the brethren there were
wholly excommunicated. But this did not please all the bishops,
and they besought him to consider the things of peace, of
neighborly unity and love. Words of theirs are still extant,
rather sharply rebuking Victor. Among these were Irenæus,
who sent letters in the name of the brethren in Gaul, over
whom he presided, and maintained that the mystery of the resurrection
of the Lord should be observed only on the Lord's
Day, yet he fittingly admonishes Victor that he should not
cut off whole churches of God which observed the tradition
of an ancient custom, and after many other words he proceeds
as follows: <q>For the controversy is not merely concerning
the day, but also concerning the very manner of the fast.
For some think that they should fast one day, others two,
yet others more; some, moreover, count their days as consisting
of forty hours day and night. And this variety of
observance has not originated in our times, but long before,
in the days of our ancestors. It is likely that they did not
<pb n='164'/><anchor id='Pg164'/>
hold to strict accuracy, and thus was formed a custom for
their posterity, according to their own simplicity and their
peculiar method. Yet all these lived more or less in peace,
and we also live in peace with one another; and the disagreement
in regard to the fast confirms the agreement in
the faith.… Among these were the elders [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, bishops of
earlier date] before Soter, who presided over the church
which thou [Victor] now rulest. We mean Anicetus, and
Pius, and Hyginus, and Telesphorus, and Sixtus. They
neither observed it themselves nor did they permit others
after them to do so. And yet, though they did not observe
it, they were none the less at peace with those who came to
them from the parishes in which it was observed, although
this observance was more opposed to those who did not
observe it. But none were ever cast out on account of this
form, but the elders before thee, who did not observe it, sent
the eucharist to those of the other parishes observing it. And
when the blessed Polycarp was at Rome in the time of Anicetus,
and they disagreed a little about certain other things,
they immediately made peace with one another, not caring
to quarrel over this point. For neither could Anicetus persuade
Polycarp not to observe what he had always observed
with John, the disciple of the Lord, and the other Apostles
with whom he had associated; neither could Polycarp persuade
Anicetus to observe it, as he said that he ought to follow
the customs of the elders who had preceded him. But though
matters were thus, they nevertheless communed together
and Anicetus granted the eucharist in the church to Polycarp,
manifestly as a mark of respect.<note place="foot">Probably the reference is
to the privilege of celebrating the eucharist, and
not merely the reception of the sacrament from the hands of Anicetus.</note>
And they parted from each
other in peace, maintaining the peace of the whole Church,
both of those who observed and those who did not.</q> Thus
Irenæus, who was truly well named, became a peace-maker
in this matter, exhorting and negotiating in this way for the
peace of the churches. And he conferred by letter about this
<pb n='165'/><anchor id='Pg165'/>
disputed question, not only with Victor, but also with most
of the other rulers of the churches.

<head>§ 39. The Religion of the West: Its Moral and Juristic
Character</head>

<p>
In the writings of Tertullian a conception of Christianity
is quite fully developed according to which the Gospel was a
new law of life, with its prescribed holy seasons and hours
for prayer; its sacrifices, though as yet only sacrifices of
prayer; its fasts and almsgiving, which had propitiatory
effect, atoning for sins committed and winning merit with
God; its sacred rites, solemnly administered by an established
hierarchy; and all observed for the sake of a reward which
God in justice owed those who kept His commandments.
It is noticeable that already there is the same divided opinion
as to marriage, whereby, on the one hand, it was regarded as
a concession to weakness, a necessary evil, and, on the other,
a high and holy relation, strictly monogamous, and of abiding
worth. The propitiatory and meritorious character of fasts
and almsgiving as laid down by Tertullian was developed
even further by Cyprian and became a permanent element
in the penitential system of the Church, ultimately affecting
its conception of redemption.
</p>

<div>
<head>(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) Tertullian, <hi rend='italic'>De Oratione</hi>, 23, 25,
28. (MSL, 1:1298.)</head>

<p>
Ch. 23. As to kneeling, also, prayer is subject to diversity
of observance on account of a few who abstain from kneeling
on the Sabbath. Since this dissension is particularly on its
trial before the churches, the Lord will give His grace that
the dissentients may either yield or else follow their own
opinion without offence to the others. We, however, as we
have received, only on the Sunday of the resurrection ought
to guard not only against this kneeling, but every posture and
office of anxiety; deferring even our businesses, lest we give
any place to the devil. Similarly, too, the period of Pentecost,
<pb n='166'/><anchor id='Pg166'/>
is a time which we distinguish by the same solemnity of
exultation. But who would hesitate every day to prostrate
himself before God, at least in the first prayer with which we
enter on the daylight? At fasts, moreover, and stations, no
prayer should be made without kneeling and the remaining
customary marks of humility. For then we are not only
praying, but making supplication, and making satisfaction to
our Lord God.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 25. Touching the time, however, the extrinsic observance
of certain hours will not be unprofitable; those common
hours, I mean, which mark the intervals of the day—the
third, the sixth, the ninth—which we may find in Scripture
to have been more solemn than the rest.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 28. This is the spiritual victim which has abolished
the pristine sacrifices.… We are the true adorers and true
priests, who, praying in the spirit, in the spirit sacrifice prayer,
proper and acceptable to God, which, assuredly, He has
required, which He has looked forward to for Himself. This
victim, devoted from the whole heart, fed on faith, tended
by truth, entire in innocence, pure in chastity, garlanded
with love [agape], we ought to escort with the pomp of good
works, amid psalms and hymns, unto God's altar, to obtain
all things from God for us.

Since He himself both commands fasting and calls a soul
wholly shattered—properly, of course, by straits of diet—a
sacrifice (Psalm 51:18), who will any longer doubt that of all
macerations as to food the rationale has been this: that by a
renewed interdiction of food and observance of the precept
the primordial sin might now be expiated, so that man may
make God satisfaction through the same causative material
by which he offended, that is, by interdiction of food; and
so, by way of emulation, hunger might rekindle, just as

<p>
It remains to put you in mind, also, of the due observance
of giving and receiving baptism. The chief priest
(<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">summus
sacerdos</foreign>), who is the bishop, has the right of giving it; in the
second place, the presbyters and deacons, yet not without
the bishop's authority, on account of the honor of the Church.
When this has been preserved, peace is preserved. Besides
these, even laymen have the right; for what is equally
received can be equally given. If there are no bishops,
priests, or deacons, other disciples are called. The word of
the Lord ought not to be hidden away by any. In like manner,
also, baptism, which is equally God's property, can be administered
by all; but how much more is the rule of reverence
and modesty incumbent on laymen, since these things belong
to their superiors, lest they assume to themselves the specific
functions of the episcopate! Emulation of the episcopal
office is the mother of schism.

over the exacting and maintaining of justice, which is
most dear to Him, and since it is for the sake of justice that
He appoints the whole sum of His discipline, ought one to
doubt that, as in all our acts universally, so, also, in the case

I, 3. There is no place at all where we read that marriages
are prohibited; of course as a <q>good thing.</q> What, however,
is better than this <q>good,</q> we learn from the Apostle in that
he permits marriage, indeed, but prefers abstinence; the
former on account of the insidiousness of temptations, the
latter on account of the straits of the times (I Cor. 7:26).
Now by examining the reason for each statement it is easily
seen that the permission to marry is conceded us as a necessity;
but whatever necessity grants, she herself deprecates.
In fact, inasmuch as it is written, <q>It is better to marry than
to burn</q> (I Cor. 7:9), what sort of <q>good</q> is this which is
only commended by comparison with <q>evil,</q> so that the
reason why <q>marrying</q> is better is merely that <q>burning</q>
is worse? Nay; but how much better is it neither to marry
nor to burn?

confirms, and the benediction seals; which
the angels announce, and the Father holds for ratified? For
even on earth children do not rightly and lawfully wed without
their father's consent. What kind of yoke is that of two
believers of one hope, one discipline, and the same service?
The two are brethren, the two are fellow-servants; no difference
of spirit or flesh; nay, truly, two in one flesh; where there
is one flesh the spirit is one.

<p>
Ch. 1. Many and great, beloved brethren, are the divine
benefits wherewith the large and abundant mercy of God
the Father and of Christ both has labored and is always laboring
for our salvation: because the Father sent the Son to preserve
us and give us life, that He might restore us; and the
Son was willing to be sent and to become the son of man, that
He might make us the sons of God. He humbled Himself
that He might raise up the people who before were prostrate;
He was wounded that He might heal our wounds; He served
that He might draw to liberty those who were in bondage;
He underwent death, that He might set forth immortality to
mortals. These are many and great boons of compassion.
But, moreover, what a providence, and how great the clemency,
that by a plan of salvation it is provided for us that
more abundant care should be taken for preserving man
who has been redeemed! For when the Lord, coming to us,
had cured those wounds which Adam had borne, and had
healed the old poisons of the serpent, He gave a law to the
sound man, and bade him sin no more lest a worse thing
should befall the sinner. We had been limited and shut up
in a narrow space by the commandment of innocence. Nor
should the infirmity and weakness of human frailty have
anything it might do, unless the divine mercy, coming again
in aid, should open some way of securing salvation by pointing
out works of justice and mercy, so that by almsgiving we
may wash away whatever foulness we subsequently contract.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 2. The Holy Spirit speaks in the sacred Scriptures
saying, <q>By almsgiving and faith sins are purged</q> [Prov.
16:6]. Not, of course, those sins which had been previously
contracted, for these are purged by the blood and sanctification
of Christ. Moreover, He says again, <q>As water extinguishes
fire, so almsgiving quencheth sin</q> [Eccles. 3:30].
Here, also, is shown and proved that as by the laver of the
saving water the fire of Gehenna is extinguished, so, also, by
almsgiving and works of righteousness the flame of sin is
subdued. And because in baptism remission of sins is granted
<pb n='171'/><anchor id='Pg171'/>
once and for all, constant and ceaseless labor, following the
likeness of baptism, once again bestows the mercy of God.…
The Lord also teaches this in the Gospel.… The Merciful
One teaches and warns that works of mercy be performed;
because He seeks to save those who at great cost He has
redeemed, it is proper that those who after the grace of
baptism have become foul can once more be cleansed.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 5. The remedies for propitiating God are given in
the words of God himself. The divine instructions have taught
sinners what they ought to do; that by works of righteousness
God is satisfied, and with the merits of mercy sins are
cleansed.… He [the angel Raphael, <hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Tobit. 12:8, 9]
shows that our prayers and fastings are of little avail unless
they are aided by almsgiving; that entreaties alone are of
little force to obtain what they seek, unless they be made
sufficient by the addition of deeds and good works. The
angel reveals and manifests and certifies that our petitions
become efficacious by almsgiving, that life is redeemed from
dangers by almsgiving, that souls are delivered from death
by almsgiving.

<head>§ 40. The Monarchian Controversies</head>

<p>
Monarchianism is a general term used to include all the
unsuccessful attempts of teachers within the Church to explain
the divine element in Christ without doing violence to the
doctrine of the unity of God, and yet without employing the
Logos christology. These attempts were made chiefly between
the latter part of the second century and the
end of the third. They fall into classes accordingly as
they regard the divine element in Christ as personal or
impersonal. One class makes the divine element to be an
impersonal power (Greek, dynamis) sent from God into the
man Jesus; hence the term <q>Dynamistic Monarchians.</q>
The other class makes the divine element a person, without,
however, making any personal distinction between Father
and Son, only a difference in the mode in which the one
<pb n='172'/><anchor id='Pg172'/>
divine person manifests Himself; hence the term <q>Modalistic
Monarchians.</q> By some the Dynamistic Monarchians have
been called Adoptionists, because they generally taught that
the man Jesus ultimately became the Son of God, not being
such by nature but by <q>adoption.</q> The name Adoptionist
has been so long applied to a heresy of the eighth century,
chiefly in Spain, that it leads to confusion to use the term in
connection with Monarchianism. Furthermore, to speak of
them as Dynamistic Monarchians groups them with other
Monarchians, which is desirable. The most important school
of Modalistic Monarchians was that of Sabellius, in which
the Modalistic principle was developed so as to include the
three persons of the Trinity.

36. (MSG, 16:3342.)</head>

<p>
Ch. 35. A certain Theodotus, a native of Byzantium,
introduced a novel heresy, saying some things concerning the
origin of the universe partly in keeping with the doctrines of
the true Church, in so far as he admits that all things were
created by God. Forcibly appropriating, however, his idea
of Christ from the Gnostics and from Cerinthus and Ebion, he
alleges that He appeared somewhat as follows: that Jesus
was a man, born of a virgin, according to the counsel of the
Father, and that after He had lived in a way common to all
men, and had become pre-eminently religious, He afterward
at His baptism in Jordan received Christ, who came from
above and descended upon Him. Therefore miraculous powers
did not operate within Him prior to the manifestation of that
Spirit which descended and proclaimed Him as the Christ.
But some [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, among the followers of Theodotus] are disposed
to think that this man never was God, even at the
descent of the Spirit; whereas others maintain that He was
made God after the resurrection from the dead.

<pb n='173'/><anchor id='Pg173'/>

Ch. 36. While, however, different questions have arisen
among them, a certain one named Theodotus, by trade a
money-changer [to be distinguished from the other Theodotus,
who is commonly spoken of as Theodotus, the leather-worker],
attempted to establish the doctrine that a certain Melchizedek
is the greatest power, and that this one is greater than
Christ. And they allege that Christ happens to be according
to the likeness of this one. And they themselves, similarly
with those who have been previously spoken of as adherents
of Theodotus, assert that Jesus is a mere man, and that in
conformity with the same account, Christ descended upon
Him.

The Artemonites say that all early teachers and the Apostles
themselves received and taught what they now declare,
and that the truth of the preaching [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the Gospel] was
preserved until the time of Victor, who was the thirteenth
bishop in Rome after Peter, and that since his successor,
Zephyrinus, the truth has been corrupted. What they say
might be credible if first of all the divine Scriptures did not
contradict them. And there are writings of certain brethren
which are older than the times of Victor, and which they
wrote in behalf of the truth against the heathen and against
heresies of their time. I refer to Justin, Miltiades, Tatian,
Clement, and others. In all of their works Christ is spoken
of as God. For who does not know the works of Irenæus and
of Melito and of others, which teach that Christ is God and
man? And how many psalms and hymns, written by the
faithful brethren from the beginning, celebrate Christ as the
Word of God, speaking of Him as divine? How, then, since
the Church's present opinion has been preached for so many
<pb n='174'/><anchor id='Pg174'/>
years, can its preaching have been delayed, as they affirm,
until the times of Victor? And how is it that they are not
ashamed to speak thus falsely of Victor, knowing well that
he cut off from communion Theodotus, the leather-worker,
the leader and father of this God-denying apostasy, and the
first to declare that Christ is mere man.
</p>

<p>
There was a certain confessor, Natalius, not long ago, but
in our day. This man was deceived at one time by Asclepiodotus
and another Theodotus, a certain money-changer.
Both of them were disciples of Theodotus, the leather-worker,
who, as I said, was the first person excommunicated
by Victor, bishop at that time, on account of this senseless
sentiment or, rather, senselessness. Natalius was persuaded
by them to allow himself to be chosen bishop of this heresy
with a salary, so that he was to receive from them one hundred
and fifty <hi rend='italic'>denarii</hi> a month.
</p>

<p>
They have treated the divine Scriptures recklessly and
without fear; they have set aside the rule of ancient faith;
and Christ they have not known, not endeavoring to learn
what the divine Scriptures declare, but striving laboriously
after any form of syllogism which may be found to suit their
impiety. And if any one brings before them a passage of
divine Scripture, they see whether a conjunctive or a disjunctive
form of syllogism can be made from it. And as
being of the earth and speaking of the earth and as ignorant
of Him that cometh from above, they devote themselves to
geometry and forsake the holy writings of God. Euclid is
at least laboriously measured by some of them; Aristotle
and Theophrastus admired; and Galen, perhaps, by some is
even worshipped. But that those who use the arts of unbelievers
for their heretical opinion and adulterate the simple
faith of the divine Scriptures by the craft of the godless are
not near the faith, what need is there to say? Therefore, they
have laid their hands boldly upon the divine Scriptures,
alleging that they have corrected them. That I am not
speaking falsely of them in this matter, whoever wishes can
<pb n='175'/><anchor id='Pg175'/>
learn. For if any one will collect their respective copies and
compare them with one another, he will find that they differ
greatly.

The following passages from the great work of Hippolytus give
the earlier form of Modalistic Monarchianism. They are also of
importance as being a part of the foundation for the statement of
Harnack and others, that this heresy was the official Roman doctrine
for some years. See also IX, 12, of which the text may be found in
Kirch, nn. 201-206. The whole question as to the position of Callistus,
or Calixtus, as bishop of Rome and his relations to the Church
as a whole is difficult and full of obscurity, due to a large extent to
the fact that the principal source for his history is the work of Hippolytus,
who, as may easily be seen, was bitterly opposed to him.
</quote>

<p>
Noetus, a Smyrnæan by birth, a reckless babbler and trickster,
introduced this heresy, which originated with Epigonus,
and was adopted by Cleomenes, and has thus continued to
this day among his successors. Noetus asserts that there is
one Father and God of the universe, and that He who had
made all things was, when He wished, invisible to those who
existed, and when He wished He became visible; that He is
invisible when He is not seen and visible when He is seen;
that the Father is unbegotten when He is not generated,
but begotten when He is born of a virgin; that He is not
subject to suffering and is immortal when He does not suffer
and die, but when His passion came upon Him Noetus
admits that the Father suffers and dies. The Noetians think
that the Father is called the Son according to events at
different times.
</p>

<p>
Callistus supported the heresy of these Noetians, but we
have carefully described his life [see above, <ref
target="Section_19_c">§ 19, <hi rend='italic'>c</hi></ref>]. And
Callistus himself likewise produced a heresy, taking his
<pb n='176'/><anchor id='Pg176'/>
starting-point from these Noetians. And he acknowledges
that there is one Father and God, and that He is the Creator
of the universe, and that He is called and regarded as Son by
name, yet that in substance He is one.<note place="foot">The word substance
as used here in connection with the nature of the
Trinity has not taken its later meaning and use.</note>
For the Spirit as Deity
is not, he says, any being different from the Logos, or the
Logos from Deity; therefore, this one person is divided by
name, but not according to substance. He supposes this
one Logos to be God and he says that He became flesh. He
is disposed to maintain that He who was seen in the flesh and
crucified is Son, but it is the Father who dwells in Him.

Ch. 7. There has appeared a certain one, Noetus by name,
by birth a Smyrnæan. This person introduced from the tenets
of Heraclitus a heresy. Now a certain Epigonus became
his minister and pupil, and this person during his sojourn in
Rome spread his godless opinion.… But Zephyrinus himself
was in course of time enticed away and hurried headlong
into the same opinion; and he had Callistus as his adviser
and fellow-champion of these wicked tenets.… The school
of these heretics continued in a succession of teachers to
acquire strength and to grow because Zephyrinus and Callistus
helped them to prevail.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 11. Now that Noetus affirms that the Son and the
Father are the same, no one is ignorant. But he makes a
statement as follows: <q>When, indeed, at the time the Father
was not yet born, He was justly styled the Father; and when
it pleased Him to undergo generation and to be begotten, He
himself became His own Son, not another's.</q> For in this
manner he thinks he establishes the Monarchy, alleging that
the Father and the Son, so called, are not from one another,
but are one and the same, Himself from Himself, and that He
is styled by the names Father and Son, according to the
changes of times.

<pb n='177'/><anchor id='Pg177'/>

Ch. 12. Now Callistus brought forward Zephyrinus himself
and induced him to avow publicly the following opinions:
<q>I know that there is one God, Jesus Christ; and that excepting
Him I do not know another begotten and capable
of suffering.</q> When he said, <q>The Father did not die but
the Son,</q> he would in this way continue to keep up ceaseless
disturbance among the people. And we [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, Hippolytus],
becoming aware of his opinions, did not give place
to him, but reproved him and withstood him for the truth's
sake. He rushed into folly because all consented to his hypocrisy;

Some others are secretly introducing another doctrine who
have become the disciples of a certain Noetus, who was a
native of Smyrna, and lived not very long ago. This man
was greatly puffed up with pride, being inspired by the conceit
of a strange spirit. He alleged that Christ was the Father
himself, and that the Father himself was born and suffered
and died.… When the blessed presbyters heard these
things they summoned him before the Church and examined
him. But he denied at first that he held such opinions.
Afterward, taking shelter among some and gathering round
him some others who had been deceived in the same way,
he wished to maintain his doctrine openly. And the blessed
presbyters summoned him and examined him. But he
resisted, saying, <q>What evil, then, do I commit when I
glorify Christ?</q> And the presbyters replied to him, <q>We,
too, know in truth one God; we know Christ; we know
that the Son suffered even as He suffered, and died even as
He died, and rose again on the third day, and is at the right
hand of the Father, and cometh to judge the living and the
<pb n='178'/><anchor id='Pg178'/>
dead. And these things which we have learned we assert.</q>
Then, after refuting him, they expelled him from the Church.
And he was carried to such a pitch of pride that he established
a school.
</p>

<p>
Now they seek to exhibit the foundation of their dogma,
alleging that it is said in the Law, <q>I am the God of your
fathers; ye shall have no other gods beside me</q> [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, of
Moses, <hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Ex. 3:6, 13; 20:3]; and again in another passage, <q>I
am the first and the last and besides me there is none other</q>
[<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Is. 44:6]. Thus they assert that God is one. And then
they answer in this manner: <q>If therefore I acknowledge
Christ to be God, He is the Father himself, if He is indeed
God; and Christ suffered, being Himself God, and consequently
the Father suffered, for He was the Father himself.</q>

Ch. 1. In various ways has the devil rivalled the truth.
Sometimes his aim has been to destroy it by defending it.
He maintains that there is one only Lord, the Almighty
Creator of the world, that of this doctrine of the unity he
may fabricate a heresy. He says that the Father himself
came down into the Virgin, was Himself born of her, Himself
suffered, indeed, was Himself Jesus Christ.… He [Praxeas]
was the first to import into Rome this sort of perversity, a
man of restless disposition in other respects, and above all
inflated with the pride of martyrdom [confessorship] simply
and solely because of a short annoyance in prison; when,
even if he had given his body to be burned, it would have
<pb n='179'/><anchor id='Pg179'/>
profited him nothing, not having the love of God, whose
very gifts he resisted and destroyed. For after the Bishop
of Rome had acknowledged the prophetic gifts of Montanus,
Priscilla, and Maximilla, and in consequence of the acknowledgment
had bestowed his peace on the churches of
Asia and Phrygia, Praxeas, by importunately urging false
accusations against the prophets themselves and their churches,
and insisting on the authority of the bishop's predecessors in
the see, compelled him to recall the letter of peace which he
had issued, as well as to desist from his purpose of acknowledging
the said gifts. Thus Praxeas did two pieces of the
devil's work in Rome: he drove out prophecy and he brought
in heresy; he put to flight the Paraclete and he crucified
the Father.

<p>
Ch. 2. After a time, then, the Father was born, and the
Father suffered—God himself, the Almighty, is preached as
Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 27. For, confuted on all sides by the distinction between
the Father and the Son, which we make while their inseparable
union remains as [by the examples] of the sun and the
ray, and the fountain and the river—yet by help of their conceit
of an indivisible number [with issues] of two and three,
they endeavor to interpret this distinction in a way which shall
nevertheless agree with their own opinions; so that, all in one
person, they distinguish two—Father and Son—understanding
the Son to be the flesh, that is the man, that is Jesus; and
the Father to be the Spirit, that is God, that is Christ.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 29. Since we<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>I.e.</hi>, the followers of
Praxeas, who are here introduced as speaking.</note>
teach in precisely the same terms that
the Father died as you say the Son died, we are not guilty
of blasphemy against the Lord God, for we do not say that
He died after the divine nature, but only after the human.…
They [the heretics], indeed, fearing to incur blasphemy against
the Father, hope to diminish it in this way, admitting that
the Father and the Son are two; but if the Son, indeed,
suffers, the Father is His fellow-sufferer.

<head>§ 41. Later Montanism and the Consequences of its Exclusion from the Church</head>

<p>
In the West Montanism rapidly discarded the extravagant
chiliasm of Montanus and his immediate followers; it laid
nearly all the stress upon the continued work of the Holy Spirit
in the Church and the need of a stricter moral discipline among
Christians. This rigoristic discipline or morality was not acceptable
to the bulk of Christians, and along with the Montanists
was driven out of the Church, except in the case of the
clergy, to whom a stricter morality was regarded as applicable.
In this way a distinctive morality and mode of life
came to be assigned to the clergy, and the separation between
clergy and laity, or <hi rend='italic'>ordo</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>plebs</hi>,
which was becoming
<pb n='182'/><anchor id='Pg182'/>
established about the time of Tertullian, at least in the West,
was permanently fixed. (See <ref target="Section_42_d">§ 42,

We should be foolish if we thought that what is unlawful
for priests<note place="foot"><foreign lang="la"

is lawful for laics. Are not even we laics priests?
It is written: <q>He has made us kings also, and priests to

the difference between order [<foreign lang="la"

[<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">plebem</foreign>],
and the honor has been sanctified by the bestowal of the
order. Therefore, where there has been no bestowal of
ecclesiastical order, you both offer and baptize and are a
priest to yourself alone. But where there are three, there is
the Church, though they are laics.… Therefore, if, when
there is necessity, you have the right of a priest in yourself,
you ought also to have the discipline of a priest where there
is necessity that you have the right of a priest. As a
digamist,<note place="foot">A person married a second time,

do you baptize? As a digamist, do you offer? How much
more capital a crime it is for a digamist laic to act as a priest,
when the priest, if he turn digamist, is deprived of the power
of acting as a priest?… God wills that at all times we be
so conditioned as to be fitted at all times and in all places to
undertake His sacraments. There is one God, one faith, one
discipline as well. So truly is this the case that unless the
laics well observe the rules which are to guide the choice of
presbyters, how will there be presbyters at all who are chosen
from among the laics?

<head>§ 42. The Penitential Discipline</head>

<p>
In baptism the convert received remission of all former
sins, and, what was equivalent, admission to the Church.
If he sinned gravely after baptism, could he again obtain
remission? In the first age of the Church the practice as
to this question inclined toward rigorism, and the man who
sinned after baptism was in many places permanently excluded
from the Church (<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Heb. 10:26, 27), or the community
of those whose sins had been forgiven and were
certain of heaven. By the middle of the second century the
practice at Rome tended toward permitting one readmission
after suitable penance (<ref target="Section_42_a"><hi rend='italic'>a</hi></ref>).
After this the penitential discipline
developed rapidly and became an important part of the
business of the local congregation
(<ref target="Section_42_b"><hi rend='italic'>b</hi></ref>). The sinner, by a long
course of self-mortification and prayer, obtained the desired
readmission (<ref target="Section_42_c"><hi rend='italic'>c</hi></ref>).
The Montanists, however, in accord with
their general rigorism, would make it extremely hard, if not
impossible, to obtain readmission or forgiveness. The body
of the Church, and certainly the Roman church under the
lead of its bishop, who relied upon Matt. 16:18, adopted a
more liberal policy and granted forgiveness on relatively easy
terms to even the worst offenders
(<ref target="Section_42_d"><hi rend='italic'>d</hi></ref>). The discipline grew
less severe, because martyrs or confessors, according to Matt.
10:20, were regarded as having the Spirit, and therefore
competent to speak for God and announce the divine
forgiveness. These were accustomed to give <q>letters of peace,</q>
which were commonly regarded as sufficient to procure the
immediate readmission of the offender
(<ref target="Section_42_e"><hi rend='italic'>e</hi></ref>), a practice which
led to great abuse. One of the effects of the development
of the penitential discipline was the establishment of a distinction
between mortal and venial sins
(<ref target="Section_42_f"><hi rend='italic'>f</hi></ref>), the former of
which were, in general, acts involving unchastity, shedding of
blood, and apostasy, according to the current interpretation
of Acts 15:29.

The Lord, therefore, being merciful, has had mercy on the

has intrusted to me the power over this repentance. And
therefore I say unto you that if any one is tempted by the
devil, and sins after that great and holy calling in which the
Lord has called His people to everlasting life, he has opportunity
to repent but once. But if he should sin frequently
after this, and then repent, to such a man his repentance will

as a shipwrecked man embraces the protection of some
plank. This will draw you forth when sunk in the waves

clemency.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 9. The narrower the sphere of action of this, the second
and only remaining repentance, the more laborious is
its probation; that it may not be exhibited in the conscience
alone, but may likewise be performed in some act. This act,
which is more usually expressed and commonly spoken of
under the Greek name, exomologesis, whereby we confess our
sins to the Lord, not indeed to Him as ignorant of them,
but inasmuch as by confession a satisfaction is made; of confession
repentance is born; by repentance God is appeased.
And thus exomologesis is a discipline for man's prostration and
humiliation, enjoining a demeanor calculated to move mercy.
With regard, also, to the very dress and food, it commands
one to lie in sackcloth and ashes, to cover the body as in
mourning, to lay the spirit low in sorrow, to exchange for
severe treatment the sins which he has committed; furthermore,
to permit as food and drink only what is plain—not
for the stomach's sake, but for the soul's; for the most part,
however, to feed prayers on fastings, to groan, to weep, and
make outcries unto the Lord our God; to fall prostrate
before the presbyters and to kneel to God's dear ones; to
enjoin on all the brethren to be ambassadors to bear his
deprecatory supplication before God. All this exomologesis
does, that it may enhance repentance, that it may honor the
Lord by fear of danger, may, by itself, in pronouncing against
the sinner stand in place of God's indignation, and by temporal
mortification (I will not say frustrate, but rather)
expunge eternal punishments.

Ch. 1. I hear that there has been an edict set forth, and,
indeed, a peremptory one; namely, that the Pontifex Maximus,
the bishop of bishops, issues an edict: <q>I remit to such as
have performed penance, the sins both of adultery and fornication.</q>

sins, but I will not do it, lest they commit still others.</q>…
I now inquire into your opinion, to discover from what
source you usurp this power to the Church.
</p>

<p>
If, because the Lord said to Peter, <q>Upon this rock I will
build My Church [Matt. 16:18].… To Thee I have given
the keys of the kingdom of heaven,</q> or <q>Whatsoever thou
shalt bind or loose on earth, shall be bound or loosed in
heaven,</q> you therefore presume that the power of binding
and loosing has descended to you, that is, to every church
akin to Peter; what sort of man, then, are you, subverting
and wholly changing the manifest intention of the Lord, who
conferred the gift personally upon Peter? <q>On Thee,</q> He
says, <q>I will build my Church,</q> and <q>I will give thee the
keys,</q> not to the Church; and <q>whatsoever thou shalt
have loosed or bound,</q> not what they shall have loosed or
bound. For so the result actually teaches. In him (Peter)
the Church was reared, that is, through him (Peter) himself;
he himself tried the key; you see what key: <q>Men of Israel, let
what I say sink into your ears; Jesus, the Nazarene, a man
appointed of God for you,</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Cf.</hi>
Acts 2:22.</note> and so forth. Peter himself,
therefore, was the first to unbar, in Christ's baptism, the
entrance to the kingdom of heaven, in which are loosed the
sins that aforetime were bound.…

<pb n='187'/><anchor id='Pg187'/>

<p>
What, now, has this to do with the Church and your
Church, indeed, O Psychic? For in accordance with the person
of Peter, it is to spiritual men that this power will correspondingly
belong, either to an Apostle or else to a prophet.…
And accordingly the <q>Church,</q> it is true, will forgive
sins; but it will be the Church of the Spirit, by a spiritual
man; not the Church which consists of a number of bishops.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 22. But you go so far as to lavish this power upon
martyrs indeed; so that no sooner has any one, acting on a
preconceived arrangement, put on soft bonds in the nominal
custody now in vogue, than adulterers beset him, fornicators
gain access to him; instantly prayers resound about him;
instantly pools of tears of the polluted surround him; nor are
there any who are more diligent in purchasing entrance to the
prison than they who have lost the fellowship of the Church.…
Whatever authority, whatever reason, restores ecclesiastical
peace to the adulterer and the fornicator, the same
will be bound to come to the aid of the murderer and the
idolater in their repentance.

We ourselves do not forget the distinction between sins,

speaking evil; or rashly swearing; or forfeiting his plighted
word; or lying from bashfulness or necessity? In business, in
official duties, in trade, in food, in sight, in hearing, by how
great temptations are we assailed! So that if there were no
pardon for such simple sins as these, salvation would be unattainable
by any. Of these, then, there will be pardon
through the successful Intercessor with the Father, Christ.
But there are other sins wholly different from these, graver
and more destructive, such as are incapable of pardon—murder,
idolatry, fraud, apostasy, blasphemy, and, of course,
adultery and fornication and whatever other violation of the
temple of God there may be. For these Christ will no more
be the successful Intercessor; these will not at all be committed

<head>§ 43. The Catechetical School of Alexandria: Clement and Origen</head>

<p>
Three types of theology developed in the ante-Nicene
Church: the Asia Minor school, best represented by Irenæus
(<hi rend='italic'>v.</hi> <ref target="Section_33">§ 33</ref>); the North
African, represented by Tertullian and Cyprian
(<hi rend='italic'>v.</hi> <ref target="Section_39">§ 39</ref>); and the
Alexandrian, in the Catechetical
School of which Clement and Origen were the most distinguished
members. In the Alexandrian theology the tradition
of the apologists (<hi rend='italic'>v.</hi> <ref target="Section_32">§ 32</ref>)
that Christianity was a revealed philosophy was continued, especially by Clement. Origen,
following the bent of his genius, developed other sides of
Christian thought as well, bringing it all into a more systematic
form than had ever before been attempted. The
Catechetical School of Alexandria was the most celebrated of
all the educational institutions of Christian antiquity. It
aimed to give a general secular and religious training. It
appears to have been in existence well before the end of the
second century, having been founded, it is thought, by Pantænus.
Clement assisted in the instruction from 190, and
from about 200 was head of the school for a few years. In
202 or 203 he was forced by persecution under Septimius
Severus to flee from the city. He died before 215. Of his
works, the most important is his three-part treatise composed
of his <hi rend='italic'>Protrepticus</hi>, an apologetic work addressed to the Greeks;
his <hi rend='italic'>Pædegogus</hi>, a treatise on Christian morality; and his
<hi rend='italic'>Stromata</hi>, or miscellanies. Origen became head of the Catechetical
School in 203, when but eighteen years old, and
remained in that position until 232, when, having been irregularly
ordained priest outside his own diocese and being suspected
of heresy, he was deposed. But he removed to Cæsarea
in Palestine, where he continued his work with the greatest
success and was held in the highest honor by the Church in
Palestine and parts other than Egypt. He died 254 or 255 at
Tyre, having previously suffered severely in the Decian persecution.
<pb n='190'/><anchor id='Pg190'/>
His works are of the highest importance in various
fields of theology. <hi rend='italic'>De Principiis</hi> is the first attempt to present
in connected form the whole range of Christian theology.
His commentaries cover nearly the entire Bible. His <hi rend='italic'>Contra

was the most elaborate piece of text-criticism of antiquity.

therefore, was a preparation, paving the way for him who is

<quote rend="display">
See Clement of Alexandria, <hi rend='italic'>VIIth Book of the Stromateis</hi>, ed.
by Hort and Mayor, London, 1902. In making faith suffice for salvation,
Clement clearly distinguishes his position from that of the Gnostics,
though he uses the term <q>gnostic</q> as applicable to Christians. See
next passage.
</quote>

<p>
Knowledge [gnosis], so to speak, is a perfecting of man as
man, which is brought about by acquaintance with divine
things; in character, life, and word harmonious and consistent
with itself and the divine Word. For by it faith is
made perfect, inasmuch as it is solely by it that the man of
faith becomes perfect. Faith is an internal good, and without
searching for God confesses His existence and glorifies Him
as existent. Hence by starting with this faith, and being
developed by it, through the grace of God, the knowledge
respecting Him is to be acquired as far as possible.…
</p>

<p>
But it is not doubting, in reference to God, but believing,
that is the foundation of knowledge. But Christ is both the
foundation and the superstructure, by whom are both the
beginning and the end. And the extreme points, the beginning
and the end, I mean faith and love, are not taught.
But knowledge, which is conveyed from communication
through the grace of God as a deposit, is intrusted to those
who show themselves worthy of it; and from it the worth
of love beams forth from light to light. For it is said, <q>To
him that hath shall be given</q> [<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Matt. 13:12]—to faith,
knowledge; and to knowledge, love; and to love, the inheritance.…
</p>

<p>
Faith then is, so to speak, a compendious knowledge of the
essentials; but knowledge is the sure and firm demonstration
of what is received by faith, built upon faith by the Lord's
teaching, conveying us on to unshaken conviction and certainty.
And, as it seems to me, the first saving change is that
from heathenism to faith, as I said before; and the second,
that from faith to knowledge. And this latter passing on to
<pb n='192'/><anchor id='Pg192'/>
love, thereafter gives a mutual friendship between that which
knows and that which is known. And perhaps he who has
already arrived at this stage has attained equality with the
angels. At any rate, after he has reached the final ascent in
the flesh, he still continues to advance, as is fit, and presses
on through the holy Hebdomad into the Father's house, to
that which is indeed the Lord's abode.

The sacrifice acceptable with God is unchanging alienation
from the body and its passions. This is the really true piety.
And is not philosophy, therefore, rightly called by Socrates
the meditation on death? For he who neither employs his
eyes in the exercise of thought nor draws from his other
senses, but with pure mind applies himself to objects, practises
the true philosophy.…

It is not without reason, therefore, that in the mysteries
which are to be found among the Greeks lustrations hold
the first place; as also the laver among the barbarians.
After these are the minor mysteries, which have some foundation
for instruction and preparation for what is to follow.
In the great mysteries concerning the universe nothing
remains to be learned, but only to contemplate and comprehend
with the mind nature and things. We shall understand
the more of purification by confession, and of contemplation
by analysis, advancing by analysis to the first notion,
beginning with the properties underlying it; abstracting from
the body its physical properties, taking away the dimension of
depth, then of breadth, and then of length. For the point
which remains is a unit, so to speak, having position; from
which, if we abstract position, there is the conception of unity.
</p>

<p>
If, then, we abstract all that belongs to bodies and things
called incorporeal, we cast ourselves into the greatness of
Christ, and thence advancing into immensity by holiness, we
<pb n='193'/><anchor id='Pg193'/>
may reach somehow to the conception of the Almighty, knowing
not what He is, but knowing what He is not. And form
and motion, or standing, or a throne or place, or right hand or
left, are not at all to be conceived as belonging to the Father
of the universe, although it is so written. For what each of
these signifies will be shown in the proper place. The First
Cause is not then in space, but above time and space and
name and conception.

Origen's doctrine of the <q>eternal generation of the Son</q> was of
primary importance in all subsequent discussions on the Trinity.

<p>
Let no one imagine that we mean anything unsubstantial
when we call Him the Wisdom of God; or suppose, for example,
that we understand Him to be, not a living being endowed
with wisdom, but something which makes men wise,
giving itself to, and implanting itself in, the minds of those
who are made capable of receiving its virtues and intelligence.
If, then, it is once rightly understood that the only
begotten Son of God is His Wisdom hypostatically [substantialiter]
existing, I know not whether our mind ought to
advance beyond this or entertain any suspicion that the
hypostasis or substantia contains anything of a bodily nature,
since everything corporeal is distinguished either by form, or
color, or magnitude. And who in his sound senses ever
sought for form, or color, or size, in wisdom, in respect of its
being wisdom? And who that is capable of entertaining reverential
thoughts or feelings regarding God can suppose or
believe that God the Father ever existed, even for a moment of
time, without having generated this Wisdom? For in that
case he must say either that God was unable to generate
Wisdom before He produced her, so that He afterward
called into being that which formerly did not exist, or that
He could, but—what is impious to say of God—was unwilling
to generate; both of which suppositions, it is patent to all,
are alike absurd and impious: for they amount to this,
<pb n='194'/><anchor id='Pg194'/>
either that God advanced from a condition of inability to one
of ability, or that, although possessed of the power, He
concealed it, and delayed the generation of Wisdom. Therefore
we have always held that God is the Father of His only
begotten Son, who was born indeed of Him, and derives from
Him, what He is, but without any beginning, not only such
as may be measured by any divisions of time, but even that
which the mind alone contemplates within itself, or beholds,
so to speak, with the naked soul and understanding. And
therefore we must believe that Wisdom was generated before
any beginning that can be either comprehended or expressed.

risen from a lower to a higher condition; since there can be
no doubt that it is better for Him to be omnipotent than not
to be so. And, now, how can it appear otherwise than absurd,

We have frequently shown by those statements which we
are able to adduce from the divine Scriptures that God, the
Creator of all things, is good, and just, and all-powerful.
When in the beginning He created all those beings whom He
desired to create, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, rational natures, He had no other
reason for creating them than on account of Himself, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>,
His goodness. As He himself, then, was the cause of the
existence of those things which were to be created, in whom
there was neither any variation nor change nor want of power,
He created all whom He made equal and alike, because there
was no reason for Him to produce variety and diversity.
But since those rational creatures themselves, as we have
frequently shown and will yet show in the proper place, were
endowed with the power of free choice, this freedom of his
will incited each one either to progress by imitation of God or
induced him to failure through negligence. And this, as we
have already stated, is the cause of the diversity among
rational creatures, deriving its origin not from the will or
judgment of the Creator, but from the freedom of the individual
will. God, however, who deemed it just to arrange
His creatures according to merit, brought down these differences
<pb n='196'/><anchor id='Pg196'/>
of understanding into the harmony of one world, that
He might adorn, as it were, one dwelling, in which there
ought to be not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of
wood and clay and some, indeed, to honor and others to dishonor,
with those different vessels, or souls, or understandings.
And these are the causes, in my opinion, why that
world presents the aspect of diversity, while Divine Providence
continues to regulate each individual according to the variety
of his movements or of his feelings and purpose. On which
account the Creator will neither appear to be unjust in distributing
(for the causes already mentioned) to every one
according to his merits; nor will the happiness or unhappiness
of each one's birth, or whatever be the condition that
falls to his lot, be deemed accidental; nor will different creators,
or souls of different natures, be believed to exist.

devil was developed by Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory the Great,
and reappeared constantly in theology down to the scholastic period,

If we consider Jesus in relation to the divinity that was in
Him, the things which He did in this capacity are holy and do
not offend our idea of God; and if we consider Him as a man,
distinguished beyond all others by an intimate communion
with the very Word, with Absolute Wisdom, He suffered as
one who was wise and perfect whatever it behooved Him to
suffer, who did all for the good of the human race, yea, even
for the good of all intelligent beings. And there is nothing
absurd in the fact that a man died, and that his death was not
only an example of death endured for the sake of piety, but
also the first blow in the conflict which is to overthrow the
power of the evil spirit of the devil, who had obtained dominion
over the whole world. For there are signs of the destruction
of his empire; namely, those who through the coming of
Christ are everywhere escaping from the power of demons,
and who after their deliverance from this bondage in which
they were held consecrate themselves to God, and according
to their ability devote themselves day by day to advancement
in a life of piety.

He did this in service of our salvation so far that He gave
His soul a ransom for many who believed on Him. If all
had believed on Him, He would have given His soul as a
ransom for all. To whom did He give His soul as a ransom
for many? Certainly not to God. Then was it not to the
Evil One? For that one reigned over us until the soul of
Jesus was given as a ransom for us. This he had especially
demanded, deceived by the imagination that he could rule
over it, and he was not mindful of the fact that he could not
endure the torment connected with holding it fast. Therefore
<pb n='198'/><anchor id='Pg198'/>
death, which appeared to reign over Him, did not reign
over Him, since He was <q>free among the dead</q> and stronger
than the power of death. He is, indeed, so far superior to it
that all who from among those overcome by death will
follow Him can follow Him, as death is unable to do anything
against them.… We are therefore redeemed with the
precious blood of Jesus. As a ransom for us the soul of the
Son of God has been given (not His spirit, for this, according
to Luke [<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Luke 23:46] He had previously given to His
Father, saying: <q>Father, into Thy hands I commit my spirit</q>);
also, not His body, for concerning this we find nothing mentioned.
And when He had given His soul as a ransom for
many, He did not remain in the power of him to whom the ransom
was given for many, because it says in the sixteenth
psalm [Psalm 16:10]: <q>Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell.</q>

It is to be borne in mind, however, that certain beings
who fell away from that one beginning of which we have
spoken, have given themselves to such wickedness and malice
as to be deemed altogether undeserving of that training and
instruction by which the human race while in the flesh are
trained and instructed with the assistance of the heavenly
powers: they continue, on the contrary, in a state of enmity
and opposition to those who are receiving this instruction
and teaching. And hence it is that the whole life of mortals
is full of certain struggles and trials, caused by the opposition
and enmity against us of those who fell from a better condition
without at all looking back, and who are called the
devil and his angels, and other orders of evil, which the Apostle
classed among the opposing powers. But whether any of
these orders, who act under the government of the devil
and obey his wicked commands, will be able in a future world
to be converted to righteousness because of their possessing
the faculty of freedom of will, or whether persistent and
<pb n='199'/><anchor id='Pg199'/>
inveterate wickedness may be changed by habit into a kind
of nature, you, reader, may decide; yet so that neither in
those things which are seen and temporal nor in those which
are unseen and eternal one portion is to differ wholly from
the final unity and fitness of things. But in the meantime,
both in those temporal worlds which are seen, and in those
eternal worlds which are invisible, all those beings are
arranged according to a regular plan, in the order and degree
of merit; so that some of them in the first, others in the
second, some even in the last times, after having undergone
heavier and severer punishments, endured for a lengthened
period and for many ages, so to speak, improved by this stern
method of training, and restored at first by the instruction
of angels and subsequently advanced by powers of a higher
grade, and thus advancing through each stage to a better
condition, reach even to that which is invisible and eternal,
having travelled by a kind of training through every single
office of the heavenly powers. From which, I think, this will
follow as an inference—that every rational nature can, in
passing from one order to another, go through each to all,
and advance from all to each, while made the subject of various
degrees of proficiency and failure, according to its own actions
and endeavors, put forth in the enjoyment of its power of
freedom of will.

Ch. 9. Now the cause, in all the points previously enumerated,
of the false opinions and of the impious statements
<pb n='200'/><anchor id='Pg200'/>
or ignorant assertions about God appears to be nothing else
than that the Scriptures are not understood according to
their spiritual meaning, but are interpreted according to the
mere letter. And therefore to those who believe that the
sacred books are not the compositions of men, but were composed
by the inspirations of the Holy Spirit, according to
the will of the Father of all things through Jesus Christ, and
that they have come down to us, we must point out the modes
of interpretation which appear correct to us, who cling to
the standard of the heavenly Church according to the succession
of the Apostles of Jesus Christ. Now that there are
certain mystical economies made known in the Holy Scriptures,
all, even the most simple of those who adhere to the
word, have believed; but what these are, the candid and
modest confess they know not. If, then, one were to be perplexed
about the incest of Lot with his daughters, and about
the two wives of Abraham, and the two sisters married to
Jacob, and the two handmaids who bore him children, they
can return no other answer than this—that these are mysteries
not understood by us.…
</p>

<p>
Ch. 11. The way, then, as it seems to me, in which we ought
to deal with the Scriptures and extract from them their
meaning is the following, which has been ascertained from
the sayings [of the Scriptures] themselves. By Solomon in
the Proverbs we find some rule as this enjoined respecting
the teaching of the divine writings, <q>And do thou portray
them in a threefold manner, in counsel and knowledge, to
answer words of truth to them who propose them to thee</q>
[<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Prov. 22:20 <hi rend='italic'>f.</hi>, LXX].
One ought, then, to portray
the ideas of Holy Scripture in a threefold manner upon his
soul, in order that the simple man may be edified by the
<q>flesh,</q> as it were, of Scripture, for so we name the obvious
sense; while he who has ascended a certain way may be edified
by the <q>soul,</q> as it were. The perfect man, and he who
resembles those spoken of by the Apostle, when he says,
<q>We speak wisdom among them that are perfect, but not
<pb n='201'/><anchor id='Pg201'/>
the wisdom of the world, nor of the rulers of this world, who
come to nought; but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery,
the hidden wisdom, which God hath ordained before
the ages unto our glory</q> [I Cor. 2:6, 7], may receive edification
from the spiritual law, which was a shadow of things
to come. For as man consists of body and soul and spirit,
so in the same way does the Scripture consist, which has
been arranged by God for the salvation of men.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 12. But as there are certain passages which do not
contain at all the <q>corporeal</q> sense, as we shall show in the
following, there are also places where we must seek only for
the <q>soul,</q> as it were, and <q>spirit</q> of Scripture.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 15. But since, if the usefulness of the legislation and
the sequence and beauty of the history were universally
evident, we should not believe that any other thing could
be understood in the Scriptures save what was obvious, the
Word of God has arranged that certain stumbling-blocks,
and offences, and impossibilities, should be introduced into
the midst of the law and the history, in order that we may not,
through being drawn away in all directions by the merely
attractive nature of the language, either altogether fall away
from the true doctrines, as learning nothing worthy of God,
or, by not departing from the letter, come to the knowledge
of nothing more divine. And this, also, we must know: that,
since the principal aim is to announce the <q>spiritual</q> connection
in those things that are done and that ought to be done
where the Word found that things done according to the
history could be adapted to these mystic senses, He made use
of them, concealing from the multitude the deeper meaning;
but where in the narrative of the development of super-sensual
things there did not follow the performance of those
certain events which was already indicated by the mystical
meaning the Scripture interwove in the history the account
of some event that did not take place, sometimes what
could not have happened; sometimes what could, but did
not happen.… And at other times impossibilities are
<pb n='202'/><anchor id='Pg202'/>
recorded for the sake of the more skilful and inquisitive,
in order that they may give themselves to the toil of investigation
of what is written, and thus attain to a becoming
conviction of the manner in which a meaning worthy of God
must be sought out in such subjects.

<head>§ 44. Neo-Platonism</head>

<p>
The last phase of Hellenic philosophy was religious. It
aimed to combine the principles of many schools of the earlier
period and to present a metaphysical system that would at
once give a theory of being and also furnish a philosophical
basis for the new religious life. This final philosophy of the
antique world was Neo-Platonism. It was thoroughly eclectic
in its treatment of earlier systems, but under Plotinus
attained no small degree of consistency. The emphasis was
laid especially upon the religious problems, and in the system
it may be fairly said that the religious aspirations of heathenism
found their highest and purest expression. Because it
was in close touch with current culture and in its metaphysical
principles was closely akin to the philosophy of the Church
teachers, we find Neo-Platonism sometimes a bitter rival of
Christianity, at other times a preparation for the Christian
faith, as in the case of Augustine and Victorinus.

Ch. 16. You will honor God best when you form your
soul to resemble him. This likeness is only by virtue; for
only virtue draws the soul upward toward its own kind.
There is nothing greater with God than virtue; but God is
greater than virtue. But God strengthens him who does what
is good; but of evil deeds a wicked demon is the instigator.
Therefore the wicked soul flees from God and wishes that the
foreknowledge of God did not exist; and from the divine law
which punishes all wickedness it shrinks away completely.
But a wise man's soul is in harmony with God, ever sees Him,
ever is with Him. But if that which rules takes pleasure in
that which is ruled, then God cares for the wise and provides
for him; and therefore is the wise man blessed, because he is
under the protection of God. It is not the discourses of the
wise man which are honorable before God, but his works; for
the wise man, even when he keeps silence, honors God, but
the ignorant man, even in praying and sacrificing, dishonors
the Divinity. So the wise man alone is a priest, alone is
dear to God, alone knows how to pray.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 17. He who practises wisdom practises the knowledge
of God; though not always in prayer and sacrifice, practising
piety toward God by his works. For a man is not
rendered agreeable to God by ruling himself according to the
prejudices of men and the vain declamations of the sophists.
It is the man himself who, by his own works, renders himself
agreeable to God, and is deified by the conforming of his own
soul to the incorruptible blessed One. And it is he himself
who makes himself impious and displeasing to God, not
suffering evil from God, for the Divinity does only what is
good. It is the man himself who causes his evils by his false
beliefs in regard to God. The impious is not so much he
who does not honor the statues of the gods as he who mixes
<pb n='204'/><anchor id='Pg204'/>
up with the idea of God the superstitions of the vulgar. As
for thyself, do not hold any unworthy idea of God, of his
blessedness or of his incorruptibility.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 18. The greatest fruit of piety is this—to honor the
Deity according to our fatherland; not that He has need of
anything, but His holy and happy Majesty invites us to
offer Him our homage. Altars consecrated to God do no harm,
and when neglected they render no help. But he who honors
God as needing anything declares, without knowing it, that
he is superior to God. Therefore it is not angering God
that harms us, but not knowing God, for wrath is alien to
God, because it is the product of the involuntary, and there
is nothing involuntary in God. Do not then dishonor the
Divinity by human false opinions, for thou wilt not thereby
injure the Being enjoying eternal blessedness, from whose
incorruptible nature every injury is repelled.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 19. But thou shouldest not think that I say these
things when I exhort to the worship of God; for he who
exhorts to this would be ridiculous; as if it were possible to
doubt concerning this; and we do not worship Him aright
doing this thing or thinking that about
God.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>I.e.</hi>, it is not certain rites
nor certain beliefs that give merit to our worship.</note> Neither
tears nor supplications turn God from His purpose; nor do
sacrifices honor God, nor the multitude of offerings glorify
God, but the godlike mind well governed enters into union
with God. For like is of necessity joined to like. But the
victims of the senseless crowd are food for the flames, and
their offerings are the supplies for a licentious life to the
plunderers of temples. But, as I have said to thee, let the
mind within thee be the temple of God. This must be
tended and adorned to become a fit dwelling for God.

<head>Chapter III. The First General Persecution And Its Consequences</head>

<p>
On account of various principles of the Roman law, Christians
were always liable to severe penalties, and parts of the
Church occasionally suffered fearfully. But it was only in
exceptional cases and sporadically that the laws were enforced.
There was, accordingly, no prolonged and systematic
effort made to put down Christianity everywhere until the
reign of Decius (249-251). The renewed interest in heathen
religions and the revived patriotism in some circles occasioned
in 248 by the celebration of the thousandth anniversary of
the founding of Rome may have contributed to a renewal of
hostilities against the Church. Decius undertook the military
defence of the frontier. His colleague, Valerian, had
charge of the internal affairs of the Empire and was the
author of the measures against the Christians. Because the
Church included many who had embraced the faith in the
long period when the Church rarely felt the severity of the
laws, many were unable to endure the persecution, and so
apostatized or <q>fell.</q> The persecution continued only for a
short time in full intensity, but it was not abandoned for a
number of years. It became violent once more when Valerian
became Emperor (253-260). One result of the persecutions
was the rise of serious disputes, and even schisms, from differences
regarding the administration of discipline by the bishops.
In the case of the Novatians at Rome, a dissenting Church
which spread rapidly over the Empire came into existence
and lasted for more than two centuries.

<head>§ 45. The Decian-Valerian Persecution</head>

<p>
The first persecution which may fairly be said to have been
general in purpose and effect was that falling in the reigns
of Decius (249-251) and Valerian (253-260). Of the course
of the persecution we have information bearing directly upon
Carthage, Alexandria, and Asia Minor. But it probably was
felt very generally throughout the Church.

That it is not the fear of external enemies which strengthens
our union is plain from the fact that this cause, by God's
will, has already ceased for a considerable time. And it is
probable that the secure existence, so far as this life is concerned,
which is enjoyed by believers at present will come
to an end, since those who in every way calumniate the
Word [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, Christianity] are again attributing the frequency
of rebellion to the multitude of believers and to their not
being persecuted by the authorities, as in former times.

<quote rend="display">
Lucius Cælius Firminianus Lactantius was of African birth. Having
obtained some local fame as a teacher of rhetoric, he was appointed
by Diocletian professor of that subject in his new capital of Nicomedia.
This position Lactantius lost during the Diocletian persecution.
He was afterward tutor of Crispus, the son of Constantine. His
work <hi rend='italic'>On the Death of the Persecutors</hi> is written in a
bitter spirit, but
excellent style. Although in some circles it has been customary to
impeach the veracity of Lactantius, no intentional departure from
historical truthfulness, apart from rhetorical coloring, which was
<pb n='207'/><anchor id='Pg207'/>
inevitable, has been proved against him. Of late there has been some
doubt as to the authorship of <hi rend='italic'>De Mortibus Persecutorum</hi>.

<p>
Ch. 3. … This long peace, however, was afterward
interrupted.

<p>
Ch. 4. For after many years there appeared in the world
an accursed wild beast, Decius by name, who should afflict
the Church. And who but a bad man would persecute
righteousness? As if for this end he had been raised up to
sovereign eminence, he began at once to rage against God,
and at once to fall. For having undertaken an expedition
against the Carpi, who had then occupied Dacia and Mœsia,
he was suddenly surrounded by the barbarians, and slain, together
with a great part of his army; nor could he be honored
with the rights of sepulture, but, stripped and naked, he lay as
food for wild beasts and birds, as became the enemy of God.

The Decian persecution and the sufferings of Origen.
</quote>

<p>
Decius succeeded Philip, who had reigned seven years.
On account of his hatred of Philip, Decius commenced a persecution
of the churches, in which Fabianus suffered martyrdom
at Rome, and Cornelius succeeded him in the episcopate.
In Palestine, Alexander, bishop of the church of Jerusalem,
was brought again on Christ's account before the governor's
judgment seat in Cæsarea, and having acquitted himself nobly
in a second confession, was cast into prison, crowned with the
hoary locks of venerable age. And after his honorable and
illustrious confession at the tribunal of the governor, he fell
asleep in prison, and Mazabanes became his successor in the
bishopric of Jerusalem. Babylas in Antioch having, like
Alexander, passed away in prison after his confession, Fabius
presided over that church.
</p>

<p>
But how many and how great things came upon Origen
in the persecution, and what was their final result—as the
evil demon marshalled all his forces and fought against the
man with his utmost craft and power, assaulting him beyond
<pb n='208'/><anchor id='Pg208'/>
all others against whom he contended at that time; and
what and how many things the man endured for the word
of Christ—bonds and bodily tortures and torments under the
iron collar and in the dungeon; and how for many days with
his feet stretched four spaces of the stocks he bore patiently
the threats of fire and whatever other things were inflicted
by his enemies; and how his sufferings terminated, as his
judge strove eagerly with all his might not to end his life;
and what words he left after these things full of comfort to
those needing aid, a great many of his epistles show with
truth and accuracy.

Ch. 8. From some, alas, all these things have fallen away,
and have passed from memory. They indeed did not even
wait, that, having been apprehended, they should go up, or,
having been interrogated, they might deny. Many were
conquered before the battle, prostrated without an attack.
Nor did they even leave it to be said for them that they seemed
to sacrifice to idols unwillingly. They ran to the forum of
their own accord; freely they hastened to death, as if they
had formerly wished it, as if they would embrace an opportunity
now given which they had always desired. How
many were put off by the magistrates at that time, when
evening was coming on! How many even asked that their
destruction might not be delayed! What violence can such
a one plead, how can he purge his crime, when it was he himself
who rather used force that he might perish? When they
came voluntarily to the capitol—when they freely approached
to the obedience of the terrible wickedness—did not their
<pb n='209'/><anchor id='Pg209'/>
tread falter, did not their sight darken, their hearts tremble,
their arms fall helplessly down, their senses become dull,
their tongues cleave to their mouths, their speech fail? Could
the servant of God stand there, he who had already renounced
the devil and the world, and speak and renounce Christ?
Was not that altar, whither he drew near to die, to him a
funeral pile? Ought he not to shudder at, and flee from,
the altar of the devil, which he had seen to smoke and to be
redolent of a foul stench, as it were, a funeral and sepulchre
of his life? Why bring with you, O wretched man, a sacrifice?
Why immolate a victim? You yourself have come to the
altar an offering, yourself a victim; there you have immolated
your salvation, your hope; there you have burned up your
faith in those deadly fires.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 9. But to many their own destruction was not sufficient.
With mutual exhortations the people were urged to their ruin;
death was pledged by turns in the deadly cup. And that
nothing might be wanting to aggravate the crime, infants, also,
in the arms of their parents, being either carried or conducted,
lost, while yet little ones, what in the very beginning of their
nativity they had gained. Will not they, when the day of
judgment comes, say: <q>We have done nothing; nor have we
forsaken the Lord's bread and cup to hasten freely to a
profane contract.…</q>
</p>

<p>
Ch. 10. Nor is there, alas, any just and weighty reason
which excuses such a crime. One's country was to be left,
and loss of one's estate was to be suffered. Yet to whom
that is born and dies is there not a necessity at some time
to leave his country and to suffer loss of his estate? But let
not Christ be forsaken, so that the loss of salvation and of
an eternal home should be feared.

<p>
Cyprian to his brother Successus, greeting. The reason why
I write to you at once, dearest brother, is that all the clergy
are placed in the heat of the contest and are unable in any
way to depart hence, for all of them are prepared, in accordance
with the devotion of their mind, for divine and heavenly
glory. But you should know that those have come back
whom I sent to Rome to find out and bring us the truth
concerning what had in any manner been decreed respecting
us. For many, various, and uncertain things are currently
reported. But the truth concerning them is as follows:
Valerian has sent a rescript to the Senate, to the effect that
bishops, presbyters, and deacons should be immediately
punished; but that senators, men of rank, and Roman
knights should lose their dignity and be deprived of their
property; and if, when their property has been taken away,
they should persist in being Christians, that they should
then also lose their heads; but that matrons should be deprived
of their property and banished. Moreover, people
of Cæsar's household, who had either confessed before or
should now confess, should have their property confiscated,
and be sent in chains and assigned to Cæsar's estates. The
Emperor Valerian also added to his address a copy of the
letters he prepared for the presidents of the provinces coercing
us. These letters we are daily hoping will come, and we are
waiting, according to the strength of our faith, for the endurance
of suffering and expecting from the help and mercy of
the Lord the crown of eternal life. But know that Sixtus
was punished [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, martyred] in the cemetery on the eighth
day of the ides of August, and with him four deacons. The
prefects of the city, furthermore, are daily urging on this
persecution; so that if any are presented to them they are
punished and their property confiscated.
</p>

<p>
I beg that these things be made known by you to the rest
of our colleagues, that everywhere by their exhortations the
brotherhood may be strengthened and prepared for the
spiritual conflict, that every one may think less of death than
<pb n='212'/><anchor id='Pg212'/>
of immortality, and dedicated to the Lord with full faith and
courage, they may rejoice rather than fear in this confession,
wherein they know that the soldiers of God and Christ are
not slain, but crowned. I bid you, dearest brother, ever
farewell in the Lord.

<head>§ 46. Effects of the Persecution upon the Inner Life
of the Church</head>

<p>
The persecution developed the popular opinion of the
superior sanctity of martyrdom. This was itself no new
idea, having grown up in the Church from the time of Ignatius
of Antioch, but it now received new applications and developments
(<ref target="Section_46_a"><hi rend='italic'>a</hi></ref>,
<ref target="Section_46_b"><hi rend='italic'>b</hi></ref>). See also
<ref target="Section_42_d">§ 42, <hi rend='italic'>d</hi></ref>, and below for problems
arising from the place the martyrs attempted to take in the
organization of the Church and the administration of discipline.
This claim of the martyrs was successfully overcome
by the bishops, especially under Cyprian's leadership and
example. But in the administration of discipline there were
sure to arise difficulties and questions, <hi rend='italic'>e.g.</hi>,
Was there a distinction to be made in favor of those who had escaped without
actually sacrificing? (<ref target="Section_46_c"><hi rend='italic'>c</hi></ref>).
No matter what policy was followed
by the bishop, there was the liability of the rise of a party
in opposition to him. If he was strict, a party advocating
laxity appeared, as in the case of Felicissimus at Carthage;
if he was milder in policy, a party would call for greater rigor,
as in the case of Novatian at Rome
(<ref target="Section_46_e"><hi rend='italic'>e</hi></ref>).

Ch. 30. We must remember that we have sinned and that
it is impossible to obtain forgiveness of sins without baptism,
and that according to the evangelical laws it is impossible
to be baptized a second time with water and the Spirit for
the forgiveness of sins, and therefore the baptism of martyrdom
is given us. For thus it has been called, as may be
clearly gathered from the passage: <q>Can ye drink of the
cup that I drink of, and be baptized with the baptism that
I am baptized with?</q> [Mark 10:38]. And in another place
it is said: <q>But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and
how am I straightened until it be accomplished!</q> [Luke 12:50].
For be sure that just as the expiation of the cross was
for the whole world, it (the baptism of martyrdom) is for the
cure of many who are thereby cleansed. For as according to
the law of Moses those placed near the altar are seen to
minister forgiveness of sins to others through the blood of
bulls and goats, so the souls of those who have suffered on
account of the testimony of Jesus are not in vain near that
altar in heaven [<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Rev. 6:9
<hi rend='italic'>ff.</hi>], but minister forgiveness of
sins to those who pray. And at the same time we know that
just as the high priest, Jesus Christ, offered himself as a
sacrifice, so the priests, of whom He is the high priest, offer
themselves as sacrifices, and on account of this sacrifice they
are at the altar as in their proper place.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 50. Just as we have been redeemed with the precious
blood of Christ, who received the name that is above every
name, so by the precious blood of the martyrs will others be
redeemed.

inasmuch as there are made no martyrs, and sacrifices of saints

it may happen to us what the Jews said of themselves, that

Since there is much difference between those who have

Ch. 2. It has appeared whence came the faction of Felicissimus,
on what root and by what strength it stood. These
men supplied in a former time encouragements and exhortations
to confessors, not to agree with their bishop, not to
maintain the ecclesiastical discipline faithfully and quietly,
according to the Lord's precepts, not to keep the glory of
their confession with an uncorrupt and unspotted mode of
life. And lest it should have been too little to have corrupted
<pb n='216'/><anchor id='Pg216'/>

portion of our broken fraternity against God's priesthood,
they have now applied themselves with their envenomed
deceitfulness to the ruin of the lapsed, to turn away from
the healing of their wound the sick and the wounded, and
those who, by the misfortune of their fall, are less fit and less
able to take stronger counsels; and having left off prayers and
supplications, whereby with long and continued satisfaction
the Lord is to be appeased, they invite them by the deceit of
a fallacious peace to a fatal rashness.

<p>
Ch. 3. But I pray you, brethren, watch against the snares
of the devil, and being careful for your own salvation, guard
diligently against this deadly deceit. This is another persecution

none other than the five leaders who were lately associated
with the magistrates in an edict that they might overthrow
our faith, that they might turn away the feeble hearts of the
brethren to their deadly nets by the perversion of the truth.
Now the same scheme, the same overturning, is again brought
about by the five presbyters, linked with Felicissimus, to the
destruction of salvation, that God should not be besought,
and that he who has denied Christ should not appeal for
mercy to the same Christ whom he has denied; that after
the fault of the crime repentance also should be taken away;
and that satisfaction should not be made through bishops
and priests, but, the Lord's priests being forsaken, a new
tradition of sacrilegious appointment should arise contrary
to the evangelical discipline. And although it was once arranged

named after the founder, Novatus or Novatianus, lasted for more

and a great many more presbyters and deacons; and likewise
the pastors of the remaining provinces deliberated in their

those who joined with him, and those who adopted his
brother-hating and inhuman opinion, should be considered
by the Church as strangers; but that they should heal such
of the brethren as had fallen into misfortune, and should minister
to them with the medicines of repentance. There have
come down to us epistles of Cornelius, bishop of Rome, to

<head>Chapter IV. The Period Of Peace For The Church: A. D. 260 To A. D. 303</head>

<p>
After the Decian-Valerian persecution (250-260) the Church
enjoyed a long peace, rarely interrupted anywhere by hostile
measures, until the outbreak of the second great general persecution,
under Diocletian (303-313), a space of over forty
years. In this period the Church cast off the chiliasm
which had lingered as a part of a primitive Jewish conception
of Christianity (<ref target="Section_47">§ 47</ref>), and adapted itself to the actual
condition of this present world. Under the influence of
scientific theology, especially that of the Alexandrian school,
the earlier forms of Monarchianism disappeared from the
Church, and the discussion began to narrow down to the
position which it eventually assumed in the Arian controversy
(<ref target="Section_48">§ 48</ref>). Corresponding to the development of the
theology went that of the cultus of the Church, and already
in the West abiding characteristics appeared (<ref target="Section_49">§ 49</ref>).
The cultus and the disciplinary work of the bishops advanced in
turn the hierarchical organization of the Church and the place
of the bishops (<ref target="Section_50">§ 50</ref>), but the theory of
local episcopal autonomy and the universalistic tendencies of the see of Rome
soon came into sharp conflict (<ref target="Section_51">§ 51</ref>), especially over the
validity of baptism administered by heretics (<ref target="Section_52">§ 52</ref>). In
this discussion the North African Church assumed a position
which subsequently became the occasion of the most serious
schism of the ancient Church, or Donatism. In this period,
also, is to be set the rise of Christian Monasticism as distinguished
from ordinary Christian asceticism (<ref target="Section_53">§ 53</ref>). At the
same time, a dangerous rival of Christianity appeared in
the East, in the form of Manichæanism, in which were absorbed
nearly all the remnants of earlier Gnosticism (<ref target="Section_54">§ 54</ref>).

<head>§ 47. The Chiliastic Controversy</head>

<p>
During the third century the belief in chiliasm as a part
of the Church's faith died out in nearly all parts of the
Church. It did not seem called for by the condition of the
Church, which was rapidly adjusting itself to the world in
which it found itself. The scientific theology, especially that
of Alexandria, found no place in its system for such an article
as chiliasm. The belief lingered, however, in country
places, and with it went no little opposition to the <q>scientific</q>
exegesis which by means of allegory explained away the promises
of a millennial kingdom. The only account we have of
this so-called <q>Chiliastic Controversy</q> is found in connection
with the history of the schism of Nepos in Egypt given by
Eusebius, But it may be safely assumed that the condition
of things here described was not peculiar to any one part of
the Church, though an open schism resulting from the conflict
of the old and new ideas is not found elsewhere.

Besides all these, the two books <hi rend='italic'>On the Promises</hi> were prepared
by him [Dionysius]. The occasion of these was Nepos,
a bishop in Egypt, who taught that the promises made to
the holy men in the divine Scriptures should be understood
in a more Jewish manner, and that there would be a certain
millennium of bodily luxury upon this earth. As he thought
that he could establish his private opinion by the Revelation
of John, he wrote a book on this subject, entitled <hi rend='italic'>Refutation

Promises</hi>. In the first he gives his own opinion of the dogma;
and in the second he treats of the Revelation of John,<note place="foot">In
the next chapter of Eusebius (= VII, 25) there are the critical reasons
against the apostolic authorship of the Revelation of St. John, based upon a
critical comparison with the Fourth Gospel and the Epistles of St. John, reasons

follows:
</p>

<p>
<q>But since they bring forward a certain work of Nepos, on
which they rely confidently, as if it proved beyond dispute
that there will be a reign of Christ upon earth, I confess
that in many other respects I approve and love Nepos for
his faith and industry and his diligence in the Scriptures,
and for his extensive psalmody with which many of the
brethren are still delighted; and I hold the man in the more
reverence because he has gone before us to rest.… But
as some think his work very plausible, and as certain teachers
regard the law and the prophets as of no consequence, and
do not follow the Gospels, and treat lightly the apostolic
epistles, while they make promises as to the teaching of this
work as if it were some great hidden mystery, and do not
permit our simpler brethren to have any sublime and lofty
thoughts concerning the glorious and truly divine appearing
of our Lord and our resurrection from the dead, and our being
gathered together unto Him, and made like Him, but, on the
contrary, lead them to a hope for small things and mortal
things in the kingdom of God, and for things such as exist
now—since this is the case, it is necessary that we should
<pb n='221'/><anchor id='Pg221'/>
dispute with our brother Nepos as if he were present.</q> Farther
on he says:
</p>

<p>
<q>When I was in the district of Arsinoe, where, as you know,
this doctrine has prevailed for a long time, so that schisms
and apostasies of entire churches have resulted, I called together
the presbyters and teachers of the brethren in the
villages—such brethren as wished being present—and I exhorted
them to make a public examination of this question.
Accordingly when they brought me this book, as if it were a
weapon and fortress impregnable, sitting with them from
morning till evening for three successive days, I endeavored
to correct what was written in it.… And finally the
author and mover of this teaching, who was called Coracion,
in the hearing of all the brethren present acknowledged and
testified to us that he would no longer hold this opinion, nor
discuss it, nor mention it, nor teach it, as he was fully convinced
by the arguments against it.</q>

<head>§ 48. Theology of the Second Half of the Third
Century under the Influence of Origen</head>

<p>
By the second half of the third century theology had become
a speculative and highly technical science
(<ref target="Section_48_a"><hi rend='italic'>a</hi></ref>), and under the
influence of Origen, the Logos theology, as opposed to various
forms of Monarchianism (<ref target="Section_48_b"><hi rend='italic'>b</hi></ref>),
had become universal. Under this influence, Paul of Samosata, reviving Dynamistic
Monarchianism,
modified it by combining with it elements of the
Logos theology (<hi rend='italic'>c-e</hi>). At the same time there was in
various parts of the Church a continuation of the Asia Minor
theological tradition, such as had found expression in
Irenæus. A representative of this theology was Methodius
of Olympus (<ref target="Section_48_f"><hi rend='italic'>f</hi></ref>).

Gregory Thaumaturgus, or the Wonder-worker, was born about 213
in Neo-Cæsarea in Pontus. He studied under Origen at Cæsarea in
Palestine from 233 to 235, and became one of the leading representatives
of the Origenistic theology, representing the orthodox development
of that school, as distinguished from Paul of Samosata and Lucian.

There is, therefore, nothing created or subservient in the

afterward; for there never was a time when the Son was
lacking to the Father, nor the Spirit to the Son, but the same
Trinity is ever unvarying and unchangeable.

<quote rend="display">
What has been called the <q>Controversy of the two Dionysii</q> was
in reality no controversy. Dionysius of Alexandria [<hi rend='italic'>v. supra</hi>,
<ref target="Section_48">§ 48</ref>]
wrote a letter to the Sabellians near Cyrene, pointing out the distinction
of the Father and the Son. In it he used language which was, to
say the least, indiscreet. Complaint was made to Dionysius, bishop
of Rome, that the bishop of Alexandria did not hold the right view
of the relation of the Son to the Father and of the divinity of the Son.
Thereupon, Dionysius of Rome wrote to Dionysius of Alexandria.
In reply, Dionysius of Alexandria pointed out at length, in a
<hi rend='italic'>Refutation and Defence</hi>, his actual opinion on the matter as a
whole, rather than as merely opposed to Modalistic Monarchianism or Sabellianism.
The course of the discussion is sufficiently clear from the extracts.
Athanasius is writing in answer to the Arians, who had appealed
to the letter of Dionysius in support of their opinion that the Son
was a creature, and that there was when He was not [<hi rend='italic'>v. infra</hi>,
<ref target="Section_63">§ 63</ref>].
His work, from which the following extracts are taken, was written
between 350 and 354.
</quote>

<p>
Ch. 4. They (the Arians) say, then, that in a letter the
blessed Dionysius has said: <q>The Son of God is a creature
and made, and not His own by nature, but in essence alien
from the Father, just as the husbandman is from the vine, or
the shipbuilder is from the boat; for that, being a creature,
He was not before He came to be.</q> Yes. He wrote it, and
we, too, admit that such was his letter. But as he wrote this,
so also he wrote very many other epistles, which ought to
be read by them, so that from all and not from one merely
the faith of the man might be discovered.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 5. At that time [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, when Dionysius wrote against
the Sabellians] certain of the bishops of Pentapolis in Upper
Libya were of the opinion of Sabellius. And they were so
successful with their opinion that the Son of God was scarcely
preached any longer in the churches. Dionysius heard of
this, as he had charge of those churches (<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Canon 6, Nicæa,
325; see below, <ref target="Section_72">§ 72</ref>), and sent men to counsel the guilty
ones to cease from their false doctrine. As they did not cease but
waxed more shameless in their impiety, he was compelled to
meet their shameless conduct by writing the said letter and
<pb n='224'/><anchor id='Pg224'/>
to define from the Gospels the human nature of the Saviour,
in order that, since those men waxed bolder in denying the
Son and in ascribing His human actions to the Father, he
accordingly, by demonstrating that it was not the Father
but the Son that was made man for us, might persuade the
ignorant persons that the Father is not the Son, and so by
degrees lead them to the true godhead of the Son and the
knowledge of the Father.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 6. … If in his writings he is inconsistent, let them
[<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the Arians] not draw him
to their side, for on this assumption
he is not worthy of credit. But if, when he had written
his letter to Ammonius, and fallen under suspicion, he made
his defence, bettering what he had said previously, defending
himself, but not changing, it must be evident that he wrote
what fell under suspicion by way of <q>accommodation.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ch. 13. The following is the occasion of his writing the
other letters. When Bishop Dionysius had heard of the
affairs in Pentapolis and had written in zeal for religion, as
I have said, his letter to Euphranor and Ammonius against
the heresy of Sabellius, some of the brethren belonging to
the Church, who held a right opinion, but did not ask him so
as to learn from himself what he had written, went up to
Rome and spake against him in the presence of his namesake,
Dionysius, bishop of Rome. And the latter, upon hearing
it, wrote simultaneously against the adherents of Sabellius
and against those who held the same opinions for uttering
which Arius was cast out of the Church; and he called it an
equal and opposite impiety to hold with Sabellius or with
those who say that the Word of God is a creature, framed
and originated. And he wrote also to Dionysius [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, of
Alexandria] to inform him of what they had said about him.
And the latter straightway wrote back and inscribed a book
entitled <hi rend='italic'>A Refutation and a Defence</hi>.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 14. … In answer to these charges he writes, after
certain prefatory matter in the first book of the work entitled
<hi rend='italic'>A Refutation and a Defence</hi>, in the following terms:
</p>

<pb n='225'/><anchor id='Pg225'/>

<p>
Ch. 15. <q>For never was there a time when God was not a
Father.</q> And this he acknowledges in what follows, <q>that
Christ is forever, being Word and Wisdom and Power. For
it is not to be supposed that God, having at first no issue,
afterward begat a Son. But the Son has his being not of
Himself, but of the Father.</q>

The deposition of Paul of Samosata.
</quote>

<quote rend="display">
The controversy concerning Paul's doctrinal views is sufficiently
set forth in the extract from Eusebius given below. Paul was bishop
of Antioch from about 260 to 268. His works have perished, with
the exception of a few fragments. The importance of Paul is that in
his teaching is to be found an attempt to combine the Logos theology
of Origen with Dynamistic Monarchianism, with results that appeared
later in Arianism, on the one hand, and Nestorianism, it is thought,
on the other.
</quote>

<p>
Ch. 27. After Sixtus had presided over the church of
Rome eleven years, Dionysius, namesake of him of Alexandria,
succeeded him. About that time Demetrianus died in
Antioch, and Paul of Samosata received that episcopate.
As he held low and degraded views of Christ, contrary to the
teaching of the Church, namely, that in his nature He was
a common man, Dionysius of Alexandria was entreated to
come to the synod. But being unable to come on account of
age and physical weakness, he gave his opinion on the subject
under consideration by a letter. But the other pastors of the
churches assembled from all directions, as against a despoiler
of the flock of Christ, all making haste to reach Antioch.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 29. During his [Aurelian's, 270-275] reign a final synod
composed of a great many bishops was held, and the leader
of heresy in Antioch was detected and his false doctrine
clearly shown before all, and he was excommunicated from
the Catholic Church under heaven. Malchion especially
drew him out from his hiding-place and refuted him. He was
a man learned also in other matters, and principal of the
sophist school of Grecian learning in Antioch; yet on account
of the superior nobility of his faith in Christ he had been made
<pb n='226'/><anchor id='Pg226'/>
a presbyter of that parish [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, diocese]. This man, having
conducted a discussion with him, which was taken down
by stenographers, and which we know is still extant, was
alone able to detect the man who dissembled and deceived
others.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 30. The pastors who had assembled about this matter
prepared by common consent an epistle addressed to Dionysius,
bishop of Rome, and Maximus of Alexandria, and sent
it to all the provinces.…
</p>

<p>
After other things they describe as follows the manner of
life which he led: <q>Whereas he has departed from the rule
[<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, of faith], and has turned aside after base and spurious
teachings, it is not necessary—since he is without—that we
should pass judgment upon his practices: as for instance …
in that he is haughty and is puffed up, and assumes
worldly dignities, preferring to be called ducenarius rather
than bishop; and struts in the market-places, reading letters
and reciting them as he walks in public, attended by a bodyguard,
with a multitude preceding and following him, so that
the faith is envied and hated on account of his pride and
haughtiness of heart, … or that he violently and coarsely
assails in public the expounders of the Word that have
departed this life, and magnifies himself, not as bishop, but
as a sophist and juggler, and stops the psalms to our Lord
Jesus Christ as being novelties and the productions of modern
men, and trains women to sing psalms to himself in the
midst of the church on the great day of the passover.…
He is unwilling to acknowledge that the Son of God came
down from heaven. (And this is no mere assertion, but is
abundantly proved from the records which we have sent you;
and not least where he says, <q>Jesus Christ is from below.</q>)…
And there are the women, the <q><hi rend='italic'>subintroductæ</hi>,</q> as the
people of Antioch call them, belonging to him and to the
presbyters and deacons with him. Although he knows and
has convicted these men, yet he connives at this and their
incurable sins, in order that they may be bound to him, and
<pb n='227'/><anchor id='Pg227'/>
through fear for themselves may not dare to accuse him for
his wicked words and deeds.…</q>
</p>

<p>
As Paul had fallen from the episcopate, as well as from the
orthodox faith, Domnus, as has been said, succeeded to the
service of the church at Antioch [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, became bishop]. But
as Paul refused to surrender the church building, the Emperor
Aurelian was petitioned; and he decided the matter most
equitably, ordering the building to be given to those to whom
the bishops of Italy and of the city of Rome should adjudge
it. Thus this man was driven out of the Church, with extreme
disgrace, by the worldly power.
</p>

<p>
Such was Aurelian's attitude toward us at that time; but
in the course of time he changed his mind in regard to us, and
was moved by certain advisers to institute a persecution
against us. And there was great talk about it everywhere.
But as he was about to do it, and was, so to speak, in the
very act of signing the decrees against us, the divine judgment
came upon him and restrained him at the very verge
of his undertaking.

first-formed man, and first and first-born of men, and should
become incarnate. And this was Christ, a man filled with
the pure and perfect Godhead, and God received into man.
For it was most suitable that the oldest of the Æons and the
first of the archangels, when about to hold communion with
men, should dwell in the oldest and first of men, even Adam.
And thus, renovating those things which were from the
beginning, and forming them again of the Virgin by the Spirit,
He frames the same just as at the beginning.

Ch. 8. The Church could not conceive believers and give
them new birth by the laver of regeneration unless Christ,
emptying Himself for their sakes, that He might be contained
by them, as I said, through the recapitulation of His passion,
should die again, coming down from heaven, and, being <q>joined
to His wife,</q> the Church, should provide that a certain
power be taken from His side, so that all who are built up in
Him should grow up, even those who are born again by the
laver, receiving of His bones and of His flesh; that is, of His
holiness and of His glory. For he who says that the bones
and flesh of Wisdom are understanding and virtue, says most
rightly; and that the side [rib] is the Spirit of truth, the
Paraclete, of whom the illuminated [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, baptized], receiving,
are fitly born again to incorruption.

If any one were to think that the earthly
image is the flesh itself, but the heavenly image is some other

Christ, the heavenly man, when He appeared, bore the same
form of limbs and the same image of flesh as ours, through
<pb n='231'/><anchor id='Pg231'/>
which, also, He, who was not man, became man, that, <q>as in

if it was not that he might set the flesh free and raise it up
that He bore flesh, why did He bear flesh superfluously, as
He purposed neither to save it nor to raise it up? But the
Son of God does nothing superfluous. He did not take, then,
the form of a servant uselessly, but to raise it up and save it.
For He was truly made man, and died, and not in appearance,
but that He might truly be shown to be the first begotten
from the dead, changing the earthly into the heavenly, and
the mortal into the immortal.

<head>§ 49. The Development of the Cultus</head>

<p>
The Church's cultus and sacramental system developed
rapidly in the third century. The beginnings of the administration
of the sacraments according to prescribed forms are
to be traced to the Didache and Justin Martyr (see above,
§§ <ref target="Section_13">13</ref>, <ref target="Section_14">14</ref>).
At the beginning of the third century baptism
was already accompanied by a series of subsidiary rites, and
the eucharist was regarded as a sacrifice, the benefit of which
might be directed toward specific ends. The further development
was chiefly in connection with the eucharist, which effected
in turn the conception of the hierarchy (see below,
<ref target="Section_50">§ 50</ref>). Baptism was regarded
as conferring complete remission of previous sins;
subsequent sins were atoned for in the penitential discipline
(see above, <ref target="Section_42">§ 42</ref>). As for the eucharist, the
conception of the sacrifice which appears in the Didache, an
offering of praise and thanksgiving, gradually gives place to
a sacrifice which in some way partakes of the nature of
Christ's sacrificial death upon the cross. At the same time,
the elements are more and more completely identified with the
body and blood of Christ, and the nature of the presence of
Christ is conceived under quasi-physical categories. As representatives
of the lines of development, Tertullian, at the
beginning of the century, and Cyprian, at the middle, may
<pb n='232'/><anchor id='Pg232'/>
be taken. That a similar development took place in the East
is evident, not only from the references to the same in the
writings of Origen and others, but also from the appearance in
the next century of elaborate services, or liturgies, as well as
the doctrinal statements of writers generally.

The ceremonies connected with baptism.

<p>
And how long shall we draw the saw to and fro through
this line when we have an ancient practice which by anticipation
has settled the state of the question? If no passage of
Scripture has prescribed it, assuredly custom, which without
doubt flowed from tradition, has confirmed it. For how can
anything come into use if it has not first been handed down?
Even in pleading tradition written authority, you say, must
be demanded. Let us inquire, therefore, whether tradition,
unless it be written, should not be admitted. Certainly we
shall say that it ought not to be admitted if no cases of
other practices which, without any written instrument, we
maintain on the ground of tradition alone, and the countenance
thereafter of custom, affords us any precedent. To
deal with this matter briefly, I shall begin with baptism.
When we are going to enter the water, but a little before,
in the church and under the hand of the president, we solemnly
profess that we renounce the devil, and his pomp, and
his angels. Hereupon we are thrice immersed, making a
somewhat ampler pledge than the Lord has appointed in
the Gospel. Then, when we are taken up (as new-born children),
we taste first of all a mixture of milk and honey; and
from that day we refrain from the daily bath for a whole
week. We take also in congregations, before daybreak, and
from the hands of none but the presidents, the sacrament of
the eucharist, which the Lord both commanded to be eaten
at meal-times, and by all. On the anniversary day we make
offerings for the dead as birthday honors. We consider fasting
on the Lord's Day to be unlawful, as also to worship
<pb n='233'/><anchor id='Pg233'/>
kneeling. We rejoice in the same privilege from Easter to
Pentecost. We feel pained should any wine or bread, even
though our own, be cast upon the ground. At every forward
step and movement, at every going in and going out, when
we put on our shoes, at the bath, at table, on lighting the
lamps, on couch, on seat, in all the ordinary actions of daily
life, we trace upon the forehead the sign [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, of the cross].

Thascius Cæcilius Cyprianus, bishop of Carthage, was born about
200, and became bishop in 248 or 249. His doctrinal position is a
development of that of Tertullian, beside whom he may be placed
as one of the founders of the characteristic theology of North Africa.
His discussion of the place and authority of the bishop in the ecclesiastical
system was of fundamental importance in the development of
the theory of the hierarchy, though it may be questioned whether
his particular theory of the relation of the bishops to each other ever
was realized in the Church. For his course during the Decian persecution

In the epistle from which the following extract is taken Cyprian
writes to Cæcilius to point out that it is wrong to use merely water in
the eucharist, and that wine mixed with water should be used, for in
all respects we do exactly what Christ did at the Last Supper when he
instituted the eucharist. In the course of the letter, which is of some
length, Cyprian takes occasion to set forth his conception of the
eucharistic sacrifice, which is a distinct advance upon Tertullian.

Ch. 13. Because Christ bore us all, in that He also bore
our sins, we see that in the water is understood the people,
but in the wine is showed the blood of Christ. But when
in the cup the water is mingled with the wine the people is
made one with Christ, and the assembly of believers is associated
and conjoined with Him on whom it believes; which
association and conjunction of water and wine is so mingled
in the Lord's cup that that mixture cannot be separated
any more. Whence, moreover, nothing can separate the
Church—that is, the people established in the Church,
faithfully and firmly continuing in that in which they have
believed—from Christ in such a way as to prevent their
undivided love from always abiding and adhering. Thus,
<pb n='235'/><anchor id='Pg235'/>
therefore, in consecrating the cup water alone should not
be offered to the Lord, even as wine alone should not be
offered. For if wine only is offered, the blood of Christ
begins to be without us.<note place="foot"><foreign lang="la"
rend="font-style: italic">Sanguis Christi incipit esse sine nobis.</foreign>
Paschasius Radbertus quotes this. <hi rend='italic'>De corpore et
sanguine Domini</hi>, ch. II, MSL, 120:1308.</note>
But if the water alone be offered,
the people begin to be without Christ, but when both are
mingled and are joined to each other by an intermixed union,
then the spiritual and heavenly sacrament is completed.
Thus the cup of the Lord is not, indeed, water alone, nor
wine alone, nor unless each be mingled with the other; just
as, on the other hand, the body of the Lord cannot be flour
alone or water alone, nor unless both should be united and
joined together and compacted into the mass of one bread:
in which sacrament our people are shown to be one; so that
in like manner as many grains are collected and ground
and mixed together into one mass and made one bread,
so in Christ, who is the heavenly bread, we may know that
there is one body with which our number is joined and
united.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 14. There is, then, no reason, dearest brother, for any
one to think that the custom of certain persons is to be followed,
who in times past have thought that water alone
should be offered in the cup of the Lord. For we must inquire
whom they themselves have followed. For if in the sacrifice
which Christ offered none is to be followed but Christ, we
ought certainly to obey and do what Christ did, and what He
commanded to be done, since He himself says in the Gospel:
<q>If ye do whatsoever I command you, henceforth I call you
not servants, but friends</q> [John 15:14 <hi rend='italic'>f.</hi>].… If Jesus
Christ, our Lord and God, is Himself the chief priest of God
the Father, and has first offered Himself a sacrifice to the
Father, and has commanded this to be done in commemoration
of Himself, certainly that priest truly acts in the place of
Christ who imitates what Christ did; and he then offers a
true and full sacrifice in the Church of God to God the Father
<pb n='236'/><anchor id='Pg236'/>
when he proceeds to offer it according to what he sees Christ
himself to have offered.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 15. But the discipline of all religion and truth is overturned
unless what is spiritually prescribed be faithfully
observed; unless, indeed, any one should fear in the morning
sacrifices lest the taste of wine should be redolent of the blood
of Christ.<note place="foot">Reference to the possibility of detecting
Christians in times of persecution by the odor of wine which they had
received in the eucharist early in the morning.</note>
Therefore, thus the brotherhood is beginning to
be kept back from the passion of Christ in persecutions by
learning in the offerings to be disturbed concerning His blood
and His blood-shedding.… But how can we shed our blood
for Christ who blush to drink the blood of Christ?
</p>

<p>
Ch. 16. Does any one perchance flatter himself with this
reflection—that, although in the morning water alone is seen
to be offered, yet when we come to supper we offer the mingled
cup? But when we sup, we cannot call the people together
for our banquet that we may celebrate the truth of
the sacrament in the presence of the entire brotherhood.
But still it was not in the morning, but after supper that the
Lord offered the mingled cup. Ought we, then, to celebrate
the Lord's cup after supper, that so by continual repetition
of the Lord's Supper we may offer the mingled cup? It was
necessary that Christ should offer about the evening of the
day, that the very hour of sacrifice might show the setting
and the evening of the world as it is written in Exodus:
<q>And all the people of the synagogue of the children of
Israel shall kill it in the evening.</q><note place="foot">Ex. 12:6.</note>
And again in the Psalms: <q>Let the lifting up of my hands be
an evening sacrifice.</q><note place="foot">Psalm. 141:2.</note>
But we celebrate the resurrection of the Lord in the morning.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 17. And because we make mention of His passion in
all sacrifices (for the Lord's passion is the sacrifice which we
offer), we ought to do nothing else than what He did. For
the Scripture says: <q>For as often as ye eat this bread and
<pb n='237'/><anchor id='Pg237'/>
drink this cup, ye do show forth the Lord's death till He
come.</q><note place="foot">I Cor. 11:26.</note>
As often, therefore, as we offer the cup in commemoration
of the Lord and His passion, let us do what it is
known the Lord did.

<head>§ 50. The Episcopate in the Church</head>

<p>
The greatest name connected with the development of the
hierarchical conception of the Church in the third century
is without question Cyprian (see <ref target="Section_49">§ 49</ref>). He developed the
conception of the episcopate beyond the point it had reached
in the hands of Tertullian, to whom the institution was
important primarily as a guardian of the deposit of faith and
a pledge of the continuity of the Church. In the hands of
Cyprian the episcopate became the essential foundation of
the Church. According to his theory of the office, every
bishop was the peer of every other bishop and had the same
duties to his diocese and to the Church as a whole as every
other bishop. No bishop had any more than a moral authority
over any other. Only the whole body of bishops, or
the council, could bring anything more than moral authority
to bear upon an offending prelate. The constitution of the
council was not as yet defined. In several points the ecclesiastical
theories of Cyprian were not followed by the Church
as a whole, notably his opinion regarding heretical baptism
(see <ref target="Section_47">§ 47</ref>), but his main contention as to
the importance of the episcopate for the very existence (<foreign
lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">esse</foreign>), and not the mere
welfare (<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">bene esse</foreign>), of
the Church was universally accepted.
His theory of the equality of all bishops was a survival of
an earlier period, and represented little more than his personal
ideal. The following sections should also be consulted
in this connection.

Although a rebellious and arrogant multitude of those who
will not obey depart, yet the Church does not depart from
Christ; and they are the Church who are a people united to
the priest, and the flock which adheres to its pastor. Whence
you ought to know that the bishop is in the Church and the
Church in the bishop; and that if any one be not with the
bishop, he is not in the Church, and that those flatter themselves
in vain who creep in, not having peace with God's
priests, and think that they communicate secretly with some;
while the Church, which is Catholic and one, is not cut nor
divided, but is indeed connected and bound together by the
cement of the priests who cohere with one another.

compel his colleagues to the necessity of obedience; since
every bishop, according to the allowance of his liberty and
power, has his own proper right of judgment, and can no
more be judged by another than he himself can judge another.

had lapsed in the persecution and had been deprived of their sees.
The passage illustrates the methods of election and ordination of
bishops, and the failure of Cyprian, with his theory of the episcopate,
to recognize in the see of Rome any jurisdiction over other bishops.
Its date appears to be about 257.

<p>
You must diligently observe and keep the practice delivered
from divine tradition and apostolic observance, which is
also maintained among us, and throughout almost all the
provinces: that for the proper celebration of ordinations all
the neighboring bishops of the same province should assemble
with that people for which a prelate is ordained. And the
bishops should be chosen in the presence of the people, who
have most fully known the life of each one, and have looked
into the doings of each one as respects his manner of life.
And this also, we see, was done by you in the ordination of our
colleague Sabinus; so that, by the suffrage of the whole brotherhood,
and by the sentence of the bishops who had assembled
in their presence, and who had written letters to you concerning
him, the episcopate was conferred upon him, and
hands were imposed on him in the place of Basilides. Neither
can an ordination properly completed be annulled, so that
Basilides, after his crimes had been discovered and his conscience
made bare, even by his own confession, might go to
Rome and deceive Stephen, our colleague, who was placed
at a distance and was ignorant of what had been done, so as
to bring it about that he might be replaced unjustly in the
episcopate from which he had been justly deposed.

<head>§ 51. The Unity of the Church and the See of Rome</head>

<p>
In the middle of the third century there were in sharp conflict
two distinct and opposed theories of Church unity:
the theory that the unity was based upon adherence to and
conformity with the see of Peter; and the theory that the
episcopate was itself one, and that each bishop shared equally
in it. The unity was either in one see or in the less tangible
unity of an order of the hierarchy. The former was the
theory of the Roman bishops; the latter, the theory of Cyprian
of Carthage, and possibly of a number of other ecclesiastics
in North Africa and Asia Minor. Formerly polemical theology
made the study of this point difficult, at least with
anything like impartiality. In the passage given below from
Cyprian's treatise <hi rend='italic'>On the Unity of the Catholic Church</hi> the
text of the Jesuit Father Kirch is followed in the most difficult
and interpolated chapter 4. As Father Kirch gives the text
it is perfectly consistent with the theory of Cyprian as he has
elsewhere stated it, and that the interpolated text is not.

made in the text which seriously distort the sense. These interpolations

Upon one he builds the Church, although also to all the
Apostles after His resurrection He gives an equal power and
says, <q>As the Father has sent me, I also send you: receive
ye the Holy Ghost: whosesoever sins ye retain, they shall
be retained</q> (John 20:21); yet, that He might show the
unity, [He founded one see. <hi rend='italic'>Interpolation.</hi>] He arranged by
His authority the origin of that unity as beginning from one.
Assuredly the rest of the Apostles were also what Peter was,
with a like partnership both of honor and power; but the
beginning proceeds from unity [and the primacy is given to
Peter. <hi rend='italic'>Interpolation.</hi>], that there might be shown to be one
Church of Christ [and one see. And they are all shepherds,

trust that he is in the Church, when, moreover, the

Ch. 5. And this unity we ought to hold firmly and assert,
especially we bishops who preside in the Church, that we may
prove the episcopate itself to be one and undivided. Let
no one deceive the brotherhood by a falsehood; let no one
corrupt the truth by a perfidious prevarication. The episcopate
is one, each part of which is held by each one in its
entirety. The Church, also, is one which is spread abroad
far and wide into a multitude by an increase of fruitfulness.
As there are many rays of the sun, but one light, and many
branches of a tree, but one strength based upon its tenacious
root, and since from one spring flow many streams, although
the multiplicity seems diffused in the liberality of an overflowing
abundance, yet the unity is still preserved in its source.

<quote rend="display">
The matter in dispute was the rebaptism of those heretics who
had received baptism before they conformed to the Church. See
<ref target="Section_52">§ 52</ref>.
It was the burning question after the rise of the Novatian sect. Stephen,
bishop of Rome (254-257), had excommunicated a number of
churches and bishops, among them probably Cyprian himself. See
the epistle of Dionysius to Sixtus of Rome, the successor of Stephen,
in Eusebius, <hi rend='italic'>Hist. Ec.</hi>, VII, 5. <q>He</q> (Stephen) therefore had
written previously concerning Helenus and Firmilianus and all those
in Cilicia, Cappadocia, Galatia, and the neighboring countries, saying
that he would not communicate with them for this same cause:
namely, that they rebaptized heretics. This attitude of Stephen
roused no little resentment in the East, as is shown by the indignant
tone of Firmilian, who recognizes no authority in Rome. The text
may be found in Mirbt, n. 74, and in part in Kirch, n. 274. The
epistle of Firmilian is to be found among the epistles of Cyprian, to
whom it was written.

<p>
Ch. 2. We may in this matter give thanks to Stephen that
it has now happened through his unkindness [inhumanity]
that we receive proof of your faith and wisdom.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 3. But let these things which were done by Stephen be
passed by for the present, lest, while we remember his audacity
and pride, we bring a more lasting sadness on ourselves
from the things he has wickedly done.
</p>

<pb n='243'/><anchor id='Pg243'/>

<p>
Ch. 6. That they who are at Rome do not observe those
things in all cases which have been handed down from the
beginning, and vainly pretend the authority of the Apostles,
any one may know; also, from the fact that concerning the
celebration of the day of Easter, and concerning many other
sacraments of divine matters, one may see that there are some
diversities among them, and that all things are not observed
there alike which are observed at Jerusalem; just as in very
many other provinces also many things are varied because
of the difference of places and names, yet on this account
there is no departure at all from the peace and unity of the
Catholic Church. And this departure Stephen has now
dared to make; breaking the peace against you, which his
predecessors have always kept with you in mutual love and
honor, even herein defaming Peter and Paul, the blessed
Apostles, as if the very men delivered this who in their epistles
execrated heretics and warned us to avoid them. Whence
it appears that this tradition is human which maintains heretics,
and asserts that they have baptism, which belongs to
the Church alone.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 17. And in this respect I am justly indignant at this so
open and manifest folly of Stephen, that he who so boasts of
the place of his episcopate and contends that he holds the
succession of Peter, on whom the foundation of the Church
was laid, should introduce many other rocks and establish
new buildings of many churches, maintaining that there is a
baptism in them by his authority; for those who are baptized,
without doubt, make up the number of the Church.…
Stephen, who announces that he holds by succession the
throne of Peter, is stirred with no zeal against heretics, when
he concedes to them, not a moderate, but the very greatest
power of grace.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 19. This, indeed, you Africans are able to say against
Stephen, that when you knew the truth you forsook the
error of custom. But we join custom to truth, and to the
Romans' custom we oppose custom, but the custom of
<pb n='244'/><anchor id='Pg244'/>
truth, holding from the beginning that which was delivered
by Christ and the Apostles. Nor do we remember that this
at any time began among us, since it has always been observed
here, that we have known none but one Church of God, and
have accounted no baptism holy except that of the holy
Church.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 24. Consider with what want of judgment you dare to
blame those who strive for the truth against falsehood.<note place="foot">This
whole passage is supposed to be addressed to Stephen. <hi rend='italic'>Cf.</hi>
the opening words of <ref target="Section_25">§ 25</ref>.</note> …
For how many strifes and dissensions have you stirred up
throughout the churches of the whole world! Moreover, how
great sin have you heaped up for yourself, when you cut yourself
off from so many flocks! For it is yourself that you have
cut off. Do not deceive yourself, since he is really the schismatic
who has made himself an apostate from the communion
of ecclesiastical unity. For while you think that all may
be excommunicated by you, you have alone excommunicated
yourself from all; and not even the precepts of an Apostle
have been able to mould you to the rule of truth and peace.<note place="foot">Eph.
4:1-6 follows.</note>
</p>

<p>
Ch. 25. How carefully has Stephen fulfilled these salutary
commands and warnings of the Apostle, keeping in the first
place lowliness of mind and meekness! For what is more
lowly or meek than to have disagreed with so many bishops
throughout the whole world, breaking peace with each one
of them in various kinds of discord: at one time with the
Easterns, as we are sure is not unknown to you; at another
time with you who are in the south, from whom he received
bishops as messengers sufficiently patiently and meekly as
not to receive them even to the speech of common conference;
and, even more, so unmindful of love and charity as to command
the whole brotherhood that no one should receive
them into his house, so that not only peace and communion,
but also a shelter and entertainment were denied to them
when they came. This is to have kept the unity of the Spirit
<pb n='245'/><anchor id='Pg245'/>
in the bond of peace, to cut himself off from the unity of love,
and to make himself a stranger in all things to his brethren,
and to rebel against the sacrament and the faith with the madness
of contumacious discord.… Stephen is not ashamed
to afford patronage to such a position in the Church, and for
the sake of maintaining heretics to divide the brotherhood;
and, in addition, to call Cyprian a false Christ, and a false
Apostle, and a deceitful worker, and he, conscious that all
these characters are for himself, has been in advance of you
by falsely objecting to another those things which he himself
ought to bear.

<head>§ 52. Controversy over Baptism by Heretics</head>

<p>
In the great persecutions schisms arose in connection with
the administration of discipline (<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi>
<ref target="Section_46">§ 46</ref>). The schismatics
held in general the same faith as the main body of Christians.
Were the sacraments they administered to be regarded, then,
as valid in such a sense that when they conformed to the
Catholic Church, which they frequently did, they need not
be baptized, having once been validly baptized; or should
their schismatic baptism be regarded as invalid and they be
required to receive baptism on conforming if they had not
previously been baptized within the Church? Was baptism
outside the unity of the Church valid? Rome answered in
the affirmative, admitting conforming schismatics without
distinguishing as to where they had been baptized; North
Africa answered in the negative and required not, indeed, a
second baptism, but claimed that the Church's baptism was
alone valid, and that if the person conforming had been baptized
in schism he had not been baptized at all. This view
was shared by at least some churches in Asia Minor (<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi>
<ref target="Section_51_b">§ 51, <hi rend='italic'>b</hi></ref>),
and possibly elsewhere. It became the basis of the Donatist position
(<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> <ref target="Section_62">§ 62</ref>),
which schism shared with the Novatian schism the opinion,
generally rejected by the Church, that the validity of a sacrament
depended upon the
<pb n='246'/><anchor id='Pg246'/>
spiritual condition of the minister of the sacrament, <hi rend='italic'>e.g.</hi>,
whether he was in schism or not.

<p>
Ch. 7. It is manifest where and by whom the remission of
sins can be given, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, that remission which is given by
baptism. For first of all the Lord gave the power to Peter,
upon whom He built the Church, and whence he appointed
and showed the source of unity, the power, namely, that
that should be loosed in heaven which he loosed on earth
[John 20:21 quoted]. When we perceive that only they who
are set over the Church and established in the Gospel law and
in the ordinance of the Lord are allowed to baptize and to
give remission of sins, we see that outside of the Church
nothing can be bound or loosed, for there there is no one
who can either bind or loose anything.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 21. Can the power of baptism be greater or of more
avail than confession, than suffering when one confesses Christ
before men, and is baptized in his own blood? And yet, even
this baptism does not benefit a heretic, although he has confessed
Christ and been put to death outside the Church,
unless the patrons and advocates of heretics [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, those whom
Cyprian is opposing] declare that the heretics who are slain
in a false confession of Christ are martyrs, and assign to them
the glory and the crown of martyrdom contrary to the testimony
of the Apostle, who says that it will profit them
nothing although they are burned and slain. But if not even
the baptism of a public confession and blood can profit a
heretic to salvation, because there is no salvation outside of
the Church, how much less shall it benefit him if, in a hiding-place
and a cave of robbers stained with the contagion of
<pb n='247'/><anchor id='Pg247'/>
adulterous waters, he has not only not put off his old sins,
but rather heaped up still newer and greater ones! Wherefore
baptism cannot be common to us and to heretics, to whom
neither God the Father nor Christ the Son, nor the Holy
Ghost, nor the faith, nor the Church itself is common. And
wherefore they ought to be baptized who come from heresy
to the Church, so that they who are prepared and receive the
lawful and true and only baptism of the holy Church, by
divine regeneration for the kingdom of God may be born of
both sacraments, because it is written: <q>Except a man be
born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom
of God</q> [John 3:5].
</p>

<p>
Ch. 26. These things, dearest brother, we have briefly
written to you according to our modest abilities, prescribing
to none and prejudging none, so as to prevent any one of the
bishops doing what he thinks well, and having the free exercise
of his judgment.

<p>
With your usual diligence you have consulted my poor
intelligence, dearest son, as to whether, among other heretics,
they also who come from Novatian ought, after his profane
washing, to be baptized and sanctified in the Catholic Church,
with the lawful, true, and only baptism of the Church. In
answer to this question, as much as the capacity of my faith
and the sanctity and truth of the divine Scriptures suggest,
I say that no heretics and schismatics at all have any right
to power. For which reason Novatian, since he is without
the Church and is acting in opposition to the peace and love
of Christ, neither ought to be, nor can be, omitted from being
counted among the adversaries and antichrists. For our
Lord Jesus Christ, when He declared in His Gospel that those
who were not with Him were His adversaries, did not point
out any species of heresy, but showed that all who were not
with Him, and who were not gathering with Him, were
<pb n='248'/><anchor id='Pg248'/>
scattering His flock, and were His adversaries, saying: <q>He
that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not
with me scattereth</q> [Luke 11:23]. Moreover, the blessed
Apostle John distinguished no heresy or schism, neither did
he set down any specially separated, but he called all who
had gone out from the Church, and who acted in opposition
to the Church, antichrists, saying, <q>Ye have heard that Antichrist
cometh, and even now are come many antichrists;
wherefore we know that this is the last time. They went
out from us, but they were not of us, for if they had been of
us, they would have continued with us</q> [I John 2:18 <hi rend='italic'>f.</hi>].
Whence it appears that all are adversaries of the Lord and are
antichrists who are known to have departed from the charity
and from the unity of the Catholic Church.

<head>§ 53. The Beginnings of Monasticism</head>

<p>
Asceticism in some form is common to almost all religions.
It was practised extensively in early Christianity and ascetics
of both sexes were numerous. This asceticism, in addition to
a life largely devoted to prayer and fasting, was marked by
refraining from marriage. But these ascetics lived in close
relations with those who were non-ascetics. Monasticism is
an advance upon this earlier asceticism in that it attempts to
create, apart from non-ascetics, a social order composed only
of ascetics in which the ascetic ideals may be more successfully
realized. The transition was made by the hermit life
in which the ascetic lived alone in deserts and other solitudes.
This became monasticism by the union of ascetics for mutual
spiritual aid. This advance is associated with St. Anthony.
See also Pachomius, in <ref target="Section_77">§ 77</ref>.

<quote rend="display">
Anthony, although not the first hermit, gave such an impetus to
the ascetic life and did so much to bring about some union of ascetics
that he has been popularly regarded as the founder of monasticism.
He died 356, at the age of one hundred and five. His <hi rend='italic'>Life</hi>, by St.
Athanasius, although formerly attacked, is a genuine, and, on the
whole, trustworthy account of this remarkable man. It was written
either 357 or 365, and was translated into Latin by Evagrius of
Antioch (died 393). Everywhere it roused the greatest enthusiasm for
monasticism. The <hi rend='italic'>Life of St. Paul of Thebes</hi>, by St. Jerome, is of
very different character, and of no historical value.
</quote>

<p>
Ch. 2. After the death of his parents, Anthony was left
alone with one little sister. He was about eighteen or twenty
years old, and on him rested the care of both the home and
his sister. Now it happened not six months after the death of
his parents, and when he was going, according to custom,
into the Lord's house, and was communing with himself, that
he reflected as he walked how the Apostles left all and followed
the Saviour, and how, in the Acts, men sold their possessions
and brought and laid them at the Apostles' feet for
distribution to the needy, and what and how great a hope
was laid up for them in heaven. While he was reflecting on
these things he entered the church, and it happened that at
that time the Gospel was being read, and he heard the Lord
say to the rich man: <q>If thou wouldest be perfect, go and sell
that thou hast and give to the poor; and come and follow
me and thou shalt have treasure in heaven.</q> Anthony, as
though God had put him in mind of the saints and the passage
had been read on his account, went out straightway from
the Lord's house, and gave the possessions which he had
from his forefathers to the villagers—they were three hundred
acres, productive and very fair—that they should be no more
a clog upon himself and his sister. And all the rest that
was movable he sold, and, having got together much money,
he gave it to the poor, reserving a little, however, for his sister's
sake.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 3. And again as he went into the Lord's house, and
hearing the Lord say in the Gospel, <q>Be not anxious for the
<pb n='250'/><anchor id='Pg250'/>
morrow,</q> he could stay no longer, but went and gave also
those things to the poor. He then committed his sister to
known and faithful virgins, putting her in a convent
[<foreign lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">parthenon</foreign>],
to be brought up, and henceforth he devoted himself
outside his house to ascetic discipline, taking heed to himself
and training himself patiently. For there were not yet many
monasteries in Egypt, and no monk at all knew of the distant
desert; but every one of those who wished to give heed to
themselves practised the ascetic discipline in solitude near
his own village. Now there was in the next village an old
man who had lived from his youth the life of a hermit.
Anthony, after he had seen this man, imitated him in piety.
And at first he began to abide in places outside the village.
Then, if he heard of any good man anywhere, like the prudent
bee, he went forth and sought him, nor did he turn back to
his own place until he had seen him; and he returned, having
got from the good man supplies, as it were, for his journey
in the way of virtue. So dwelling there at first, he steadfastly
held to his purpose not to return to the abode of his parents or
to the remembrance of his kinsfolk; but to keep all his desire
and energy for the perfecting of his discipline. He worked,
however, with his hands, having heard that <q>he who is idle,
let him not eat,</q> and part he spent on bread and part he gave
to the needy. And he prayed constantly, because he had
learned that a man ought to pray in secret unceasingly.
For he had given such heed to what was read that none of
those things that were written fell from him to the ground;
for he remembered all, and afterward his memory served him
for books.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 4. Thus conducting himself, Anthony was beloved by
all. He subjected himself in sincerity to the good men he
visited, and learned thoroughly wherein each surpassed him
in zeal and discipline. He observed the graciousness of one,
the unceasing prayer of another; he took knowledge of one's
freedom from anger, and another's kindliness; he gave heed
to one as he watched, to another as he studied; one he admired
<pb n='251'/><anchor id='Pg251'/>
for his endurance, another for his fasting and sleeping
on the ground; he watched the meekness of one, and the long-suffering
of another; and at the same time he noted the piety
toward Christ and the mutual love which animated all.
</p>

<quote rend="display">
Athanasius describes Anthony's removal to the desert and the
coming of disciples to him, and weaves into his narrative, in the form
of a speech, a long account of the discipline laid down, probably by
Anthony himself, chs. 16-43. It is to this long speech that the opening
words of the following section refers.
</quote>

<p>
Ch. 44. While Anthony was thus speaking all rejoiced;
in some the love of virtue increased, in others carelessness was
thrown aside, the self-conceit of others was stopped; and
all were persuaded to despise the assaults of the Evil One,
and marvelled at the grace given Anthony from the Lord for
the discerning of spirits. So their cells were in the mountains,
like tabernacles filled with holy bands of men who sang psalms,
loved reading, fasted, prayed, rejoiced in the hope of things
to come, labored in almsgiving, and maintained love and
harmony with one another. And truly it was possible to
behold a land, as it were, set by itself, filled with piety and
justice. For then there was neither the evil-doer nor the
injured, nor the reproaches of the tax-gatherer; but instead
a multitude of ascetics, and the one purpose of all was to
aim at virtue. So that one beholding the cells again and
seeing such good order among the monks would lift up his
voice and say: <q>How goodly are thy dwellings, O Jacob,
and thy tents, O Israel; as shady glens and as a garden by a
river; as tents which the Lord has pitched, and like cedars
near the waters</q> [Num. 24:5, 6].
</p>

<p>
Ch. 45. Anthony, however, returned, according to his custom,
alone to his cell, increased his discipline, and sighed
daily as he thought of the mansions of heaven, having his
desire fixed on them and pondering over the shortness of
man's life.

<head>§ 54. Manichæanism</head>

<p>
The last great rival religion to Christianity was Manichæanism,
the last of the important syncretistic religions which
drew from Persian and allied sources. Its connection with
Christianity was at first slight and its affinities were with
Eastern Gnosticism. After 280 it began to spread within
the Empire, and was soon opposed by the Roman authorities.
Yet it flourished, and, like other Gnostic religions, with which
it is to be classed, it assimilated more and more of Christianity,
until in the time of Augustine it seemed to many as merely a
form of Christianity. On account of its general character, it
absorbed for the most part what remained of the earlier
Gnostic systems and schools.

<div>
<head>(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) The Life of Mani.</head>

<p>
Mohammed ibn Isak says: Mani was the son of Fatak,<note place="foot">Or. Fonnak.</note>
of the family of the Chaskanier. Ecbatana is said to have been
the original home of his father, from which he emigrated to the
province of Babylon. He took up his residence in Al Madain,
in a portion of the city known as Ctesiphon. In that place
was an idol's temple, and Fatak was accustomed to go into
it, as did also the other people of the place. It happened one
<pb n='253'/><anchor id='Pg253'/>
day that a voice sounded forth from the sacred interior of
the temple, saying to him: <q>Fatak, eat no flesh, drink no
wine and refrain from carnal intercourse.</q> This was repeated
to him several times on three days. When Fatak perceived
this, he joined a society of people in the neighborhood of
Dastumaisan which were known under the name of Al-Mogtasilah,
<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, those who wash themselves, baptists, and
of whom remnants are to be found in these parts and in the
marshy districts at the present time. These belonged to that
mode of life which Fatak had been commanded to follow.
His wife was at that time pregnant with Mani, and when she
had given him birth she had, as they say, glorious visions
regarding him, and even when she was awake she saw him
taken by some one unseen, who bore him aloft into the air,
and then brought him down again; sometimes he remained
even a day or two before he came down again. Thereupon his
father sent for him and had him brought to the place where
he was, and so he was brought up with him in his religion.
Mani, in spite of his youthful age, spake words of wisdom.
After he had completed his twelfth year there came to him,
according to his statement, a revelation from the King of the
Paradise of Light, who is God the Exalted, as he said. The
angel which brought him the revelation was called Eltawan;
this name means <q>the Companion.</q> He spoke to Mani, and
said: <q>Separate thyself from this sort of faith, for thou belongest
not among its adherents, and it is obligatory upon you to
practise continence and to forsake the fleshly desires, yet on
account of thy youth the time has not come for thee to take
up thy public work.</q> But when he was twenty-four years
old, Eltawan appeared to him and said: <q>Hail, Mani, from
me and from the Lord who has sent me to thee and has
chosen thee to be his prophet. He commands thee now to
proclaim thy truth and on my announcement to proclaim the
truth which is from him and to throw thyself into this calling
with all thy zeal.</q>
</p>

<p>
The Manichæans say: He first openly entered upon his
<pb n='254'/><anchor id='Pg254'/>
work on the day when Sapor, the son of Ardaschir, entered
upon his reign, and placed the crown upon his head; and this
was Sunday, the first day of Nisan (March 20, 241), when
the sun stood in the sign Aries. He was accompanied by two
men, who had already attached themselves to his religion;
one was called Simeon, the other Zakwa; besides these, his
father accompanied him, to see how his affairs would turn
out.
</p>

<p>
Mani said he was the Paraclete, whom Jesus, of blessed
memory,<note place="foot">The author is a Moslem, and therefore
speaks of Jesus with great respect; Mani regarded Jesus as evil.</note>
had previously announced. Mani took the elements
of his doctrine from the religion of the Magi and Christianity.…
Before he met Sapor Mani had spent about
forty years in foreign lands.<note place="foot">This is undoubtedly a mistake.</note>
Afterward he converted Peroz,
the brother of Sapor, and Peroz procured him an audience
with his brother Sapor. The Manichæans relate: He thereupon
entered where he was and on his shoulders were shining,
as it were, two candles. When Sapor perceived him, he was
filled with reverence for him, and he appeared great in his
eyes; although he previously had determined to seize him
and put him to death. After he had met him, therefore, the
fear of him filled him, he rejoiced over him and asked him why
he had come and promised to become his disciple. Mani requested
of him a number of things, among them that his
followers might be unmolested in the capital and in the other
territories of the Persian Empire, and that they might extend
themselves whither they wished in the provinces. Sapor
granted him all he asked.
</p>

Mani had already preached in India, China, and among the
inhabitants of Turkestan, and in every land he left behind
him disciples.<note place="foot">Important material has been recently

of an extended statement of Mani's teaching. But it is hoped
that enough is given to show the mythological character of his speculation.
The bulk of his doctrine was Persian and late Babylonian,
and the Christian element was very slight. It is clear from the writings
of St. Augustine that the doctrine changed much in later years in the
West.
</quote>

<p>
The doctrine of Mani, especially his dogmas of the Eternal,
to whom be praise and glory, of the creation of the world and
the contest between Light and Darkness: Mani put at the
beginning of the world two eternal principles. Of these one
is Light, the other Darkness. They are separated from each
other. As to the Light, this is the First, the Mighty One, and
the Infinite. He is the Deity, the King of the Paradise of
Light. He has five members or attributes, namely, gentleness,
wisdom, understanding, discretion, and insight; and
further five members or attributes, namely, love, faith, truth,
bravery, and wisdom. He asserts that God was from all
eternity with these attributes. Together with the Light-God
there are two other things from eternity, the air and the earth.
</p>

<p>
Mani teaches further: The members of the air, or the Light-Ether,
are five: gentleness, wisdom, understanding, discretion,
and insight. The members of the Light-Earth are the
soft gentle breath, the wind, the light, the water, and the
fire. As to the other Original Being, the Darkness, its members
are also five: the vapor, the burning heat, the fiery wind,
the poison, and the darkness.
</p>

<p>
This bright shining Primal Being was in immediate proximity
with the dark Primal Being, so that no wall of partition
was between them and the Light touched the Darkness on its
broad side. The Light is unlimited in its height, and also to
the right hand and to the left; the Darkness, however, is unlimited
in its depth, and also to the right hand and to the left.
</p>

<p>
From this Dark-Earth rose Satan, not so that he himself
was without beginning, although his parts were in their elements
<pb n='256'/><anchor id='Pg256'/>
without beginning. These parts joined themselves
together from the elements and formed themselves into Satan.
His head was like that of a lion, his trunk like that of a dragon,
his wings as those of a bird, his tail like that of a great fish,
and his four feet like the feet of creeping things. When this
Satan had been formed from the Darkness—his name is the
First Devil—then he began to devour and to swallow up and
to ruin, to move about to the right and to the left, and to get
down into the deep, so that he continually brought ruin and
destruction to every one who attempted to overmaster him.
Next he hastened up on high and perceived the rays of light,
but felt an aversion to them. Then when he saw how these
rays by reciprocal influence and contact were increased in
brilliancy, he became afraid and crept together into himself,
member by member, and withdrew for union and strengthening
back to his original constituent parts. Now once more
he hastened back into the height, and the Light-Earth noticed
the action of Satan and his purpose to seize and to attack and
to destroy. But when she perceived this thereupon the world
æon of Insight perceived it, then the æon of Wisdom, the
æon of Discretion, the æon of the Understanding, and then
the æon of Gentleness. Thereupon the King of the Paradise
of Light perceived it and reflected on means to gain the mastery
over him. His armies were indeed mighty enough to
overcome him; he had the wish, however, to accomplish this
himself. Therefore he begat with the spirit of his right hand,
with the five æons, and with his twelve elements a creature,
and that was the Primal Man, and him he sent to the conquest
of Darkness.<note place="foot">By primal man is not meant the
first of mankind on earth, but a supernatural being.</note>

<head>Chapter V. The Last Great Persecution</head>

<p>
The last of the persecutions was closely connected with the
increased efficiency of the imperial administration after a
<pb n='257'/><anchor id='Pg257'/>
period of anarchy, and was more effective because of the
greater centralization of the government which Diocletian had
introduced (<ref target="Section_55">§ 55</ref>). It was preceded by a number of minor
persecuting regulations, but broke forth in its full fury in 303,
raging for nearly ten years (<ref target="Section_56">§ 56</ref>). It was by far the most
severe of all persecutions, in extent and duration and severity
surpassing that of Decius and Valerian. As in that persecution,
very many suffered severely, still more lapsed, unprepared
for suffering, as many were in the previous persecution,
and the Church was again rent with dissensions and schisms
arising over the question of the administration of discipline.

<head>§ 55. The Reorganization of the Empire by Diocletian</head>

<p>
After a period of anarchy Diocletian (284-305) undertook a
reorganization of the Empire for the sake of greater efficiency.
Following a precedent of earlier successful emperors, he
shared (285) the imperial authority with a colleague, Maximianus,
who in 286 became Augustus of the West. As the
greatest danger seemed to lie in the East, Diocletian retained
the Eastern part of the Empire, and having already abandoned
Rome as the imperial residence (284), he settled in Nicomedia
in Bithynia. To provide for a succession to the throne more
efficient than the chance succession of natural heirs, two
Cæsars were appointed in 293, Constantius Chlorus for the
West, and Galerius, the son-in-law of Diocletian, for the East.
Constantius at once became the son-in-law of Maximianus.
These Cæsars were to ascend the throne when the <hi rend='italic'>Augusti</hi>
resigned after twenty years' reign. The scheme worked temporarily
for greater efficiency, but ended in civil war as the
claims of natural heirs were set aside in favor of an artificial
dynasty. At the same time the system bore heavily
<pb n='258'/><anchor id='Pg258'/>
upon the people and the prosperity of the Empire rapidly declined.

<p>
When Diocletian, the author of crimes and deviser of evils,
was ruining all things, not even from against God could he
withhold his hand. This man, partly by avarice and partly
by timidity, overturned the world. For he made three persons
sharers with him in the government. The Empire was
divided into four parts, and armies were multiplied, since each
of the four princes strove to have a much larger military force
than any emperor had had when one emperor alone carried
on the government. There began to be a greater number of
those who received taxes than of those who paid them; so
that the means of the husbandmen were exhausted by enormous
impositions, the fields were abandoned, and cultivated
grounds became woodlands, and universal dismay prevailed.
Besides, the provinces were divided into minute portions and
many presidents and prefects lay heavy on each territory, and
almost on every city. There were many stewards and masters
and deputy presidents, before whom very few civil causes
came, but only condemnations and frequent forfeitures, and
exactions of numberless commodities, and I will not say often
repeated, but perpetual and intolerable, wrongs in the exacting
of them.

<head>§ 56. The Diocletian Persecution</head>

<p>
The last great persecution was preceded by a number of
laws aimed to annoy the Christians. On March 12, 295,
all soldiers in the army were ordered to offer sacrifice. In
296 sacred books of the Christians were sought for and burnt
at Alexandria. In 297 or 298 Christian persecutions began
in the army, but the great persecution itself broke out in
303, as described below. Among other reasons for energetic
<pb n='259'/><anchor id='Pg259'/>
measures in which Galerius took the lead, appears to have
been that prince's desire to establish the unity of the Empire
upon a religious basis, which is borne out by his attempts to
reorganize the heathen worship immediately after the cessation
of the persecution. In April, 311, the edict of Galerius,
known as the Edict of the Three Emperors, put an official
end to the persecution. In parts of the Empire, however,
small persecutions took place and the authorities attempted
to attack Christianity without actually carrying on persecutions,
as in the wide-spread dissemination of the infamous
<q>Acts of Pilate,</q> which were posted on walls and spread
through the schools. In the territories of Constantius Chlorus
the persecution had been very light, and there was none
under Constantine who favored Christians from the first.

The outbreak of the persecution.
</quote>

<p>
A fit and auspicious day was sought for the accomplishment
of this undertaking [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the persecution of the Christians];
and the festival of the great god Terminus, celebrated
on the seventh calends of March [Feb. 23], was chosen, to
put an end, as it were, to this religion,
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>That day the first of death, was first of evil's cause</q> (Vergil),</l>
</lg>

<p>
and cause of evils which befell not only the Christians but
the whole world. When that day dawned, in the eighth
consulship of Diocletian and seventh of Maximianus, suddenly,
while it was hardly light, the prefect, together with
the chief commanders, tribunes, and officers of the treasury,
came to the church [in Nicomedia], and when the gates had
<pb n='260'/><anchor id='Pg260'/>
been forced open they sought for an image of God. The
books of the Holy Scriptures were found and burnt; the spoil
was given to all. Rapine, confusion, and tumult reigned.
Since the church was situated on rising ground, and was
visible from the palace, Diocletian and Galerius stood there
as if on a watch-tower and disputed long together whether it
ought to be set on fire. The opinion of Diocletian prevailed,
for he feared lest, when so great a fire should once be started,
the city might be burnt; for many and large buildings surrounded
the church on all sides. Then the prætorian guard,
in battle array, came with axes and other iron instruments,
and having been let loose everywhere, in a few hours they
levelled that very lofty building to the ground.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 13. Next day the edict was published ordaining that
men of the Christian religion should be deprived of all honors
and dignities; and also that they should be subjected to torture,
of whatsoever rank or position they might be; and that
every suit of law should be entertained against them; but they,
on the other hand, could not bring any suit for any wrong,
adultery, or theft; and finally, that they should have neither
freedom nor the right of suffrage. A certain person, although
not properly, yet with a brave soul, tore down this
edict and cut it up, saying in derision: <q>These are the triumphs
of Goths and Samaritans.</q> Having been brought to judgment,
he was not only tortured, but was burnt in the legal
manner, and with admirable patience he was consumed to
ashes.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 14. But Galerius was not satisfied with the terms of
the edict, and sought another way to gain over the Emperor.
That he might urge him to excess of cruelty in persecution,
he employed private agents to set the palace on fire; and
when some part of it had been burnt the Christians were
accused as public enemies, and the very appellation of
Christian grew odious on account of its connection with the
fire in the palace. It was said that the Christians, in concert
with the eunuchs, had plotted to destroy the princes,
<pb n='261'/><anchor id='Pg261'/>
and that both the emperors had well-nigh been burnt alive
in their own palace. Diocletian, who always wanted to
appear shrewd and intelligent, suspecting nothing of the
deception, but inflamed with anger, began immediately to
torture all his domestics.

Ch. 2. It was in the nineteenth year of the reign of Diocletian,
in the month Dystus, called March by the Romans,
when the feast of the Saviour's passion was near at hand, that
royal edicts were published everywhere commanding that
the churches be levelled to the ground, the Scriptures be
destroyed by fire, and all holding places of honor be branded
with infamy, and that the household servants, if they persisted
in the profession of Christianity, be deprived of their
freedom.

<p>
Such was the original edict against us. But not long after
other decrees were issued, commanding that all the rulers of
the churches everywhere should be first thrown into prison,
and afterward compelled by every means to sacrifice.

<p>
Ch. 6:8. Such things occurred in Nicomedia at the
beginning of the persecution. But not long after, as persons
in the country called Melitina and others throughout
Syria attempted to usurp the government, a royal edict commanded
that the rulers of the churches everywhere be thrown
into prison and bonds. What was to be seen after this
exceeds all description. A vast multitude were imprisoned
in every place; and the prisons everywhere, which had long
before been prepared for murderers and grave-robbers, were
filled with bishops, presbyters and deacons, readers and
exorcists, so that room was no longer left in them for those
condemned for crimes. And as other decrees followed the
first, directing that those in prison, if they sacrificed, should
<pb n='262'/><anchor id='Pg262'/>
be permitted to depart from the prison in freedom, but that
those who refused should be harassed with many tortures,
how could any one again number the multitude of martyrs in

Amongst our other measures, which we are always making
for the use and profit of the commonwealth, we have hitherto
endeavored to bring all things into conformity with the
ancient laws and public order of the Romans, and to bring
it about also that the Christians, who have abandoned the
religion of their ancestors, should return to sound reason.
For in some way such wilfulness has seized the Christians
and such folly possessed them that they do not follow those
constitutions of the ancients, which peradventure their own
ancestors first established, but entirely according to their
own judgment and as it pleased them they were making such
laws for themselves as they would observe, and in different
places were assembling various sorts of people. In short,
when our command was issued that they were to betake
themselves to the institutions of the ancients, many of them
were subdued by danger, many also were ruined. Yet when
great numbers of them held to their determination, and we
saw that they neither gave worship and due reverence to the
gods nor yet regarded the God of the Christians, we therefore,
mindful of our most mild clemency and of the unbroken
custom whereby we are accustomed to grant pardon to all
men, have thought that in this case also speediest indulgence
<pb n='263'/><anchor id='Pg263'/>
ought to be granted to them, that the Christians might exist
again and might establish their gatherings, yet so that they
do nothing contrary to good order. By another letter we
shall signify to magistrates how they are to proceed. Wherefore,
in accordance with this our indulgence, they ought to
pray their God for our good estate, for that of the commonwealth,
and for their own, that the commonwealth may endure
on every side unharmed and that they may be able to live
securely in their own homes.

</quote>

<p>
When I, Constantine Augustus, and I, Licinius Augustus,
had happily met together at Milan, and were having under
consideration all things which concern the advantage and
security of the State, we thought that, among other things
which seemed likely to profit men generally, we ought, in the
very first place, to set in order the conditions of the reverence
paid to the Divinity by giving to the Christians and all
others full permission to follow whatever worship any man
had chosen; whereby whatever divinity there is in heaven
may be benevolent and propitious to us, and to all placed
under our authority. Therefore we thought we ought, with
sound counsel and very right reason, to lay down this law,
that we should in no way refuse to any man any legal right
who has given up his mind either to the observance of Christianity
or to that worship which he personally feels best suited
to himself; to the end that the Supreme Divinity, whose
worship we freely follow, may continue in all things to grant
us his accustomed favor and good-will. Wherefore your
devotion should know that it is our pleasure that all provisions
<pb n='264'/><anchor id='Pg264'/>
whatsoever which have appeared in documents hitherto
directed to your office regarding Christians and which appeared
utterly improper and opposed to our clemency should
be abolished, and that every one of those men who have the
same wish to observe Christian worship may now freely and
unconditionally endeavor to observe the same without any
annoyance or molestation. These things we thought it well
to signify in the fullest manner to your carefulness, that you
might know that we have given free and absolute permission
to the said Christians to practise their worship. And when
you perceive that we have granted this to the said Christians,
your devotion understands that to others also a similarly
full and free permission for their own worship and observance
is granted, for the quiet of our times, so that every man may
have freedom in the practice of whatever worship he has
chosen. And these things were done by us that nothing be
taken away from any honor or form of worship. Moreover,
in regard to the Christians, we have thought fit to ordain
this also, that if any appear to have bought, either from our
exchequer or from others, the places in which they were
accustomed formerly to assemble, and concerning which definite
orders have been given before now, and that by letters
sent to your office, the same be restored to the Christians,
setting aside all delay and dispute, without payment or demand
of price. Those also who have obtained them by gift
shall restore them in like manner without delay to the said
Christians; and those, moreover, who have bought them,
as well as those who have obtained them by gift, if they
request anything of our benevolence, they shall apply to the
deputy that order may be taken for them too by our clemency.
All these must be delivered over at once and without delay
by your intervention to the corporation of the Christians.
And since the same Christians are known to have possessed
not only the places where they are accustomed to assemble,
but also others belonging to their corporation, namely, to the
churches and not to individuals, all these by the law which
<pb n='265'/><anchor id='Pg265'/>
we have described above you will order to be restored without
any doubtfulness or dispute to the said Christians—that is, to
their said corporations and assemblies; provided always, as
aforesaid, that those who restore them without price, as we
said, shall expect a compensation from our benevolence. In
all these things you must give the aforesaid Christians your
most effective intervention, that our command may be fulfilled
as soon as may be, and that in this matter also order
may be taken by our clemency for the public quiet. And
may it be, as already said, that the divine favor which we
have already experienced in so many affairs, shall continue
for all time to give us prosperity and successes, together with
happiness for the State. But that it may be possible for
the nature of this decree and of our benevolence to come
to the knowledge of all men, it will be your duty by a proclamation
of your own to publish everywhere and bring to
the notice of all men this present document when it reaches
you, that the decree of this our benevolence may not be
hidden.

<head>§ 57. Rise of Schisms in Consequence of the Diocletian Persecution</head>

<p>
The Diocletian persecution and its various continuations,
on account of the severity of the persecution and its great
extent, seriously strained the organization of the Church for
a time, and in at least three important Church centres gave
rise to schisms, of which two were of some duration. The
causes for these schisms, as in the case of the schisms connected
with the Decian persecution, are to be found in the
confusion caused by the enforced absence of bishops from
their sees and in the administration of discipline. In the
latter point the activity of the confessors no longer plays
any part, as the authority of the bishops in the various communities
is now undisputed by rival. It was a question of
greater or less rigor in readmitting the lapsed to the communion
<pb n='266'/><anchor id='Pg266'/>
of the Church. For the canons of discipline in force
in Alexandria, see the <hi rend='italic'>Canonical Epistle of Peter of Alexandria</hi>,
ANF, VI, 269 <hi rend='italic'>ff.</hi> (MSG, 18:467.) They were regarded
by the rigorist party in Alexandria as too lax. Of the three
schisms known to have arisen from the Diocletian persecution,
that in Alexandria is known as the Meletian schism,
and three selections are given bearing on it. For the proposals
of the Council of Nicæa to bring about a settlement
and union, see the <hi rend='italic'>Epistle of the Synod of Nicæa</hi>, Socrates,
<hi rend='italic'>Hist. Ec.</hi>, I, 9 (given below, <ref target="Section_61">§ 61,
<hi rend='italic'>II</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>b</hi></ref>). The schism continued
until the fifth century. The schism at Rome, known as the
schism of Heraclius, was much less important. It was caused
by the party advocating greater laxity in discipline, and was
for a time difficult to deal with on account of long vacancies
in the Roman episcopate. The duration of the schism could
not have been long, but the solution of the questions raised
by it is unknown. In fact, the history of the Roman church
is exceedingly obscure in the half-century preceding the
Council of Nicæa. The third schism, that of the Donatists
in North Africa, which broke out in Carthage, was the most
considerable in the Church before the schisms arising from
the christological controversies. For the Donatist schism,
see §§ <ref target="Section_61">61</ref>, <ref target="Section_67">67</ref>,

<p>
Hesychius, Pachomius, Theodorus, and Phileas to Meletius,
our friend and fellow-minister in the Lord, greeting. In
simple faith, regarding as uncertain the things which have been
heard concerning thee, since some have come to us and certain
things are reported foreign to divine order and ecclesiastical
rule which are being attempted, yea, rather, which are
being done by thee, we were not willing to credit them when
we thought of the audacity implied by their magnitude, and
we thought that they were uncertain attempts. But since
so many coming to us at the present time have lent some
credibility to these reports, and have not hesitated to attest
them as facts, we, greatly astonished, have been compelled
to write this letter to thee. And what agitation and sadness
have been caused to us all in common and to each of us
individually by the ordination performed by thee in parishes
not pertaining to thee, we are unable sufficiently to express.
We have not delayed, however, by a short statement, to prove
thy practice wrong.
</p>

<p>
In the law of our fathers and forefathers, of which thou also
art not thyself ignorant, it is established, according to the
divine and ecclesiastical order (for it is all for the good pleasure
of God and the zealous regard for better things), that it
has been determined and settled by them that it is not lawful
for any bishop to perform ordinations in other parishes
than his own. This law is exceedingly important and wisely
devised. For, in the first place, it is but right that the conversation
and life of those who are ordained should be examined
with great care; and, in the second place, that all
confusion and turbulence should be done away with. For
every one shall have enough to do in managing his own parish,
and in finding, with great care and many anxieties, suitable
subordinates among those with whom he has passed his whole
life, and who have been trained under his hands. But thou,
considering none of these things, nor regarding the future,
nor considering the law of our holy Fathers and those who
have put on Christ in long succession, nor the honor of our
<pb n='268'/><anchor id='Pg268'/>
great bishop and father, Peter,<note place="foot">Bishop of Alexandria.</note>
on whom we all depend in
the hope which we have in the Lord Jesus Christ, nor softened
by our imprisonments and trials, and daily and multiplied
reproaches, nor the oppressions and distress of all, hast ventured
on subverting all things at once. And what means
will be left for thee for justifying thyself with respect to these
things?
</p>

<p>
But perhaps thou wilt say, I did this to prevent many from
being drawn away with the unbelief of many, because the
flocks were in need and forsaken, there being no pastor with
them. Well, but it is most certain that they were in no such
destitution; in the first place, because there were many going
among them and able to visit them; and, in the second place,
even it there were some things neglected by them, representation
should have come from the people, and we should
have duly considered the matter. But they knew that they
were in no want of ministers, and therefore they did not come
to seek thee. They knew that either we were wont to warn
them from such complaint or there was done, with all carefulness,
what seemed profitable; for it was done under correction
and all was considered with well-approved honesty.
Thou, however, giving such careful attention to the deceits
of certain men and their vain words,<note place="foot">See next selection.</note>
hast, as it were, stealthily
leaped forward to the performance of ordinations. For if,
indeed, those accompanying thee constrained thee to this
and compelled thee and were ignorant of the ecclesiastical
order, thou oughtest to have followed the rule and have informed
us by letter; and in that way what seemed expedient
would have been done. And if perchance some persuaded
thee to credit their story, who said to thee that it was all over
with us—a matter which could not have been unknown to
thee, because there were many passing and repassing by us
who might visit thee—even if this had been so, yet oughtest
thou to have waited for the judgment of the superior father
and his allowance of this thing. But thinking nothing of
<pb n='269'/><anchor id='Pg269'/>
these matters, and hoping something different, or rather
having no care for us, thou hast provided certain rulers for
the people. For now we learn that there are also divisions,
because thy unwarrantable ordination displeased many.
</p>

<p>
And thou wert not readily persuaded to delay such procedure
or restrain thy purpose, no, not even by the word of
the Apostle Paul, the most blessed seer and the man who put
on Christ, the Apostle of us all; for he, in writing to his dearly
loved Timothy, says: <q>Lay hands suddenly on no man,
neither be partaker of other men's sins.</q> [I Tim. 5:22.]
And thus he at once shows his own consideration of him, and
gives his example and exhibits the law according to which,
with all carefulness and caution, candidates are chosen for
the honor of ordination. We make this declaration to thee,
that in the future thou mayest study to keep within the safe
and salutary limits of the law.

was a certain person, Isidorus by name, turbulent in character,
and possessed with the ambition of being a teacher.
And there was also a certain Arius, who wore the habit of
piety and was in like manner possessed with the ambition
of being a teacher. And when they discovered the object of
Meletius's passion and what it was he sought, hastening to
him and regarding with malice the episcopal authority of the

made manifest, they discovered to Meletius certain presbyters,

Meletius, recommending them to improve the opportunity

<head>The Second Division Of Ancient Christianity: The Church Under The
Christian Empire: From 312 To Circa 750</head>

<p>
The second division of the history of ancient Christianity,
or Christianity under the influence of the Græco-Roman type
of culture, begins with the sole rule of Constantine, A. D. 324,
or his sole reign in the West, A. D. 312, and extends to the
beginning of the Middle Ages, or that period in which the
Germanic nations assumed the leading rôle in the political
life of western Europe. The end of this division of Church
history may be placed, at the latest, about the middle of the
eighth century, as the time when the authority of the Eastern
Empire ceased to affect materially the fortunes of the West.
But it is impossible to name any year or reign or political
event as of such outstanding importance as to make it a
<hi rend='italic'>terminus ad quem</hi> for the division which will command the
suffrages of all as the boundary between the ancient and the
mediæval epochs of history.
</p>

<p>
The second division of ancient Christianity may be subdivided
into three periods:
</p>

<p>
I. The Imperial State Church of the Undivided Empire, or
until the Death of Theodosius the Great, or to 395.
</p>

<p>
II. The Church in the Divided Empire until the Collapse of
the Western Empire and the Schism between the
East and the West arising out of the Monophysite
Controversies, or to circa 500.
</p>

<p>
III. The Dissolution of the Imperial Church of the West
and the Transition to the Middle Ages.
</p>

<pb n='273'/><anchor id='Pg273'/>

<p>
In the third period are to be placed the beginnings of the
Middle Ages, as the German invaders had long before 500
established their kingdoms and had begun to dominate the
affairs of the West. But the connection of the Church of
the West, or rather of Italy, with the East was long so close
that the condition of the Church is more that of a dissolution
of the ancient imperial State Church than of a building up
of the mediæval Church. At the same time, the transition
to the Middle Ages, so far as the Church is concerned at least,
takes place under the influence of the ancient tradition, and
institutions are established in which the leading elements,
taken from ancient life, are not yet transformed by Germanic
ideas. The East knew no Middle Age. For a history of the
Eastern Church other divisions would have to be made, but
in a history in which, for practical reasons, the development
is traced in Western Christianity, the affairs of the Eastern
Church must be treated as subordinate to those of Western
Christianity.
</p>

<p>
For the second division of the history of ancient Christianity,
the principal sources available in English are the
translations in <hi rend='italic'>A Select Library of the Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers of the Christian Church</hi>. Edited by Ph. Schaff and H.
Wace. The <hi rend='italic'>First Series</hi> of this collection (PNF, ser. I) contains
the principal works of Augustine and Chrysostom.
The <hi rend='italic'>Second Series</hi> (PNF, ser. II) is for historical study even
more valuable, and gives, generally with very able introductions
and excellent bibliographies, the most important works
of many of the leading patristic writers, including the principal
ecclesiastical historians, as well as Athanasius, Gregory
of Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, Basil the Great, Cyril of
Jerusalem, Hilary of Poitiers, Jerome, Rufinus, Cassian, Vincent
of Lérins, Leo the Great, Gregory the Great, and others.
These translations are in part fresh versions, and in part
older versions but slightly, if at all, revised, taken from the
<hi rend='italic'>Library of the Fathers of the Holy Catholic Church anterior to
the Division of the East and West</hi>, Oxford, 1838, <hi rend='italic'>et seq.</hi>
</p>

<pb n='274'/><anchor id='Pg274'/>

<p>
For the period before the outbreak of the great christological
controversies, the ecclesiastical historians are of great
value. There are no less than four continuations of the
<hi rend='italic'>Ecclesiastical History</hi> of Eusebius accessible: the ecclesiastical
histories of Socrates, 324-439 (ed. R. Hussey, Oxford,
1853); of Sozomen, 324-425 (ed. R. Hussey, Oxford, 1860);
of Rufinus, 324-395, which is appended to a Latin version or
rather revised and <q>edited</q> Latin version of Eusebius; of
Theodoret, 323-428 (ed. Gaisford, Oxford, 1854). Fragments
of the <hi rend='italic'>Ecclesiastical History</hi> of the Arian Philostorgius, from
the appearance of Arius as a teacher until 423, have been translated
and are to be found in Bohn's <hi rend='italic'>Ecclesiastical Library</hi>.
For the period after the Council of Ephesus, A. D. 431, there
is no such abundance, but Evagrius, of whose history (ed.
Parmentier and Bidez, London, 1898) there is a translation
in Bohn's <hi rend='italic'>Ecclesiastical Library</hi>, though not in PNF, is of
great value as he gives many original documents; and a portion
of the <hi rend='italic'>Ecclesiastical History</hi> of John of Ephesus (trans. by
R. P. Smith, Oxford, 1860) carries the history to about 600.
There are also works devoted to the history of the West by
Gregory of Tours, the Venerable Bede, and Paulus Diaconus,
and others of the greatest value for the third period of this
division. They will be mentioned in their place.
</p>

<p>
As the series of the great church councils begins with the
Christian Empire, the <hi rend='italic'>History of the Councils</hi>, by Hefele,
becomes indispensable to the student of ecclesiastical history,
not only for its narrative but for the sources epitomized or
given in full. It has been translated into English as far as
the close of the eighth century, or well into the beginnings
of the history of the mediæval Church. The new French
translation should be used if possible as it contains valuable
additional notes. In connection with Hefele may be
used:
</p>

<p>
Percival, <hi rend='italic'>The Seven Ecumenical Councils</hi>, in PNF, ser. II,
vol. XIV.
</p>

<p>
Wm. Bright, <hi rend='italic'>Notes on the Canons of the First Four General
<pb n='275'/><anchor id='Pg275'/>
Councils</hi>, 1882, should be consulted for this period. Bruns,
<hi rend='italic'>op. cit.</hi>, and Lauchert, <hi rend='italic'>op. cit.</hi>,
give texts only.

<p>
The two great collections of secular laws are:
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Codex Theodosianus</hi>, ed. Mommsen and Meyer, Berlin, 1905.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Corpus Juris Civilis</hi>, ed. Krüger, Mommsen, Schoell, and
Knoll, Berlin, 1899-1902.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>The Cambridge Medieval History</hi>, vol. I, 1912, covers the
period beginning with Constantine and extending to the beginning
of the fifth century. It contains valuable bibliographies
of a more discriminating character than those in the
<hi rend='italic'>Cambridge Modern History</hi>, and render bibliographical
references unnecessary. To this the student is accordingly
referred for such matters. The second volume of this work
will cover the period 500-850.

<head>Period I: The Imperial State Church Of The Undivided Empire, Or Until The
Death Of Theodosius The Great, 395</head>

<p>
The history of the Church in the first period of the second
division of the history of ancient Christianity has to deal
primarily with three lines of development, viz.: first, the
relation of the Church to the imperial authority and the
religious forces of the times, whereby the Church became
established as the sole authorized religion of the Empire, and
heathenism and heresy were prohibited by law; secondly,
the development of the doctrinal system of the Church until
the end of the Arian controversy, whereby the full and eternal
deity of the Son was established as the Catholic faith; thirdly,
the development of the constitution, the fixation of the leading
ecclesiastical conceptions, and the adaptation of the system
of the Church to the practical needs of the times. The
entire period may be divided into two main parts by the
reign of Julian the Apostate (361-363); and the reign of Constantine
as Emperor of the West (312-324) may be regarded
as a prelude to the main part of the history. On the death
of Theodosius the Great in 395, the Empire became permanently
divided, and though in the second period the courses
of the Church in the East and in the West may be treated to
some extent together, yet the fortunes, interests, and problems
of the two divisions of the Church begin to diverge.
</p>

<div>

<index index="pdf"/>
<head>Chapter I. The Church And Empire Under Constantine</head>

<p>
Constantine was the heir to the political system of Diocletian.
The same line of development was followed by him
<pb n='277'/><anchor id='Pg277'/>
and his sons, and with increasing severity the burden pressed
upon the people. But the Church, which had been fiercely
persecuted by Diocletian and Galerius, became the object
of imperial favor under Constantine. At the same time in
many parts of the Empire, especially in the West, the heathen
religion was rooted in the affections of the people and everywhere
it was bound up with the forms of state. The new
problems that confronted Constantine on his accession to
sole authority in the West, and still more when he became
sole Emperor, were of an ecclesiastical rather than a civil
character. In the administration of the Empire he followed
the lines laid down by Diocletian (<ref target="Section_58">§ 58</ref>). But in favoring
the Church he had to avoid alienating the heathen majority.
This he did by gradually and cautiously extending to the
Church privileges which the heathen religion had enjoyed
(<ref target="Section_59">§ 59</ref>), and with the utmost caution repressing those
elements in heathenism which might be plausibly construed as inimical
to the new order in the state (<ref target="Section_60">§ 60</ref>). At the same time,
Constantine found in the application of his policy to actual
conditions that he could not favor every religious sect that
assumed the name of Christian. He must distinguish between
claimants of his bounty. He must also bring about a
unity in the Church where it had been threatened (<ref target="Section_61">§ 61</ref>),
and repress what might lead to schism. Accordingly he
found himself, immediately after his accession to sole authority,
engaged in ecclesiastical discussions and adjudicating by
councils ecclesiastical cases (<ref target="Section_62">§ 62</ref>).
</p>

<anchor id="Section_58"/>
<head>§ 58. The Empire under Constantine and His Sons</head>

<p>
Constantine became sole Emperor of the West, 312, and by
the defeat of Licinius, July 23, 324, sole ruler of the entire
Roman Empire. On his death, May 22, 337, his three sons
divided between them the imperial dignity: Constantine II
(337-340), taking Gaul, Spain, and Britain; Constans
(337-350), Italy, Africa, and Illyria, and in 340 receiving the share
<pb n='278'/><anchor id='Pg278'/>
of Constantine II; Constantius (337-361), taking the East,
including Egypt. Of these three the ablest was Constantius
who, after the renewed Persian war (337-350), became, on
the death of Constans, sole Emperor. Although the imperial
authority was divided and the ecclesiastical policy of each
Emperor followed the religious condition and theological complexion
of his respective portion of the Empire, the social conditions
were everywhere much the same. There were under
Constantine and also under his sons the continuation of that
centralization which had already been carried far by Diocletian,
the same court ceremonial and all that went with it,
and the development of the bureaucratic system of administration.
The economic conditions steadily declined as the
imperial system became constantly more burdensome (<hi rend='italic'>v.
supra</hi>, <ref target="Section_55">§ 55</ref>), and
the changes in the distribution of wealth and the
administration of landed property affected disastrously
large sections of the populace. A characteristic feature
of Roman society, which affected the position of the
Church not a little, was the tendency to regard callings and
trades as hereditary, and by the fourth century this was
enforced by law. The aim of this legislation was to provide
workmen to care for the great public undertakings for the
support of the populace of the cities and for the maintenance
of the public business. This policy affected both the humble
artisan and the citizen of curial rank. The former, although
given various privileges, was crushed down by being obliged
to continue in what was often an unprofitable occupation;
the latter was made responsible for the taxes and various
public burdens which custom, gradually becoming law, laid
upon him. Constant attempt was made by great numbers
to escape these burdens and disabilities by recourse to other
occupations, and especially to the Christian ministry with
its immunities (see <ref target="Section_59_c">§ 59,
<hi rend='italic'>c</hi></ref>). Constant legislation endeavored
to prevent this and restore men to their hereditary places.
The following extracts from the Theodosian Code are enactments
of Constantine, and are intended to illustrate the condition,
<pb n='279'/><anchor id='Pg279'/>
under that Emperor, of the law as to hereditary occupations
and guilds, and the position of the curiales, so as to
explain the law as to admission to the priesthood.

<p>
Neither on his conversion nor on his attainment of the sole
rule of the Empire did Constantine establish the Church as
the one official religion of the State. The ruler himself professed
the Christian religion and neither abolished the former
religion of the State nor disestablished it. But he granted to
his own religion favors similar to those enjoyed by the heathen
religious systems (<hi rend='italic'>a-d</hi>), though these privileges were only
for the Catholic Church, and not for heretics
(<ref target="Section_59_e"><hi rend='italic'>e</hi></ref>); and he passed
such laws as would make it possible for Christians to carry out
their religious practices, <hi rend='italic'>e.g.</hi>, that Christians should not be
compelled to sacrifice when the laws prescribed sacrifices
(<ref target="Section_59_f"><hi rend='italic'>f</hi></ref>),

Since it is our pleasure that something should be granted in

firmness three thousand folles.<note place="foot">A folle was a sum

seemed good to me, most esteemed Anulinus, that those men
who give their services with due sanctity and with constant
observance of this law to the worship of the divine religion
should receive recompense for their labors. Wherefore it is
my will that those within the province intrusted to thee, in
the Catholic Church over which Cæcilianus presides, who give
their services to this holy religion, and who are commonly
called clergymen, be entirely exempted from all public duties,
that by any error or sacrilegious negligence they may not be
drawn away from the service due to the Deity, but may devote
themselves without any hindrance to their own law.
For it seems that when they show greatest reverence to the
Deity the greatest benefits accrue to the State. Farewell, our
most esteemed and beloved Anulinus.

<head>§ 60. The Repression of Heathenism under Constantine</head>

<p>
Constantine's religious policy in respect to heathenism may
have been from the first to establish Christianity as the sole
religion of the Empire and to put down heathenism. If so,
in the execution of that policy he proceeded with great caution,
especially in the period before his victory over Licinius.
It looks at times as if for a while he aimed at a parity of religions.
Certain is the fact that only as conditions became more
favorable to active measures of repression he increased the
severity of his laws against what was of doubtful legality
in heathenism, though he was statesman enough to recognize
the difference in the religious conditions between the East and
the West, especially as to the hold which Christianity had
upon the mass of the people. While his measures in the East
<pb n='286'/><anchor id='Pg286'/>
became constantly harsher, in the West he tolerated heathenism.
The commonly received theory is that Constantine
changed his policy. All the facts can be as easily understood
on the hypothesis that as a statesman he had constant regard
to the advisability of drastic execution of a policy which he in
theory accepted and would have carried out in its entirety
everywhere if he had been able.

<head>§ 61. The Donatist Schism under Constantine</head>

<p>
The Donatist schism arose in connection with the Diocletian
persecution, in part over the policy of Mensurius of
Carthage regarding the fanatical desire for martyrdom and
the delivery of the sacred books according to the edict of persecution.
Combined with this were the personal ambitions
of the Archdeacon Cæcilianus, the offended dignity of the
Primas of Numidia, Bishop Secundus of Tigisi, and the
pique of a wealthy female devotee, Lucilla. It was mixed up
with the customs of the North African church, whereby the
Primas of Numidia exercised a leading authority in the conduct
of the election of the bishop of Carthage, and also with
the notion prevalent in the same church, for which also Cyprian
contended in the controversy on the baptism of heretics
[see <ref target="Section_52">§ 52</ref>], that the
validity of a sacrament depended in some
way upon the personal character of the minister of that sacrament.
It was asserted by the partisans of Secundus, who
elected Majorinus bishop of Carthage, that Felix of Aptunga,
the consecrator of Cæcilianus, who had been elected by the
other party, had delivered the sacred books to the heathen
officials, and was therefore guilty as a traditor. A schism,
accordingly, arose in Carthage which spread rapidly throughout
North Africa. The party of Majorinus soon came under
the lead of Donatus the Great, his successor in the schismatical
see of Carthage. The Donatist schism became of importance
almost at once, and as it was inconsistent with Constantine's
religious policy, which called for Church unity,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>V.
infra</hi>, <ref target="Section_62">§ 62</ref>, Introduction.</note> it
presented an immediate difficulty in the execution of laws
granting favors to the Catholic Church.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>V.
supra</hi>, <ref target="Section_59">§§ 59 <hi rend='italic'>f.</hi></ref></note>
On account of the
interests involved, the schism was of long duration, lasting
after the conquest of North Africa by the Vandals, and
<pb n='288'/><anchor id='Pg288'/>
even to the Saracen conquest, though long since of no importance.

<head>§ 62. Constantine's Endeavors to Bring about the
Unity of the Church by Means of General Synods:
The Councils of Arles and Nicæa</head>

<p>
One of the intentions of Constantine in his support of Christianity
seems to have been the employment of the Christian
religion as a basis for imperial unity. The policy of several
earlier emperors in reviving heathenism, and Galerius in his
persecution of the Christians, seems likewise to have been to
use religion as a basis of unity. One of the first tasks Constantine
encountered after he became sole ruler of the West
was to restore the unity of the Church in Africa, which had
been endangered by the disputes culminating in the Donatist
schism; and when he became sole ruler of the Empire a new
task of a similar character was to restore unity to the Church
of the East, endangered by the Meletian schism in Egypt [<hi rend='italic'>v.
supra</hi>, <ref target="Section_57_a">§ 57, <hi rend='italic'>a</hi></ref>],
the Arian controversy in its first stage [<hi rend='italic'>v. infra</hi>,
<ref target="Section_63">§ 63</ref>], and the estrangement of the Asia
Minor churches, due to the Easter controversy [<hi rend='italic'>v. supra</hi>,
<ref target="Section_38">§ 38</ref>]. It was a master-stroke
of policy on the part of Constantine to use the Church's
conciliar system on an enlarged scale to bring about this unity.
The Church was made to feel that the decision was its own
and to be obeyed for religious reasons; at the same time the
Emperor was able to direct the thought and action of the
assembly in matters of consequence and to give to conciliar
action legal and coercive effect. The two great assemblies
summoned to meet the problems of the West and of the East
were respectively the Councils of Arles, A. D. 314, and of
Nicæa, A. D. 325.

Constantine Augustus to Chrestus, Bishop of Syracuse.
When some began wickedly and perversely to disagree among
themselves in regard to the holy worship and the celestial
power and Catholic doctrine, I, wishing to put an end to such
disputes among them, formerly gave command that certain
bishops should be sent from Gaul, and that the opposing
parties, who were contending persistently and incessantly with
each other, should be summoned from Africa; that in their
presence and in the presence of the bishop of Rome the matter
which appeared to be causing the disturbance might be
examined and decided with all care. But since, as it happens,
some, forgetful both of their own salvation and of the
reverence due to the most holy religion, do not even yet bring
hostilities to an end, and are unwilling to conform to the judgment
already passed, and assert that those who expressed
their opinions and decisions were few, or that they had been
too hasty and precipitate in giving judgment, before all the
things which ought to have been accurately investigated had
been examined—on account of all this it has happened that
those very ones who ought to hold brotherly and harmonious
relations toward each other are shamefully, or rather abominably,
divided among themselves, and give occasion for ridicule
to those men whose souls are alien as to this most holy
religion. Wherefore it has seemed necessary to me to provide
that this dissension, which ought to have ceased after
the judgment had been already given, by their own voluntary
agreement, should now, if possible, be brought to an end by
the presence of many. Since, therefore, we have commanded
a number of bishops from a great many different places to
assemble in the city of Arles, before the calends of August,
we have thought proper to write to thee also that thou
shouldest secure from the most illustrious Latronianus, Corrector
of Sicily, a public vehicle, and that thou shouldest take
with thee two others of the second rank whom thou thyself
shalt choose, together with three servants, who may serve you
on the way, and betake thyself to the above-mentioned place
before the appointed day; that by thy firmness and by the
<pb n='291'/><anchor id='Pg291'/>
wise unanimity and harmony of the others present, this dispute,
which has disgracefully continued until the present
time, in consequence of certain shameful strifes, after all has
been heard, which those have to say who are now at variance
with one another, and whom we have likewise commanded
to be present, may be settled in accordance with the proper
faith, and that brotherly harmony, though it be but gradual,
may be restored. May Almighty God preserve thee in
health many years.

laid upon him that he might receive the Holy Ghost. That

<p>
To the holy and, by the grace of God, great Church of the
Alexandrians, and to our beloved brethren throughout Egypt,
Libya, and Pentapolis, the bishops assembled at Nicæa constituting
the great and holy synod, send greetings in the Lord.
</p>

<p>
Since by the grace of God, a great and holy synod has been
convened at Nicæa, our most pious sovereign Constantine
having summoned us out of various cities and provinces for
that purpose, it appeared to us indispensably necessary that
a letter should be written also to you on the part of the sacred
synod; in order that you may know what subjects were
brought under consideration, what rigidly investigated, and
also what was eventually determined on and decreed. In
the first place, the impiety and guilt of Arius and his adherents
were examined into, in the presence of our most
pious Emperor Constantine: and it was unanimously decided
that his impious opinion be anathematized, with all the blasphemous
expressions and terms he has blasphemously uttered,
affirming that the Son of God sprang from nothing, and that
there was a time when He was not; saying, moreover, that the
Son of God was possessed of a free will, so as to be capable
either of vice or virtue; and calling Him a creature and a
work. All these the holy synod has anathematized, having
scarcely patience to endure the hearing of such an impious
or, rather, bewildered opinion, and such abominable blasphemies.
But the conclusion of our proceedings against him
you must either have heard or will hear; for we would not
seem to trample on a man who has received the chastisement
which his crime deserved. Yet so strong is his impiety as to
involve Theonas, Bishop of Marmarica, and Secundus of
Ptolemais; for they have suffered the same condemnation
as himself. But the grace of God freed us from this false
doctrine, impiety, and blasphemy, and from those persons who
have dared to cause discord and division among the people
previously at peace; and there still remained the contumacy
of Meletius to be dealt with, and those who had been
ordained by him; and we shall now state to you, beloved
<pb n='294'/><anchor id='Pg294'/>
brethren, what resolution the synod came to on this point.
Acting with more clemency toward Meletius, although, strictly
speaking, he was wholly undeserving of favor, the council
permitted him to remain in his own city, but decreed that he
should exercise no authority either to ordain or nominate for
ordination; and that he should appear in no other district
or city on this pretence, but simply retain a nominal dignity;
that those who had received appointments from him, after
having been confirmed by a more legitimate ordination,
should be admitted to communion on these conditions: that
they should continue to hold their rank and ministry, but
regard themselves as inferior in every respect to all those who
had been previously ordained and established in each place
and church by our most honored fellow-minister Alexander.
In addition to these things, they shall have no authority to
propose or nominate whom they please, or to do anything at
all without the concurrence of a bishop of the Catholic
Church, who is one of Alexander's suffragans. Let such as
by the grace of God and your prayers have been found in no
schism, but have continued in the Catholic Church blameless,
have authority to nominate and ordain those who are worthy
of the sacred office, and to act in all things according to ecclesiastical
law and usage. Whenever it may happen that any
of those placed in the Church die, then let such as have been
recently admitted into orders be advanced to the dignity of
the deceased, provided that they appear worthy, and that
the people should elect them, and the bishop of Alexandria
confirm their choice. This is conceded to all the others,
indeed, but as for Meletius personally we by no means grant
the same, on account of his formerly disorderly conduct; and
because of the rashness and levity of his character he is
deprived of all authority and jurisdiction, as a man liable
again to create similar disturbances. These are things which
specially affect Egypt and the most holy Church of the Alexandrians;
and if any other canon or ordinance should be
established, our lord and most honored fellow-minister and
<pb n='295'/><anchor id='Pg295'/>
brother Alexander being present with us, will on his return
to you enter into more minute details, inasmuch as he is not
only a participator in whatever is transacted, but has the
principal direction of it. We have also to announce the good
news to you concerning the unanimity as to the holy feast of
Easter: that this by your prayers has been settled so that all
the brethren in the East, who have hitherto kept this festival
with the Jews, will henceforth conform to the Romans and
to us, and to all who from the earliest times have observed our
period of celebrating Easter. Rejoicing, therefore, on account
of a favorable termination of matters and in the extirpation
of all heresy, receive with the greater honor and more
abundant love our fellow-minister and your bishop, Alexander,
who has greatly delighted us by his presence, and
even at his advanced age has undergone extraordinary exertions
in order that peace might be re-established among you.
Pray on behalf of us all, that the decisions to which we have
so justly come may be inviolably maintained through Almighty
God and our Lord Jesus Christ, together with the Holy Spirit
to whom be glory forever. Amen.

Canon 8. Concerning those who call themselves Cathari,
who come over to the Catholic and Apostolic Church, the
great and holy synod decrees that they who are ordained shall
continue as they are among the clergy. But before all things
it is necessary that they should profess in writing that they
will observe and follow the teachings of the Catholic and
Apostolic Church; that is, that they will communicate with
<pb n='296'/><anchor id='Pg296'/>
those who have been twice married and with those who have
lapsed during the persecution, and upon whom a period of
penance has been laid and a time for restoration fixed; so
that in all things they will follow the teachings of the Catholic
Church. Wheresoever, then, whether in villages or in cities,
only these are found who have been ordained, let them remain
as found among the clergy and in the same rank. But
if any come over where there is a bishop or presbyter of the
Catholic Church, it is manifest that the bishop of the Church
must have the dignity of a bishop, and he who was named
bishop by those who are called Cathari shall have the honor of
a presbyter, unless it seem fit to the bishop to share with him
the honor of the title. But if this should not seem good to
him, then shall the bishop provide for him a place as chorepiscopus,
or as presbyter, in order that he may be evidently
seen to be of the clergy, and that in one city there may not
be two bishops.

<head>Chapter II. The Arian Controversy Until The
Extinction Of The Dynasty Of Constantine</head>

<p>
The Arian controversy may be divided into four periods
or stadia:
</p>

<p>
1. From the outbreak of the Arian controversy to the
Council of Nicæa (318-325). In this stadium the positions
of the parties are defined, and the position of the West, in
substantial agreement with that of Alexander and Athanasius,
forced through by Constantine and Hosius at Nicæa
(<ref target="Section_63">§ 63</ref>).
</p>

<p>
2. From the Council of Nicæa to the death of Constantine
(325-337). In this stadium, without the setting aside of the
formula of Nicæa, an attempt is made to reconcile those who
in fact dissented. In this period Constantine, now living in
the East, inclines toward a position more in harmony with
Arianism and more acceptable in the East than was the doctrine
of Athanasius. This is the period of the Eusebian
reaction (<ref target="Section_64">§ 64</ref>).
</p>

<p>
3. From the death of Constantine to the death of Constantius
(337-361). In this stadium the anti-Nicæan party
is victorious in the East (<ref target="Section_65">§ 65</ref>),
but as it included all those
who for any reason were opposed to the definition of Nicæa,
it fell apart on attaining the annulment of the decision of
Nicæa. There arose, on the one hand, an extreme Arian
party and, on the other, a homoiousian party which approximated
closely to the Athanasian position but feared the
Nicene terminology.
</p>

<p>
4. From the accession of Julian to the council of Constantinople
(361-381). Under the pressure brought against
Christianity by Julian (<ref target="Section_68">§ 68</ref>),
parties but little removed from each other came closer together
(<ref target="Section_70">§ 70</ref>). A new generation
of theologians took the lead, with an interpretation of the
Nicene formula which made it acceptable to those who had
previously regarded it as Sabellian. And under the lead of
these men, backed by the Emperor Theodosius, the reaffirmation
<pb n='298'/><anchor id='Pg298'/>
of the Nicene formula at Constantinople, 381, was
accepted by the East (<ref target="Section_71">§ 71</ref>).
</p>

<p>
In the period in which the Arian controversy is by far the
most important series of events in Church history, the attitude
of the sons of Constantine toward heathenism and
Donatism was of secondary importance, but it should be
noticed as throwing light on the ecclesiastical policy which
made the Arian controversy so momentous. In their policy
toward heathenism and dissent, the policy of Constantine
was carried to its logical completion in the establishment of
Christianity as the only lawful religion of the Empire
(<ref target="Section_67">§ 67</ref>).
</p>

<p>
Arianism may be regarded as the last attempt of Dynamistic
Monarchianism (<hi rend='italic'>v. supra</hi>, <ref target="Section_40">§ 40</ref>)
to explain the divinity of Jesus Christ without admitting His eternity. It was derived
in part from the teaching of Paul of Samosata through Lucian
of Antioch. Paul of Samosata had admitted the existence
of an eternal but impersonal Logos in God which dwelt in the
man Jesus. Arianism distinguished between a Logos uncreated,
an eternal impersonal reason in God, and a personal
Logos created in time, making the latter, the personal Logos,
only in a secondary sense God. This latter Logos, neither
eternal nor uncreated, became incarnate in Jesus, taking the
place in the human personality of the rational soul or logos.
To guard against the worship of a being created and temporal,
and to avoid the assertion of two eternal existences, the anti-Arian
or Athanasian position, already formulated by Alexander,
made the personal Logos of one essence or substance
with the Father, eternal as the Father, and thereby distinguishing
between begetting, or the imparting of subsistence,
and creating, or the calling into being from nothing, a distinction
which Arianism failed to make; and thus allowing
for the eternity and deity of the Son without detracting from
the monotheism which was universally regarded as the fundamental
doctrine of Christianity as a body of theology. In
this controversy the party of Alexander and Athanasius was
animated, at least in the earlier stages of the controversy,
<pb n='299'/><anchor id='Pg299'/>
not so much by speculative interests as by religious motives,
the relation of Jesus to redemption, and they were strongly
influenced by Irenæus. The party of Arius, on the other hand,
was influenced by metaphysical interests as to the relation
of being to creation and the contrast between the finite and
the infinite. It may be said, in general, that until the council
of Chalcedon, and possibly even after that, the main interest
that kept alive theological discussion was intimately
connected with vital problems of religious life of the times.
After that the scholastic period began to set in and metaphysical
discussions were based upon the formulæ of the
councils.

<head>§ 63. The Outbreak of the Arian Controversy and
the Council of Nicæa, A. D. 325</head>

<p>
The Arian controversy began in Alexandria about 318, as
related by Socrates (<ref target="Section_63_a"><hi rend='italic'>a</hi></ref>).
The positions of the two parties were
defined from the beginning both by Alexander, bishop of
Alexandria (<ref target="Section_63_b"><hi rend='italic'>b</hi></ref>),
and Arius himself (<ref target="Section_63_c"><hi rend='italic'>c</hi></ref>),
who by appealing to Eusebius of Nicomedia, his fellow-student in the school of
Lucian of Antioch, enlisted the support of that able ecclesiastical
politician and courtier and at once extended the area of
the controversy throughout the East. By means of poems
of a somewhat popular character entitled the <hi rend='italic'>Thalia</hi>, about
322 (<ref target="Section_63_d"><hi rend='italic'>d</hi></ref>),
Arius spread his doctrines still further, involving
others than the trained professional theologian. In the meanwhile
Arius and some other clergy sympathizing with him in
Egypt were deposed about 320 (<ref target="Section_63_e"><hi rend='italic'>e</hi></ref>).
Constantine endeavored to end the dispute by a letter, and, failing in this, sent Hosius
of Cordova, his adviser in ecclesiastical matters, to Alexandria
in 324. On the advice of Hosius, a synod was called
to meet at Nicæa in the next year, after the pattern of the
earlier synod for the West at Arles in 314. Here the basis
for a definition of faith was a non-committal creed presented
by Eusebius of Cæsarea, the Church historian
(<ref target="Section_63_f"><hi rend='italic'>f</hi></ref>). This
<pb n='300'/><anchor id='Pg300'/>
was modified, probably under the influence of Hosius, so as
to be in harmony at once with the tenets of the party of
Alexander and Athanasius, and with the characteristic theology
of the West (<ref target="Section_63_g"><hi rend='italic'>g</hi></ref>).

After Peter, who was bishop of Alexandria, had suffered
martyrdom under Diocletian, Achillas succeeded to the episcopal
office, and after Achillas, Alexander succeeded in the
period of peace above referred to. Conducting himself fearlessly,
he united the Church. By chance, one day, in the presence
of the presbyters and the rest of his clergy, he was discussing
too ambitiously the doctrine of the Holy Trinity,
teaching that there was a unity in the Trinity. But Arius,
one of the presbyters under his jurisdiction, a man of no
inconsiderable logical acumen, imagining that the bishop was
subtly introducing the doctrine of Sabellius the Libyan, from
the love of controversy took the opposite opinion to that of
the Libyan, and, as he thought, vigorously responded to the
things said by the bishop. <q>If,</q> said he, <q>the Father begat
the Son, He that was begotten had a beginning of existence;
and from this it is evident that there was a time when the
Son was not. It follows necessarily that He had His subsistence

We believe as the Apostolic Church teaches, In one unbegotten
Father, who of His being has no cause, immutable
and invariable, and who subsists always in one state of being,
admitting neither of progression nor diminution; who gave the
law and the prophets and the Gospel; of patriarchs and
Apostles and all saints, Lord; and in one Lord Jesus Christ,
the only begotten Son of God, begotten not out of that which
is not, but of the Father, who is; yet not after the manner of
material bodies, by severance or emanation, as Sabellius
and Valentinus taught, but in an inexpressible and inexplicable
manner.… We have learned that the Son is immutable
and unchangeable, all-sufficient and perfect, like the Father,
lacking only His <q>unbegottenness.</q> He is the exact and precisely
similar image of His Father.… And in accordance
with this we believe that the Son always existed of the Father.…
Therefore His own individual dignity must be reserved
to the Father as the Unbegotten One, no one being called the
cause of His existence: to the Son, likewise, must be given
the honor which befits Him, there being to Him a generation
from the Father which has no beginning.… And in addition
to this pious belief respecting the Father and the Son,
we confess as the sacred Scriptures teach us, one Holy Spirit,
who moved the saints of the Old Testament, and the divine
teachers of that which is called the New. We believe in one
and only Catholic and Apostolic Church, which can never
be destroyed even though all the world were to take counsel
to fight against it, and which gains the victory over all the
impious attacks of the heterodox.… After this we receive
the resurrection from the dead, of which Jesus Christ our
Lord became the first-fruits; who bore a body, in truth, not
in semblance, derived from Mary, the mother of God [theotokos]
in the fulness of time sojourning among the race, for
the remission of sins: who was crucified and died, yet for all
this suffered no diminution of His Godhead. He rose from

hand of the Majesty on high.

… Alexander has driven us out of the city as atheists,
because we do not concur in what he publicly preaches;
namely, <q>God is always, the Son is always; as the Father so
the Son; the Son coexists unbegotten with God; He is everlastingly
begotten; He is the unbegotten begotten; neither
by thought nor by any interval does God precede the Son;
always God, always the Son; the Son is of God himself.</q>…
To these impieties we cannot listen even though heretics
threaten us with a thousand deaths. But we say and believe
and have taught and do teach, that the Son is not unbegotten,
nor in any way part of the Unbegotten; nor from any
substance [hypokeimenon],<note place="foot">ὑποκείμενον.</note>

counsel He has subsisted before time and before ages, as perfect
God only begotten and unchangeable, and that before
He was begotten or created or purposed or established He
was not. For He was not unbegotten. We are persecuted
because we say that the Son has a beginning, but that God
is without beginning. This is the cause of our persecution,
and likewise because we say that He is of that which is not.<note

God was not always Father; but there was when God
was alone and was not yet Father; afterward He became a
Father. The Son was not always; for since all things have
come into existence from nothing, and all things are creatures
and have been made, so also the Logos of God himself came
into existence from nothing and there was a time when He was
not; and that before He came into existence He was not;
but He also had a beginning of His being created. For God,
he says, was alone and not yet was there the Logos and Wisdom.
Afterward He willed to create us, then He made a
certain one and named Him Logos and Wisdom and Son, in
order that by Him He might create us. He says, therefore,
that there are two wisdoms, one proper to, and existing together
with, God; but the Son came into existence by that wisdom,
and was made a partaker of it and was only named Wisdom
and Logos. For Wisdom existed by wisdom and the will of
God's wisdom. So, he says, that there is another Logos
besides the Son in God, and the Son partaking of that Logos
is again named Logos and Son by grace.… There are many
powers; and there is one which is by nature proper to God
and eternal; but Christ, again, is not the true power of God,
but is one of those which are called powers, of whom also the
locust and the caterpillar are called not only a power but a
great power [Joel 2:2], and there are many other things like to
the Son, concerning whom David says in the Psalms: <q>The
Lord of Powers</q>;<note place="foot">Psalm 24:10; Hebrew,
The Lord of Hosts; LXX, The Lord of Powers.</note>
likewise the Logos is mutable, as are all
<pb n='304'/><anchor id='Pg304'/>
things, and by His own free choice, so far as He wills, remains
good; because when He wills He is able to change, as also
we are, since His nature is subject to change. Then, says
he, God foreseeing that He would be good, gave by anticipation
to Him that glory, which as a man He afterward had
from His virtue; so that on account of His works, which God
foresaw, God made Him to become such as He is now.

Those who became apostates were Arius, Achillas, Æithales,

Gaius, who were then deacons; and with them Secundus and
Theonas, then called bishops. And the novelties which they
have invented and put forth contrary to the Scriptures are
the following: God was not always a Father, but there was a
time when He was not a Father. The Logos of God was not
always, but came into existence from things that were not;
wherefore there was a time when He was not; for the Son
is a creature and a work. Neither is He like in essence to
the Father. Neither is He truly by nature the Logos of the
Father; neither is He His true Wisdom; but He is one of the
things made and created, and is called the Logos and Wisdom
by an abuse of terms, since He himself originated by God's
own logos and by the wisdom that is in God, by which God
has made not only all things but Him also. Wherefore He is
in His nature subject to change and variation as are all rational
creatures. And the Logos is foreign, is alien and separated
from the being [<foreign lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">ousia</foreign>]
of God. And the Father cannot be<note place="foot">Some texts
insert <q>seen nor.</q></note>
<pb n='305'/><anchor id='Pg305'/>
described by the Son, for the Logos does not know the Father
perfectly and accurately, neither can He see Him perfectly.
Moreover, the Son knows not His own essence as it really is;
for He was made on account of us, that God might create us
by Him as by an instrument; and He would not have existed
had not God willed to create us. Accordingly some one asked
them whether the Logos of God is able to change as the
devil changed, and they were not afraid to say that He can
change; for being something made and created, His nature
is subject to change.

<head>§ 64. The Beginnings of the Eusebian Reaction under
Constantine</head>

<p>
Shortly after the Council of Nicæa, Constantine seems to
have become aware of the fact that the decision at that council
was not acceptable in the East as a whole, representing, as
it did, what was generally felt to be an extreme position. In
coming to this opinion he was much influenced by Eusebius
of Nicomedia who, by powerful court interest, was soon recalled
from exile and even became the leading ecclesiastical
adviser of Constantine. The policy of this bishop was to
prepare the way for the revocation of the decree of Nicæa by
a preliminary rehabilitation of Arius
(<ref target="Section_64_a"><hi rend='italic'>a</hi></ref>), and by attacking the
leaders of the opposite party
(<ref target="Section_64_b"><hi rend='italic'>b</hi></ref>). Constantine, however,
never consented to the abrogation of the creed of Nicæa.

The attack of the Arians upon Athanasius and his party.
</quote>

<p>
The partisans of Eusebius and Theognis having returned
from their exile, they received again their churches, having
expelled, as we observed, those who had been ordained in
their stead. Moreover they came into great consideration
with the Emperor, who honored them exceedingly, as those
who had returned from error to the orthodox faith. They,
however, abused the license granted them by exciting commotions
in the world greater than before; being instigated
to this by two causes—on the one hand, the Arian heresy
with which they had been previously infected, and on the
other hand, by animosity against Athanasius because in the
synod he had so vigorously withstood them in the discussion
of the articles of the faith. And in the first place they objected
to the ordination of Athanasius, not only as of one unworthy
of the episcopate, but also as of one not elected by qualified
persons. But when he had shown himself superior to this
calumny (for having assumed direction of the Church of the
Alexandrians, he ardently contended for the Nicene creed),
then the adherents of Eusebius exerted themselves to cause
the removal of Athanasius and to bring Arius back to Alexandria;
for thus only did they think they should be able to
cast out the doctrine of consubstantiality and introduce
Arianism. Eusebius therefore wrote to Athanasius to receive
Arius and his adherents; and when he wrote he not only entreated
him, but he openly threatened him. When Athanasius
would by no means accede to this he endeavored to persuade
<pb n='309'/><anchor id='Pg309'/>
the Emperor to receive Arius in audience and then permit
him to return to Alexandria; and how he accomplished these
things I shall tell in its proper place.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, before this, another commotion was raised in
the Church. In fact those of the household of the Church
again disturbed her peace. Eusebius Pamphilius says that
immediately after the synod Egypt became agitated by intestine
divisions; but he does not give the reason for this.
From this he has gained the reputation of being disingenuous
and of avoiding the specification of the causes of these dissensions
from a determination on his part not to give his sanction
to the proceedings at Nicæa. Yet as we ourselves have
discovered from various letters which the bishops wrote to
one another after the synod, the term homoousios troubled
some of them. So that while they occupied themselves about
it, investigating it very minutely, they roused the strife against
each other. It seemed not unlike a contest in the dark; for
neither party appeared to understand distinctly the grounds
on which they calumniated one another. Those who objected
to the word homoousios conceived that those who approved
it favored the opinion of Sabellius and Montanus; they therefore
called them blasphemers, as subverting the existence of
the Son of God. And again those who defended the term,
charging their opponents with polytheism, inveighed against
them as introducers of heathen superstitions. Eustathius,
bishop of Antioch, accuses Eusebius Pamphilius of perverting
the Nicene creed; Eusebius again denies that he violates
that exposition of the faith, and accuses Eustathius of introducing
the opinion of Sabellius. Therefore each of them
wrote as if contending against adversaries; but both sides
admitted that the Son of God has a distinct person and existence,
confessing that there is one God in three persons
(hypostases) yet they were unable to agree, for what cause I
do not know, and could in no way be at peace.

<head>§ 65. The Victory of the Anti-Nicene Party in the East</head>

<p>
When Constantine died in 337 the party of Eusebius of
Nicomedia was completely in the ascendant in the East. A
council at Antioch, 339, deposed Athanasius, and he was
expelled from Alexandria, and Gregory of Cappadocia was
consecrated in his place. Athanasius, with Marcellus of
Ancyra and other supporters of the Nicene faith, repaired to
Rome where they were supported by Julius, bishop of Rome,
at a well-attended local council in 340
(<hi rend='italic'><ref target="Section_65_a">a</ref>,
<ref target="Section_65_b">b</ref></hi>). In the East
numerous attempts were made to formulate a confession of
faith which might take the place of the Nicene creed and prove
acceptable to all parties. The most important of these were
produced at the Council of Antioch, 341, at which no less than
four creeds were formulated
(<hi rend='italic'><ref target="Section_65_c">c</ref>,

The Eusebians wrote also to Julius, thinking to frighten
me, requesting him to call a council, and Julius himself to be

Julius wrote to the Eusebians, as was suitable, and sent moreover
two of his presbyters, Elpidius and Philoxenus. But
when they heard of me they became confused, because they
did not expect that we would come up; and they declined,
alleging absurd reasons for so doing, but in truth fearing lest
the things should be proved against them which Valens and

§ 26. … It is necessary for me to inform you that although
I alone wrote, yet it was not my opinion only, but of
all the bishops throughout Italy and in these parts. I, indeed,
was unwilling to cause them all to write, lest they might have
weight by mere numbers. The bishops, however, assembled
on the appointed day, and agreed in these opinions, which I
again write to signify to you; so that, dearly beloved, although
I alone address you, yet you may know it is the opinion
of all.…
</p>

<p>
§ 27. That we have not admitted to our communion our
fellow-bishops Athanasius and Marcellus either hastily or unjustly,
although sufficiently shown above, it is but fair to
set briefly before you. The Eusebians first wrote against
Athanasius and his fellows, and you have also written now;
but many bishops out of Egypt and other provinces wrote in
his favor. Now in the first place, your letters against him
contradict each other, and the second have no sort of agreement
with the first, but in many instances the former are
refuted by the latter, and the latter are impeached by the
former.…
</p>

<p>
§ 29. Now when these things were thus represented, and
so many witnesses appeared in his behalf, and so much advanced
by him in his own justification, what did it become
<pb n='312'/><anchor id='Pg312'/>
us to do? Or what did the rule of the Church require except
that we should not condemn the man, but rather receive him
and hold him as a bishop as we have done.…
</p>

<p>
§ 32. With respect to Marcellus, forasmuch as you have
written concerning him also as impious in respect to Christ,
I am anxious to inform you that, when he was here, he positively
declared that what you had written concerning him
was not true; but, being nevertheless requested by us to give
an account of his faith, he answered in his own person with
the utmost boldness, so that we recognize that he maintains
nothing outside of the truth. He confessed that he piously
held the same doctrine concerning our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ as the Catholic Church holds; and he affirmed
that he had held these opinions not merely now but for a very
long time since; as indeed our presbyters, who were at a
former time at the Council of Nicæa, testified to his orthodoxy,
for he maintained both then and now his opposition to
the heresy of Arius; on which point it is right to admonish
you, that none of you admit such heresy, but instead abominate
it as alien from the wholesome doctrine. Since he professed
orthodox opinions and offered testimony to his orthodoxy,
what again ought we in his case to have done except
to treat him as a bishop, as we did, and not reject him from
our communion?…
</p>

<p>
§ 33. For not only the bishops Athanasius and Marcellus
and their fellows came here and complained of the injustice
that had been done them, but many other bishops, also, from
Thrace, from Cœle-Syria, from Phœnicia, and Palestine; and
presbyters, not a few, and others from Alexandria and from
other parts were present at the council here and, in addition
to their own statements, lamented bitterly before all the
assembled bishops the violence and injustice which the
churches had suffered; and they affirmed that outrages similar
to those which had been committed in Alexandria had
occurred not in word only but in deed in their own churches
and in others also.

The Council of Antioch in 341 was gathered ostensibly to dedicate
the great church of that city, in reality to act against the Nicene party.
It was attended by ninety or more bishops of whom thirty-six were
Arians. The others seem to have been chiefly members of the middle
party. The dogmatic definitions of this council have never been
accepted by the Church; on the other hand, the canons on discipline
have always enjoyed a very high place in the esteem of later generations.
The following creed, the second of the Antiochian creeds, is
traditionally regarded as having been composed originally by Lucian
of Antioch, the master of Arius. Hence it is known as the creed of
Lucian.

<p>
We believe in accordance with evangelic and apostolic
tradition in one God the Father Almighty, the creator, the
maker and provider of all things. And in one Lord Jesus
Christ, His only begotten Son, God, through whom are all
things, who was begotten of His Father before all ages, God
of God, whole of whole, only one of only one, perfect of perfect,
king of king, lord of lord, the living word, living wisdom,
true light, way, truth, resurrection, shepherd, door, unchangeable,
unalterable, and immutable, the unchangeable likeness of
the Godhead, both of the substance, and will and power and
glory of the Father, the first-born of all creation, who was in
the beginning with God, God Logos, according to what is said
in the Gospel: <q>and the word was God,</q> through whom all
things were made, and <q>in whom all things consist,</q> who in
the last days came down from above, and was born of a virgin,
according to the Scriptures, and became man, the mediator
between God and man, and the apostle of our faith, and
the prince of life; as He says, <q>I have come down from
heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of Him that
sent me</q>; who suffered for us, and rose the third day and
ascended into heaven and sitteth on the right hand of the
Father, and comes again with glory and power to judge the
<pb n='314'/><anchor id='Pg314'/>
living and the dead. And in the Holy Spirit given for consolation
and sanctification and perfection to those who believe;
as also our Lord Jesus Christ commanded his disciples,
saying, <q>Go ye, teach all nations, baptizing them in the name
of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</q> clearly
of the Father who is really a Father, and of the Son who is
really a Son, and of the Holy Spirit who is really a Holy
Spirit; these names being assigned not vaguely nor idly, but
indicating accurately the special subsistence [hypostasis],
order, glory of those named, so that in subsistence they are
three, but in harmony one.
</p>

<p>
Having then this faith from the beginning and holding it
to the end, before God and Christ we anathematize all heretical
false doctrines. And if any one contrary to the right
faith of the Holy Scriptures, teaches and says that there has
been a time, a season, or age, or being or becoming, before
the Son of God was begotten, let him be accursed. And if
any one says that the Son is a creature as one of the creatures,
or generated as one of the things generated, or made as one
of the things made, and not as the divine Scriptures have
handed down each of the forenamed statements; or if a man
teaches or preaches anything else contrary to what we have
received, let him be accursed. For we truly and clearly both
believe and follow all things from the Holy Scriptures that
have been transmitted to us by the prophets and Apostles.

<head>§ 66. Collapse of the Anti-Nicene Middle Party;
the Renewal of Arianism; the Rise of the Homoousian
Party</head>

<p>
When Constantius became sole Emperor, on the death of
his brother Constans in 350, there was no further need of
considering the interests of the Nicene party. Only the
necessity of establishing his authority in the West against
usurpers engaged his attention until 356, when a series of
councils began, designed to put an end to the Nicene faith.
Of the numerous confessions of faith put forth, the second
creed of Sirmium of 357 is important as attempting to abolish
<pb n='316'/><anchor id='Pg316'/>
in connection with the discussion the use of the term
<foreign lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">ousia</foreign>
and likewise <foreign lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">homoousios</foreign>
and <foreign lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">homoiousios</foreign>
(<ref target="Section_66_a"><hi rend='italic'>a</hi></ref>). At Nice in
Thrace a still greater departure from Nicæa was attempted
in 359, and a creed was put forth
(<ref target="Section_66_b"><hi rend='italic'>b</hi></ref>),
which is of special significance as containing the first reference in a creed to the
<hi rend='italic'>descensus ad inferos</hi> and to the fact that it was subscribed by
the deputies of the West including Bishop Liberius of Rome.
For the discussion of this act of Liberius, see J. Barmby, art.
<q>Liberius</q> in DCB; see also <hi rend='italic'>Catholic Encyclopædia</hi>, art.
<q>Liberius.</q> It was also received in the synod of Seleucia in
the East. On these councils see Athanasius, <hi rend='italic'>De Synodis</hi>
(PNF). It was in reference to this acceptance of the creed
of Nice that Jerome wrote <q>The whole world groaned and
was astonished that it was Arian.</q> See Jerome, <hi rend='italic'>Contra
Luciferianos</hi>, §§ 18 <hi rend='italic'>ff.</hi> (PNF. ser. II, vol. VI).
</p>

<p>
Inasmuch as the anti-Nicene opposition party was a coalition
of all parties opposed to the wording of the Nicene creed,
as soon as that creed was abolished the bond that held them
together was broken. At once there arose an extreme Arianism
which had remained in the background. On the other
hand, those who were opposed to Arianism sought to draw
nearer the Nicene party. These were the Homoiousians, who
objected to the term homoousios as savoring of Sabellianism,
and yet admitted the essential point implied by it. That this
was so was pointed out by Hilary of Poitiers
(<ref target="Section_66_c"><hi rend='italic'>c</hi></ref>) who contended
that what the West meant by homoousios the East
meant by homoiousios. The Homoiousian party of the East
split on the question of the deity of the Holy Spirit. Those of
them who denied the deity of the Spirit remained Semi-Arians.

It is evident that there is one God, the Father Almighty,

</p>

<p>
But since some or many persons were disturbed by questions
as to substance, called in Greek <foreign lang="el"
rend="font-style: italic">ousia</foreign>, that is, to make
it understood more exactly, as to <foreign lang="el"
rend="font-style: italic">homoousios</foreign> or what is
called <foreign lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">homoiousios</foreign>,
there ought to be no mention of these at all, nor
ought any one to state them; for the reason and
consideration that they are not contained in the divine Scriptures,
and that they are above man's understanding, nor can
any man declare the birth of the Son, of whom it is written:
<q>Who shall declare His generation?</q> For it is plain that
only the Father knows how He begat the Son, and the Son
how He was begotten of the Father. There is no question
that the Father is greater. No one can doubt that the
Father is greater than the Son, in honor, dignity, splendor,
majesty and in the very name Father, the Son himself testifying,
He that sent Me is greater than I. And no one is
ignorant that it is Catholic doctrine that there are two persons
of Father and Son; and that the Father is greater, and
that the Son is subordinated to the Father, together with all
things which the Father hath subordinated to Him; and
that the Father has no beginning and is invisible, immortal,
and impassible, but that the Son has been begotten of the
Father, God of God, light of light, and of this Son the generation,
as is aforesaid, no one knows but His Father. And
that the Son of God himself, our Lord and God, as we read,
took flesh or a body, that is, man of the womb of the Virgin
Mary, as the angel announced. And as all the Scriptures
teach, and especially the doctor of the Gentiles himself. He
took of Mary the Virgin, man, through whom He suffered.
And the whole faith is summed up and secured in this, that
the Trinity must always be preserved, as we read in the
Gospel: <q>Go ye and baptize all nations in the name of the
<pb n='318'/><anchor id='Pg318'/>
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</q> Complete
and perfect is the number of the Trinity. Now the Paraclete,
or the Spirit, is through the Son: who was sent and came according
to His promise in order to instruct, teach, and sanctify
the Apostles and all believers.

the Father that begat Him. This only begotten Son of God,
sent by His Father, we know to have come down from heaven,
as it is written, for the destruction of sin and death; begotten
of the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary, as it is written, according
to the flesh. Who companied with His disciples,
and when the whole dispensation was fulfilled, according to
the Father's will, was crucified, dead and buried, and descended
to the world below, at whom hell itself trembled;
on the third day He rose from the dead and companied with
His disciples, and when forty days were completed He was
taken up into the heavens, and sitteth on the right hand of
His Father, and is coming at the last day of the resurrection,
in His Father's glory, to render to every one according to his
works. And in the Holy Ghost, which the only begotten Son
of God, Jesus Christ, both God and Lord, promised to send
to the race of men, the comforter, as it is written, the spirit
of truth, and this Spirit He himself sent after He had ascended

But the word <q>substance,</q> which was simply inserted by

it hath seemed good to us to remove, and that for the future
no mention whatever be permitted of <q>substance,</q> because
the sacred Scriptures nowhere make any mention of the
<q>substance</q> of the Father and the Son. Nor must one
<q>subsistence</q> [hypostasis] be named in relation to the person
[prosopon] of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. And we call the
Son like the Father, as the Holy Scriptures call Him and
teach. But all heresies, both those already condemned, and

Hilary was of great importance in the Arian controversy in bringing
the Homoiousian party of the East and the Nicene party of the West

§ 88. Holy brethren, I understand by homoousios God
of God, not of an unlike essence, not divided, but born; and
that the Son has a birth that is unique, of the substance of

wholly like the Father. The word homoousios greatly helped
me already believing this. Why do you condemn my faith
in the homoousios, which you cannot disapprove by the
confession of the homoiousios? For you condemn my faith,
or rather your own, when you condemn its verbal equivalent.
Does somebody else misunderstand it? Let us together condemn
<pb n='320'/><anchor id='Pg320'/>
the misunderstanding, but not take away the security
of your faith. Do you think that one must subscribe to the
Samosetene Council, so that no one may make use of homoousios
in the sense of Paul of Samosata? Then let us subscribe
to the Council of Nicæa, so that the Arians may not
impugn the word homoousios. Have we to fear that homoiousios
does not imply the same belief as homoousios? Let us
decree that there is no difference between being of one and
being of a similar substance. But may not the word homoousios
be understood in a wrong sense? Let it be proved that
it can be understood in a good sense. We hold one and the
same sacred truth. I beseech you that the one and the same
truth which we hold, we should regard as sacred among us.

<head>§ 67. The Policy of the Sons of Constantine Toward
Heathenism and Donatism</head>

<p>
Under the sons of Constantine a harsher policy toward
heathenism was adopted. Laws were passed forbidding
heathen sacrifices (<hi rend='italic'><ref target="Section_67_a">a</ref>,
<ref target="Section_67_b">b</ref></hi>), and although these were not carried
<pb n='321'/><anchor id='Pg321'/>
out vigorously in the West, where there were many heathen
members of the leading families, they were more generally
enforced in the East, and heathenism was thereby much reduced,
at least in outward manifestations. As to heresy,
the action of the emperors and especially Constantius in his
constant endeavor to set aside the Nicene faith involved
harsh measures against all who differed from the approved
theology of the court. Donatism called for special treatment.
A policy of conciliation was attempted, but on account of
the failure to win over the Donatists and their alliance
with fierce revolutionary fanatics, the Circumcellions, violent
measures were taken against them which nearly extirpated
the sect.

This edict of Constantius is of importance here as it seems to imply

to forbid those celebrated in private. It is, however, the only evidence

Donatistarum</hi>, III, §§ 3, 4. (MSL, 11:999.)</head>

<quote rend="display">
The principal historical writer treating the schism of the Donatists
is Optatus, Bishop of Mileve. His work on this sect was written about
370 and revised and enlarged in 385. It is of primary importance not
merely for the history but for the dogmatic discussions on the doctrine
of the Church, Bk. II, the doctrine of the sacraments, the idea
of <hi rend='italic'>opus operatum</hi> as applied to them,
Bk. V; in all of which he laid the
foundation upon which Augustine built. In addition to the passage
from Optatus given here, Epistles 88 and 185 by Augustine are accessible
in translations and will be found of assistance in filling in the account
of the Circumcellions. The latter is known as <hi rend='italic'>De correctione
Donatistarum</hi> and is published in the anti-Donatist writings of Augustine
in PNF, ser. I, vol. IV; the most important passages are §§
15 and 25. It is probable that the party of the Circumcellions was
originally due to a revolt against intolerable agrarian conditions and
that their association with the Donatists was at first slight.

§ 3. … The Emperor Constans did not send Paulus and
Macarius primarily to bring about unity, but with alms,
that, assisted by them, the poor of the various churches might

<pb n='323'/><anchor id='Pg323'/>
see the military in arms in the proconsular province? Paulus
and Macarius came, everywhere to consider the poor and to
exhort individuals to unity; and when they approached
Bagaja, then another Donatus, bishop of that city, desiring
to place an obstacle in the way of unity and hinder the work
of those coming, whom we have mentioned, sent messengers
throughout the neighboring places and all markets, and summoned
the Circumcellions, calling them Agonistici, to come
to the said place. And at that time the gathering of these
was desired, whose madness a little before had been seen by
the bishops themselves to have been impiously inspired. For
when men of this sort before the unity<note place="foot">The
temporary defeat of the Donatist party which was celebrated at the
Council of Carthage in 348-349. See Hefele, § 70.</note> wandered through
various places, when Axido and Fasir were called by the same
mad ones the leaders of the saints, no one could be secure in
his possessions; written evidences of indebtedness lost their
force; no creditor was at liberty at that time to demand anything.
All were terrified by the letters of those who boasted
that they were the leaders of the saints, and if there was any
delay in fulfilling their commands, suddenly a furious multitude
hurried up and, terror going on before, creditors were
surrounded with a wall of dangers, so that those who ought
to have been asked for their protection were by fear of death
compelled to use humble prayers. Each one hastened to
abandon his most important duties; and profit was thought
to have come from these outrages. Even the roads were no
longer at all safe, because masters, turned out of their carriages,
ran humbly before their slaves sitting in the places of
their masters. By the judgment and rule of these the order
of rank between masters and servants was changed. Therefore
when there arose complaint against the bishops of your
party, they are said to have written to Count Taurinus, that
such men could not be corrected in the Church, and they
demanded that they should receive discipline from the said
count. Then Taurinus, in response to their letters, commanded
<pb n='324'/><anchor id='Pg324'/>
an armed body of soldiers to go through the markets
where the Circumcellions were accustomed to wander. In
Octavum very many were killed, many were beheaded and
their bodies, even to the present day, can be counted by the
white altars or tables.<note place="foot">Tombs built in the
shape of altars which were table-shaped.</note> When first some of their number
were buried in the basilicas, Clarus, a presbyter in Subbulum,
was compelled by his bishop to disinter those buried. Whence
it is reported that what was done had been commanded to be
done, when it is admitted that sepulture in the house of
God is not granted. Afterward the multitude of these people
increased. In this way Donatus of Bagaja found whence
he might lead against Macarius a raging mob. Of that sort
were those who were to their own ruin murderers of themselves
in their desire for a false martyrdom. Of these, also,
were those who rushed headlong and threw themselves down
from the summits of lofty mountains. Behold from what
numbers the second Bishop Donatus formed his cohorts!
Those who were bearing treasure which they had obtained
for the poor were held back by fear. They decided in so
great a predicament to demand from Count Sylvester armed
soldiery, not that by these they should do violence to any one,
but that they might stop the force drawn up by the aforesaid
Bishop Donatus. Thus it happened that an armed soldiery
was seen. Now, as to what followed, see to whom it ought or
can be ascribed. They had there an infinite number of those
summoned, and it is certain that a supply of provisions for a
year had been provided. Of the basilicas they made a sort
of public granary, and awaited the coming of those against
whom they might expend their fury, if the presence of armed
soldiery had not prevented them. For when, before the
soldiers came, the metatores,<note place="foot">The metatores were
those who were sent ahead of a troop of soldiers to provide
for quartering them upon the inhabitants.</note> as was the custom, were sent,
they were not properly received, contrary to the apostolic precept,

to whom tribute, owe no man anything.</q> For those who
<pb n='325'/><anchor id='Pg325'/>
had been sent with their horses were smitten by those whose
names you have made public with malicious intent. They
were the authors of their own wrong; and what they could
suffer they themselves taught by these outrages. The soldiers
who had been maltreated returned to their fellows, and
for what two or three suffered, all grieved. All were roused,
and their officers could not restrain the angered soldiers.

<head>§ 68. Julian the Apostate</head>

<p>
The reign of Julian the Apostate (361-363) is important
in the history of the Christian Church, in the first place, as
indicating the slight hold which heathenism had retained as
a system upon the bulk of the people and the impossibility
of reviving it in any form in which it might compete with the
Church. Julian attempted to inject into a purified heathenism
those elements in the Christian Church which he was
forced to admire. The result was a fantastic mixture of rites
and measures with which the heathen would have nothing to
do. In the second place, in the development of the Church's
doctrinal system, and especially in the Arian controversy, the
reign of Julian gave the contestants, who were obliged to
stand together against a common enemy, reason for examining
in a new way the points they had in common, and enabled
them to see that some at least differed more over the expression
than over the content of their faith. The character
of Julian has long been a favorite subject of study and especially
the motives that induced him to abandon Christianity
for the Neo-Platonic revival of heathenism.

</quote>

<p>
Constantine, who gave Byzantium his own name, had two
brothers born of the same father but by a different mother,
of these one was named Dalmatius, the other Constantius.
Dalmatius had a son of the same name as his own; Constantius
had two sons, Gallus and Julian. Now, as on the
death of Constantine, the founder of Constantinople, the soldiery
had put the younger brother Constantius to death, the
lives of his two orphaned children were also endangered;
but a disease, apparently fatal, preserved Gallus from the
violence of his father's murderers; and as to Julian, his age—for
he was only eight years old at the time—protected him.
The Emperor's jealousy toward them having been subdued,
Gallus attended schools at Ephesus in Ionia, in which country
considerable possessions had been left them by their
parents. Julian, however, when he was grown up pursued
his studies at Constantinople, going constantly to the palace,
where the schools then were, in simple attire and under
the care of the eunuch Mardonius. In grammar, Nicocles,
the Lacedæmonian, was his instructor; and Ecbolius, the
sophist, who was at that time a Christian, taught him rhetoric;
for the Emperor Constantius had made provision that
he should have no pagan masters, lest he should be seduced
to pagan superstitions; for Julian was a Christian at the beginning.
Since he made great progress in literature, the
report began to spread that he was capable of ruling the
Roman Empire; and this popular rumor becoming generally
spread abroad, greatly disquieted the Emperor. Therefore
he removed him from the great city to Nicomedia, forbidding
him at the same time to frequent the school of Libanius the
Syrian sophist. For Libanius, having been driven away by
the teachers of Constantinople, had opened a school at Nicomedia.
Here he gave vent to his indignation against the
<pb n='327'/><anchor id='Pg327'/>
teachers in his treatise composed against them. Julian, however,
was interdicted from being his auditor, because Libanius
was a pagan in religion; nevertheless because he admired
his orations, he procured them and read them secretly and
diligently. As he was becoming very expert in the rhetorical
art, Maximus the philosopher arrived in Nicomedia, not the
Byzantine, Euclid's father, but the Ephesian whom the Emperor
Valentinian afterward caused to be executed as a practicer
of magic. This took place later; at that time the only
thing that attracted him to Nicomedia was the fame of Julian.
Having obtained from him a taste for the principles of philosophy,
Julian began to imitate the religion of his teacher,
who had instilled into his mind a desire for the Empire. When
these things reached the ears of the Emperor, wavering between
hope and fear, Julian became very anxious to lull the
suspicion that had been awakened, and he who was at first
truly a Christian then became one in pretence. Shaved to
the very skin, he pretended to live the monastic life; and
while in private he pursued philosophical studies, in public
he read the sacred writings of the Christian Church. Moreover,
he was appointed reader of the church in Nicomedia.
Thus by these pretexts he escaped the Emperor's displeasure.
Now he did all this from fear, but he by no means abandoned
his hope; telling many of his friends that times would
be happier when he should possess all. While his affairs were
in this condition his brother Gallus, who had been created
Cæsar, when he was on his way to the East came to Nicomedia
to see him. But when Gallus was slain shortly after, Julian
was immediately suspected by the Emperor; therefore the
latter directed that he should be kept under guard; he soon
found means, however, of escaping from his guards, and fleeing
from place to place he managed to be in safety. At last
Eusebia, the wife of the Emperor, having discovered him in
his retreat, persuaded the Emperor to do him no harm, and
to permit him to go to Athens to study philosophy. From
thence—to be brief—the Emperor recalled him and afterward
<pb n='328'/><anchor id='Pg328'/>
created him Cæsar, and having given him his own sister
Helen in marriage, he sent him to Gaul against the
barbarians. For the barbarians whom the Emperor Constantius
had hired as auxiliary forces against Magnentius, being
of no use against that usurper, were pillaging the Roman
cities. Inasmuch as he was young he ordered him to undertake
nothing without consulting the other military chiefs.…
Julian's complaint to the Emperor of the inertness of
his military officers procured for him a coadjutor in the command
more in sympathy with his ardor; and by their combined
efforts an assault was made upon the barbarians. But
they sent him an embassy, assuring him that they had been
ordered by letters of the Emperor to march into Roman territories,
and they showed him the letters. But he cast the
ambassadors into prison, vigorously attacked the forces of
the enemy and totally defeated them; and having taken their
king prisoner, he sent him to Constantius. After these successes
he was proclaimed Emperor by the soldiers; and inasmuch
as there was no imperial crown at hand, one of the
guards took the chain which he wore around his own neck and
placed it upon Julian's head. Thus Julian became Emperor;
but whether he subsequently conducted himself as a philosopher,
let my readers determine. For he neither sent an embassy
to Constantius, nor paid him the least homage in acknowledgment
of past favors; but conducted everything
just as it pleased him. He changed the rulers of the provinces,
and he sought to bring Constantius into contempt by
reciting publicly in every city the letters which Constantius
had written to the barbarians. For this reason the cities
revolted from Constantius and attached themselves to him.
Then he openly put off the pretence of being a Christian;
going about to the various cities, he opened the pagan temples,
offering sacrifices to the idols, and designating himself
<q>Pontifex Maximus</q>; and the heathen celebrated their pagan
festivals with pagan rites. By doing these things he excited
a civil war against Constantius; and thus as far as he was
<pb n='329'/><anchor id='Pg329'/>
concerned all the evils involved in war happened. For this
philosopher's desire could not have been fulfilled without
much bloodshed. But God, who is the judge of His own
counsels, checked the fury of these antagonists without detriment
to the State by the removal of one of them. For when
Julian arrived among the Thracians, it was announced that
Constantius was dead. And thus did the Roman Empire
at that time escape the intestine strife. Julian entered Constantinople
and at once considered how he might conciliate
the masses and secure popular favor. Accordingly, he had
recourse to the following measures: he knew that Constantius
was hated by all the people who held the homoousian
faith and had driven them from the churches and had proscribed
and exiled their bishops. He was aware, also, that the
pagans were extremely discontented because they had been
forbidden to sacrifice to their gods, and were anxious to get
their temples opened and to be at liberty to offer sacrifices
to their idols. Thus he knew that both classes secretly entertained
hostile feelings toward his predecessor, and at the
same time the people in general were exceedingly exasperated
by the violence of the eunuchs, and especially by the rapacity
of Eusebius, the chief officer of the imperial bed-chamber.
Therefore he treated all with craftiness. With some he dissembled;
others he attached to himself by conferring obligations
upon them, led by a desire for vainglory; but to all he
manifested how he stood toward the heathen religion. And
first, in order to slander Constantius and condemn him as
cruel toward his subjects among the people generally, he recalled
the exiled bishops and restored to them their confiscated
estates. He next commanded suitable agents to open the
pagan temples without delay. Then he directed that those
who had been treated unjustly by the eunuchs should receive
back the property of which they had been plundered. Eusebius,
the chief officer of the imperial bed-chamber, he punished
with death, not only on account of the injuries he had inflicted
on others, but because he was assured that it was
<pb n='330'/><anchor id='Pg330'/>
through his machinations his brother Gallus had been killed.
The body of Constantius he honored with an imperial funeral,
but he expelled the eunuchs, the barbers, and cooks from the
palace.… At night, remaining awake, he wrote orations
which he afterward delivered in the Senate, going thither from
the palace, though in fact he was the first and only Emperor
since the time of Julius Cæsar who made speeches in that
assembly. He honored those who were eminent for literary
attainments, and especially those who taught philosophy;
in consequence of which an abundance of pretenders to learning
of this sort resorted to the palace from all quarters, men
who wore their palliums and were more conspicuous for their
costume than for their erudition. These impostors, who invariably
adopted the religious sentiments of their prince,
were inimical to the welfare of the Christians; but since
Julian himself was overcome by excessive vanity he derided
all his predecessors in a book which he wrote, entitled <q>The
Cæsars.</q> Led by the same haughty disposition, he composed
treatises against the Christians as well.

Julian recalled all who, during the reign of Constantius, had
been banished on account of their religious beliefs, and restored
to them their property which had been confiscated by law.
He charged the people not to commit any act of injustice
against any of the Christians, not to insult them and not to
constrain them to sacrifice unwillingly.… He deprived the
clergy, however, of their immunities, honors, and provisions
which Constantine had conferred, repealed the laws which
had been enacted in their favor, and reinforced their statutory
liabilities. He even compelled the virgins and widows,
who on account of their poverty were reckoned among the
clergy, to refund the provision which had been assigned them
from the public treasury.… In the intensity of his hatred
of the faith, he seized every opportunity to ruin the Church.
He deprived it of its property, votive offerings, and sacred
vessels, and condemned those who had demolished temples
during the reign of Constantine and Constantius to rebuild
them or to defray the expense of re-erection. On this ground,
since they were unable to repay the sum and also on account
of the search after sacred money, many of the priests, clergy,
and other Christians were cruelly tortured and cast into prison.…
He recalled the priests who had been banished by the
Emperor Constantius; but it is said that he issued this order in
their behalf, not out of mercy, but that through contention

To Arsacius, High Priest of Galatia. Hellenism<note place="foot">The

flourish as we would have it, because of its votaries. The
worship of the gods, however, is grand and magnificent beyond
all our prayers and hopes. Let our Adrastea be propitious
to these words. No one a little while ago could have
dared to look for such and so great a change in a short time.
But do we think that these things are enough, and not rather
consider that humanity shown strangers, the reverent diligence
shown in burying the dead, and the false holiness as
to their lives have principally advanced
atheism?<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>I.e.</hi>, Christianity.</note>
Each of these things is needful, I think, to be faithfully practised
among us. It is not sufficient that you alone should be such,
but in general all the priests, as many as there are throughout
Galatia, whom you must either shame or persuade to be
zealous, or else deprive them of their priestly office, if they
do not come with their wives, children, and servants to the
temples of the gods, or if they support servants, sons, or
wives who are impious toward the gods and prefer atheism to
piety. Then exhort the priests not to frequent the theatres,
not to drink in taverns, nor to practise any art or business
which is shameful or menial. Honor those who comply,
expel those who disobey. Establish hostelries in every city,
so that strangers, or whoever has need of money, may enjoy
our philanthropy, not merely those of our own, but also those
of other religions. I have meanwhile made plans by which
you will be able to meet the expense. I have commanded
that throughout the whole of Galatia annually thirty thousand
bushels of corn and sixty thousand measures of wine be given,
<pb n='333'/><anchor id='Pg333'/>
of which the fifth part I order to be devoted to the support
of the poor who attend upon the priests; and the rest is to be
distributed by us among strangers and beggars. For if there
is not one among the Jews who begs, and even the impious
Galileans, in addition to their own, support also ours, it is
shameful that our poor should be wanting our aid.

Measures taken by Julian for the restoration of heathenism.

<p>
The Emperor, who had long since been eager that Hellenism
should prevail through the Empire, was bitterly grieved seeing
it excelled by Christianity. The temples, however, were
kept open; the sacrifices and the ancient festivals appeared
to him in all the cities to come from his will. He grieved that
when he considered that if they should be deprived of his care
they would experience a speedy change. He was particularly
chagrined on discovering that the wives, children, and
servants of many pagan priests professed Christianity. On
reflecting that the Christian religion had a support in the life
and behavior of those professing it, he determined to introduce
into the pagan temples everywhere the order and discipline
of the Christian religion: by orders and degrees of the
ministry, by teachers and readers to give instruction in pagan
doctrines and exhortations, by appointed prayers on certain
days and at stated hours, by monasteries both for men and
for women who desired to live in philosophical retirement,
likewise hospitals for the relief of strangers and of the poor,
and by other philanthropy toward the poor to glorify the
Hellenic doctrine. He commanded that a suitable correction
be appointed by way of penance after the Christian tradition
for voluntary and involuntary transgressions. He is
said to have admired especially the letters of recommendation
of the bishops by which they commended travellers to other
bishops, so that coming from anywhere they might go to any
one and be hospitably received as known and as friends, and
be cared for kindly on the evidence of these testimonials.
<pb n='334'/><anchor id='Pg334'/>
Considering also these things, he endeavored to accustom the

I think true culture consists not in proficiency in words and
speech, but in a condition of mind which has sound intentions
and right opinions concerning good and evil, the honorable
and the base. Whoever, therefore, thinks one thing and
teaches those about him another appears to be as wanting in
culture as in honor. If in trifles there is a difference between
thought and speech, it is nevertheless an evil in some way
to be endured; but if in important matters any one thinks
one thing and teaches in opposition to what he thinks, this
is the trick of charlatans, the act not of good men, but of
<pb n='335'/><anchor id='Pg335'/>
those who are thoroughly depraved, especially in the case
of those who teach what they regard as most worthless, deceiving
and enticing by flattery into evil those whom they
wish to use for their own purposes. All those who undertake
to teach anything should be upright in life and not cherish
in their minds ideas which are in opposition to those commonly
received; most of all I think that such they ought to be who
converse with the young on learning, or who explain the writings
of the ancients, whether they are teachers of eloquence
or of rhetoric, and still more if they are sophists. For they
aim to be not merely teachers of words but of morals as well,
and claim instruction in political science as belonging to their
field. Whether this be true, I will leave undetermined. But
praising them as those who thus strive for fine professions,
I would praise them still more if they neither lied nor contradicted
themselves, thinking one thing and teaching their
pupils another. Homer, Hesiod, Demosthenes, Herodotus,
Thucydides, Isocrates, and Lysias were indebted to the gods
for all their science. Did they not think that they were
under the protection of Hermes and of the Muses? It seems
to me, therefore, absurd that those who explain their writings
should despise the gods they honored. But when I think it
is absurd, I do not say that, on account of their pupils, they
should alter their opinions; but I give them the choice, either
not to teach what they do not hold as good, or, if they prefer
to teach, first to convince their pupils that Homer, Hesiod,
or any of those whom they explain and condemn, is not so
godless and foolish in respect to the gods as they represent
him to be. For since they draw their support and make gain
from what these have written, they confess themselves most
sordidly greedy of gain, willing to do anything for a few
drachmas. Hitherto there were many causes for the lack of
attendance upon the temples, and overhanging fear gave an
excuse for keeping secret the right teaching concerning the
gods. Now, however, since the gods have granted us freedom,
it seems to me absurd that men should teach what they
<pb n='336'/><anchor id='Pg336'/>
do not regard as good. If they believe that all those men are
wise whose writings they expound and as whose prophets
they sit, let them first imitate their piety toward the gods;
but if they think that these writers erred concerning the most
honored gods, let them go into the churches of the Galileans
and expound Matthew and Luke, believing whom you forbid
attendance upon the sacrifices. I would that your ears
and tongues were born again, as you would say, of those things
in which I always take part, and whoever loves me thinks and
does. This law is to apply to teachers and instructors generally.
Whoever among the youth wishes to make use of
their instruction is not forbidden. For it would not be fair
in the case of those who are yet youths and do not know
which way to turn, to forbid the best way, and through fear
to compel them to remain unwillingly by their ancestral
institutions. Although it would be right to cure such people
against their wills as being insane, yet it is permitted all to
suffer under this disease. For it is my opinion that the ignorant
should be instructed, not punished.

<head>Chapter III. The Triumph Of The New Nicene Orthodoxy Over Heterodoxy And
Heathenism</head>

<p>
The Arian controversy was the most important series of
events in the internal history of the Christian Church in the
fourth century, without reference to the truth or error of the
positions taken or the rightful place of dogma within the
Church. It roused more difficulties, problems, and disputes,
led to more persecutions, ended in greater party triumphs
than any other ecclesiastical or religious movement. It
entered upon its last important phase about the time of the
accession of the Emperor Julian. From that time the parties
began to recognize their real affiliations and sought a
basis of union in a common principle. The effect was that
on the accession of Christian emperors the Church was able
to advance rapidly toward a definitive statement. Of the
<pb n='337'/><anchor id='Pg337'/>
emperors that followed Julian, Valentinian I (364-375), who
ruled in the West, took a moderate and tolerant position in
the question regarding the existence of heathenism alongside
of the Church and heretical parties within the Church, though
afterward harsher measures were taken by his son and successor
(<ref target="Section_69">§ 69</ref>). In the East his colleague Valens (364-378)
supported the extreme Arian party and persecuted the other
parties, at the same time tolerating heathenism. This only
brought the anti-Arians more closely together as a new party
on the basis of a new interpretation of the Nicene formula
(<ref target="Section_70">§ 70</ref>, <hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi>
<ref target="Section_66_c">§ 66, <hi rend='italic'>c</hi></ref>).
On the death of Valens at Adrianople,
378, an opportunity was given this new party, which it has
become customary to call the New Nicene party, to support
Theodosius (379-395) in his work of putting through the
orthodox formula at the Council of Constantinople, 381
(<ref target="Section_71">§ 71</ref>).

<head>§ 69. The Emperors from Jovian to Theodosius and
Their Policy toward Heathenism and Arianism</head>

<p>
The reign of Jovian lasted so short a time, June, 363, to
February, 364, that he had no time to develop a policy, and
the assertion of Theodoret that he extinguished the heathen
sacrificial fires is doubtful. On the death of Jovian, Valentinian
was elected Emperor, who soon associated with himself
his brother Valens as his colleague for the East. The
two were tolerant toward heathenism, but Valens took an
active part in favor of Arianism, while Valentinian held aloof
from doctrinal controversy. On the death of Valentinian I,
his sons Gratian (murdered at Lyons, 383) and Valentinian
II (murdered at Vienne by Arbogast, 392), succeeded to
<pb n='338'/><anchor id='Pg338'/>
the Empire. Under them the policy of toleration ceased,
heathenism was proscribed. In the East under Theodosius,
appointed colleague of Gratian in 379, the same policy was
enforced. Arianism was now put down with a strong hand
in both parts of the Empire.

Ammianus Marcellinus is probably the best of the later Roman historians,

353 to 378, in which period he is a source of the first rank, writing from
personal observation and first-hand information. Ammianus was himself
a heathen, but he seems not to have been embittered by the persecution
to which his faith had been subjected. He was a man of a
calm and judicial mind, and his judgment is rarely biassed, even when
he touches upon ecclesiastical matters which, however, he rarely does.

<p>
Valentinian was especially remarkable during his reign for
his moderation in this particular—that he kept a middle course
between the different sects of religion, and never troubled
any one, nor issued any orders in favor of one kind of worship
rather than another; nor did he promulgate any threatening
edicts to bow down the necks of his subjects to the form of
worship to which he himself was inclined; but he left these
parties just as he found them, without making any alterations.

far as to perform pagan rites, and thus the deceitful fire which
after Julian had been quenched by Jovian, was now rekindled
by permission of Valens. The rites of the Jews, of Dionysus

they would have been in a pious reign, but by revellers running

<pb n='340'/><anchor id='Pg340'/>
to restore the altar which had been removed. The following petition,
of which the more impressive parts are given, was made in 384, two
years after the first petition. The opening paragraph refers to the
former petition. The memorial is found among the Epistles of Ambrose,
who replies to it.
</quote>

<p>
1. As soon as the most honorable Senate, always devoted
to you, knew what crimes were made amenable to law, and
saw that the reputation of late times was being purified by
pious princes, following the example of a favorable time, it
gave utterance to its long-suppressed grief and bade me be
once again the delegate to utter its complaints. But through
wicked men audience was refused me by the divine Emperor,
otherwise justice would not have been wanting, my lords and
emperors of great renown, Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius,
victorious, triumphant, and ever august.
</p>

<p>
3. It is our task to watch on behalf of your clemency.
For by what is it more suitable that we defend the institutions
of our ancestors, and the rights and destiny of our country,
than by the glory of these times, which is all the greater when
you understand that you may not do anything contrary to
the custom of your ancestors? We request, then, the restoration
of that condition of religious affairs which was so long of
advantage to the State. Let the rulers of each sect and of
each opinion be counted up; a late one [Julian] practised the
ceremonies of his ancestors, a later [Valentinian I], did not
abolish them. If the religion of old times does not make a
precedent, let the connivance of the last [Valentinian and
Valens] do so.
</p>

<p>
4. Who is so friendly with the barbarians as not to require
an altar of Victory?…
</p>

<p>
5. But even if the avoidance of such an omen<note place="foot">As
the destruction of the altar of Victory.</note>
were not sufficient, it would at least have been seemly to abstain from
injuring the ornaments of the Senate House. Allow us, we
beseech you, as old men to leave to posterity what we received
as boys. The love of custom is great. Justly did the act of
<pb n='341'/><anchor id='Pg341'/>
the divine Constantius last for a short time. All precedents
ought to be avoided by you, which you know were soon
abolished.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>I.e.</hi>, by Julian and
Valentinian.</note>
</p>

<p>
6. Where shall we swear to obey your laws and commands?
By what religious sanctions shall the false mind be
terrified, so as not to lie in bearing witness? All things are,
indeed, filled with God, and no place is safe for the perjured,
but to be bound in the very presence of religious forms has
great power in producing a fear of sinning. That altar preserves
the concord of all; that altar appeals to the good faith
of each; and nothing gives more authority to our decrees than
that our order issues every decree as if we were under the
sanction of an oath. So that a place will be opened to perjury,
and my illustrious princes, who are defended by a public oath,
will deem this to be such.
</p>

<p>
7. But the divine Constantius is said to have done the
same. Let us rather imitate the other actions of that prince
[Valentinian I], who would have undertaken nothing of the
kind, if any one else had committed such an error before him.
For the fall of the earlier sets his successor right, and amendment
results from the censure of a previous example. It was
pardonable for your clemency's ancestor in so novel a matter
not to guard against blame. Can the same excuse avail us,
if we imitate what we know to have been disapproved?
</p>

<p>
8. Will your majesties listen to other actions of this same
prince, which you may more worthily imitate? He diminished
none of the privileges of the sacred virgins, he filled the
priestly offices with nobles. He did not refuse the cost of
the Roman ceremonies, and following the rejoicing Senate
through all the streets of the Eternal City, he beheld the
shrines with unmoved countenance, he read the names of the
gods inscribed on the pediments, he inquired about the origin
of the temples, and expressed admiration for their founders.
Although he himself followed another religion, he maintained
these for the Empire, for every one has his own customs,
<pb n='342'/><anchor id='Pg342'/>
every one his own rites. The divine Mind has distributed
different guardians and different cults to different cities. As
souls are separately given to infants as they are born, so to
a people is given the genius of its destiny. Here comes in
the proof from advantage, which most of all vouches to man
for the gods. For, since our reason is wholly clouded, whence
does the knowledge of the gods more rightly come to us, than
from the memory and records of successful affairs? Now if
a long period gives authority to religious customs, faith ought
to be kept with so many centuries, and our ancestors ought
to be followed by us as they happily followed theirs.
</p>

<p>
9. Let us now suppose that we are present at Rome and
that she addresses you in these words: <q>Excellent princes,
fathers of your country, respect my years to which pious
rites have brought me. Let me use the ancestral ceremonies,
for I do not repent of them. Let me live after my own fashion,
for I am free. This worship subdued the world to my
laws, these sacred rites repelled Hannibal from the walls,
and the Senones from the capitol. Have I been reserved for
this, that when aged I should be blamed? I will consider
what it is thought should be set in order, but tardy and discreditable
is the reformation of old age.</q>
</p>

<p>
10. We ask, therefore, peace for the gods of our fathers
and of our country. It is just that what all worship be considered
one. We look on the same stars, the sky is common,
the same world surrounds us. What difference does it make
by what paths each seeks the truth? We cannot attain to
so great a secret by one road; but this discussion is rather
for persons at ease; we offer now prayers, not conflict.<note place="foot">The
rest of the petition is taken up chiefly with a protest against the confiscation
of the endowments for the vestal virgins.</note>

her priests and vestal virgins, and that a general famine followed
upon the refusal of the priests' stipends.…
</p>

<p>
7. Let the invidious complaints of the Roman people
come to an end. Rome has given no such charge. She
speaks other words. <q>Why do you daily stain me with the
useless blood of the harmless herd? Trophies of victory depend
not upon the entrails of the flock, but on the strength
of those who fight. I subdued the world by a different discipline.
Camillus was my soldier who slew those who had
taken the Tarpeian rock, and brought back to the capitol the
standards taken away; valor laid low those whom religion
had not driven off.… Why do you bring forward the rites
of our ancestors? I hate the rites of Neros. Why should
I speak of emperors of two months,<note place="foot">Allusion

closely joined to their commencements. Or is it, perchance,
a new thing for barbarians to cross their boundaries? Were

the captive world,<note place="foot">Reference to the <q>thirty

victory were false? Was there then no altar of Victory?…</q>
</p>

<p>
8. By one road, says he, one cannot attain to so great a
secret. What you know not, that we know by the voice of
God. And what you seek by fancies we have found out from
<pb n='344'/><anchor id='Pg344'/>
the very wisdom and truth of God. Your ways, therefore,
do not agree with ours. You implore peace for your gods
from the Emperor, we ask peace for our emperors themselves
from Christ.…
</p>

<p>
10. But, says he, let the ancient altars be restored to their
images, and their ornaments to the shrines. Let this demand
be made of one who shares in their superstitions; a Christian
emperor has learned to honor the altar of Christ alone.…
Has any heathen emperor raised an altar to Christ? While
they demand the restoration of things which have been, by
their own example they show us how great reverence Christian
emperors ought to pay to the religion which they follow,
since heathen ones offered all to their superstitions.
</p>

<p>
We began long since, and now they follow those whom they
excluded. We glory in yielding our blood, an expense moves
them.… We have increased through loss, through want,
through punishment; they do not believe that their rites
can continue without contribution.
</p>

<p>
11. Let the vestal virgins, he says, retain their privileges.
Let those speak thus who are unable to believe that virginity
can exist without reward, let those who do not trust virtue,
encourage it by gain. But how many virgins have their promised
rewards gained for them? Hardly are seven vestal virgins
received. See the whole number whom the fillet and
chaplets for the head, the robes of purple dye, the pomp of
the litter surrounded by a company of attendants, the greatest
privileges, immense profits, and a prescribed time for virginity
have gathered together.
</p>

<p>
12. Let them lift up the eyes of soul and body, let them
look upon a people of modesty, a people of purity, an assembly
of virginity. Not fillets are the ornament of their heads,
but a veil common in use but ennobled by chastity; the enticement
of beauty not sought out, but laid aside; none of
those purple insignia, no delicious luxuries, but the practice
of fasts; no privileges, no gains; all other things, in fine, of
such a kind that one would think them restrained from desire
<pb n='345'/><anchor id='Pg345'/>
whilst practising their duties. But whilst the duty is being
practised the desire for it is aroused. Chastity is increased
by its own sacrifice. That is not virginity which is bought
with a price, and not kept through a desire for virtue; that
is not purity which is bought by auction for money or which
is bid for a time.
</p>

<p>
16. No one has denied gifts to shrines and legacies to
soothsayers; their land only has been taken away, because
they did not use religiously that which they claimed in right
of religion. Why did not they who allege our example practise
what we did? The Church has no possessions of her
own except the faith. Hence are her returns, her increase.
The possessions of the Church are the maintenance of the
poor. Let them count up how many captives the temples
have ransomed, what food they have contributed for the
poor, to what exiles they have supplied the means of living.
Their lands, then, have been taken away, but not their rights.
</p>

<p>
23. He says the rites of our ancestors ought to be retained.
But why, seeing that all things have made a progress toward
what is better?… The day shines not at the beginning,
but as time proceeds it is bright with increase of light and
grows warm with increase of heat.
</p>

<p>
27. We, too, inexperienced in age, have an infancy of our
senses, but, changing as years go by, lay aside the rudimentary
conditions of our faculties.
</p>

<p>
28. Let them say, then, that all things ought to have remained
in their first dark beginnings; that the world covered
with darkness is now displeasing because it has brightened
with the rising of the sun. And how much more pleasant
is it to have dispelled the darkness of the mind than that of
the body, and that the rays of faith should have shone than
that of the sun. So, then, the primeval state of the world, as
of all things, has passed away that the venerable old age of
hoary faith might follow.…
</p>

<p>
30. If the old rites pleased, why did Rome also take up
foreign ones? I pass over the ground hidden with costly
<pb n='346'/><anchor id='Pg346'/>
buildings, and shepherds' cottages glittering with degenerate
gold. Why, that I may reply to the very matter which they
complain of, have they eagerly received the images of captured
cities, and conquered gods, and the foreign rites of alien
superstition? Whence, then, is the pattern of Cybele washing
her chariots in a stream counterfeiting the Almo? Whence
were the Phrygian prophets and the deities of unjust Carthage,
always hateful to the Romans? And he whom the Africans
worship as Celestis, the Persians as Mithra, and the greater
number as Venus, according to a difference of name, not a
variety of deities?
</p>

<p>
31. They ask to have her altar erected in the Senate House
of the city of Rome, that is where the majority who meet
together are Christians! There are altars in all the temples,
and an altar also in the Temple of Victory. Since they delight
in numbers, they celebrate their sacrifices everywhere.
To claim a sacrifice on this one altar, what is it but to insult
the faith? Is it to be borne that a heathen should sacrifice
and a Christian be present?… Shall there not be a common
lot in that common assembly? The faithful portion of the
Senate will be bound by the voices of those who call upon the
gods, by the oaths of those who swear by them. If they
oppose they will seem to exhibit their falsehood, if they acquiesce,
to acknowledge what is a sacrilege.

<head>§ 70. The Dogmatic Parties and Their Mutual Relations</head>

<p>
The parties in the Arian controversy became greatly divided
in the course of the conflict. Speaking broadly, there were
still two groups, of which one was composed of all those who
regarded the Son as a creature and so not eternal and not
truly God; and the other, of those who regarded Him as uncreated
and in some real sense eternal and truly God, yet
without denying the unity of God. The former were the
various Arian parties tending to constant division. The latter
can hardly yet be comprised under one common name,
and might be called the anti-Arian parties, were it not that
there was a positive content to their faith which was in far
better harmony with the prevailing religious sentiment of
the East and was constantly receiving accessions. In the
second generation after Nicæa, a new group of theologians
came to the front, of whom the most important were Eustathius
of Sebaste, Cyril of Jerusalem, and the three Cappadocians,
Basil, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Gregory of Nyssa, most
of whom had at least sympathized with the Homoiousian
party. Already at the synod of Ancyra, in 358, an approach
was made toward a reconciliation of the anti-Arian factions,
in that, by a more careful definition, homoousios was rejected
only in the sense of identity of being, and homoiousios was
asserted only in the sense of equality of attributes in the not
identical subjects which, however, shared in the same essence.
Homoiousios did not mean mere similarity of being. (Anathemas
in Hahn, § 162; Hefele, § 80.) The line of development
ultimately taken was by a precise distinction between
<foreign lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">hypostasis</foreign> and
<foreign lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">ousia</foreign>, whereby
<foreign lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">hypostasis</foreign>, which never meant
person in the modern sense, which later is represented by the
<pb n='349'/><anchor id='Pg349'/>
Greek <foreign lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">prosopon</foreign>, was that
which subsists and shares with other
<foreign lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">hypostases</foreign>
in a common essence or <foreign lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">ousia</foreign>.

(MSG, 26:797.)</head>

<quote rend="display">
The Council of Alexandria, A. D. 362, was held by Athanasius in the
short time he was allowed to be in his see city at the beginning of the
reign of Julian. In the synodal letter or tome addressed to the Nicene
Christians at Antioch we have the foundation of the ultimate formula
of the Church as opposing Arianism, one substance and three persons,
one <foreign lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">ousia</foreign> and three
<foreign lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">hypostases</foreign>. The
occasion of the letter was an attempt
to win over the Meletian party in the schism among the anti-Arians
of Antioch. Meletius and his followers appear to have been
Homoiousians who were strongly inclined to accept the Nicene confession.
Their church was in the Old Town, a portion of Antioch. Opposed
to them was Paulinus with his party, which held firmly to the
Nicene confession. The difficulty in the way of a full recognition of
the Nicene statement by Meletius and his followers was that it savored
of Sabellianism. The difficulty of the party of Paulinus in recognizing
the orthodoxy of the Meletians was their practice of speaking of the
three hypostases or subsistences, which was condemned by the words
of the Nicene definition.<note place="foot">V. supra, <ref
target="Section_63">§ 63</ref>.</note> The outcome of the Alexandrian Council in
the matter was that a distinction could be made between <foreign
lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">ousia</foreign> and <foreign
lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">hypostasis</foreign>,
that the difference between the parties was largely a matter of
terminology, that those who could use the Nicene symbol with the understanding
that the Holy Ghost was not a creature and was not separate
from the essence of Christ should be regarded as orthodox. Out of
this understanding came the <q>New Nicene</q> party, of which the first
might be said to have been Meletius, who accepted <foreign
lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">homoousios</foreign> in the
sense of <foreign lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">homoiousios</foreign>,
and of which the <q>three great Cappadocians</q>
became the recognized leaders.

<quote rend="display">
The Council of Alexandria, in addition to condemning the Macedonian
heresy, in advance of Constantinople, also anticipated that assembly
by condemning Apollinarianism without mentioning the teacher
by whom the heresy was taught. It is condemned in the seventh section
of the tome.

<p>
§ 3. As many, then, as desire peace with us, and especially
those who assemble in the Old Town, and those again who
are seceding from the Arians, do ye call to yourselves, and
<pb n='350'/><anchor id='Pg350'/>
receive them as parents their sons, and as tutors and guardians
welcome them; and unite them to our beloved Paulinus and
his people, without requiring more from them than to anathematize
the Arian heresy and confess the faith confessed by the
holy Fathers at Nicæa and to anathematize also those who
say that the Holy Ghost is a creature and separate from the
essence of Christ. For this is in truth a complete renunciation
of the abominable heresy of the Arians, to refuse to divide
the Holy Trinity, or to say that any part of it is a creature.
</p>

<p>
§ 5. … As to those whom some were blaming for speaking
of three subsistences (hypostases), on the ground that the
phrase is unscriptural and therefore suspicious, we thought
it right, indeed, to require nothing beyond the confession of
Nicæa, but on account of the contention we made inquiry of
them, whether they meant, like the Arian madmen, subsistences
foreign and strange and alien in essence from one
another, and that each subsistence was divided apart by itself,
as is the case with other creatures in general and those
begotten of men, or like substances, such as gold, silver, or
brass; or whether, like other heretics, they meant three beginnings
and three Gods, by speaking of three subsistences.
</p>

<p>
They assured us in reply that they neither meant this nor
had ever held it. But upon our asking them <q>what, then,
do you mean by it, or why do you use such expressions?</q> they
replied: Because they believe in a Holy Trinity, not a trinity
in name only, but existing and subsisting in truth, both
Father truly existing and subsisting, and a Son, truly substantial
and subsisting, and a Holy Ghost subsisting and
really existing do we acknowledge, said they, and that neither
had they said there were three Gods or three beginnings,
nor would they at all tolerate such as said or held so, but that
they acknowledged a Holy Trinity, but one Godhead and one
beginning, and that the Son is co-essential with the Father,
as the Fathers said; and the Holy Ghost not a creature,
nor external, but proper to, and inseparable from, the essence
of the Father and the Son.
</p>

<pb n='351'/><anchor id='Pg351'/>

<p>
§ 6. Having accepted, then, these men's interpretation of
their language and their defence, we made inquiry of those
blamed by them for speaking of one subsistence, whether
they use the expression in the sense of Sabellius, to the negation
of the Son and Holy Ghost, or as though the Son was
non-substantial, or the Holy Ghost without subsistence. But
they in their turn assured us that they neither said this nor
had ever held it, but, <q>we use the word subsistence thinking it
the same thing to say subsistence or essence.</q><note place="foot">Hypostasis
or ousia; <hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> the Nicene definition,
<ref target="Section_63_g">§ 63, <hi rend='italic'>g</hi></ref>.</note>
But we hold there is One, because the Son is of the essence of the Father
and because of the identity of nature. For we believe that
there is one Godhead, and that the nature of it is one, and
not that there is one nature of the Father, from which that
of the Son and of the Holy Ghost are distinct. Well, thereupon,
they who had been blamed for saying that there were
three subsistences agreed with the others, while those who
had spoken of one essence, also confessed the doctrine of the
former as interpreted by them. And by both sides Arius
was anathematized as an adversary of Christ, and Sabellius,
and Paul of Samosata as impious men, and Valentinus and
Basilides as aliens from the truth, and Manichæus as an inventor
of mischief. And all, by God's grace, and after the
above explanations, agreed together that the faith confessed
by the Fathers at Nicæa is better and more accurate than the
said phrases, and that for the future they would prefer to be
content to use its language.
</p>

<p>
§ 7. But since, also, certain seemed to be contending together
concerning the fleshly economy of the Saviour, we
inquired of both parties. And what the one confessed the
others also agreed to: that not as when the word of the Lord
came to the prophets, did it dwell in a holy man at the consummation
of the ages, but that the Word himself was made
flesh; and being in the form of God, He took the form of a
servant, and from Mary after the flesh became man for us,
and that thus in Him the human race is perfectly and wholly
<pb n='352'/><anchor id='Pg352'/>
delivered from sin and made alive from the dead, and led
into the kingdom of heaven. For they also confess that the
Saviour had not a body without a soul, nor without sense or
intelligence;<note place="foot">The Apollinarian heresy.</note>
for it was not possible, when the Lord had become
man for us, that His body should be without intelligence;
nor was the salvation, effected in the Word himself,
a salvation of the body only, but of the soul also. And
being Son of God in truth, He became also Son of Man; and
being God's only begotten Son, He became also at the same
time <q>first-born among many brethren.</q> Wherefore neither
was there one Son of God before Abraham, another after
Abraham: nor was there one that raised up Lazarus, another
that asked concerning him; but the same it was that said as
man, <q>Where does Lazarus lie?</q> and as God raised him up;
the same that as man and in the body spat, but divinely
as Son of God opened the eyes of the man blind from his
birth; and while, as Peter says, in the flesh He suffered, as
God He opened the tomb and raised the dead. For which reasons,
thus understanding all that is said in the Gospel, they
assured us that they held the same truth about the Word's
incarnation and becoming man.

<head>§ 71. The Emperor Theodosius and the Triumph of the New Nicene Orthodoxy at
the Council of Constantinople, A. D. 381</head>

<p>
The Emperor Theodosius was appointed colleague of
Gratian and Valentinian II, 378. He issued in conjunction
with these emperors an edict (<hi rend='italic'>Cod. Theod.</hi>,
XVI, 1, 2; <hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> <hi rend='italic'>Cod.

<ref target="Section_72">§ 72</ref>,
<ref target="Section_72_b"><hi rend='italic'>b</hi></ref>,
<ref target="Section_72_e"><hi rend='italic'>e</hi></ref>), requiring all subjects
of the Empire to hold the orthodox faith in the Trinity. He
then called a council of Eastern bishops to meet at Constantinople
in 381 to settle the question as to the succession to
the see of that city and to confirm the creed of Nicæa as the
faith of the Eastern half of the Church. Gregory of Nazianzus
<pb n='353'/><anchor id='Pg353'/>
was appointed bishop of Constantinople, but was forced to
resign, having formerly been bishop of Sasima, from which
he had been translated in violation of the Nicene canons.
As soon as it was apparent that the bishops would have to
accept the Nicene faith the thirty-six Macedonians withdrew.
Their opinion as to the Holy Spirit, that He was not divine
in the same sense that the Son was divine, was condemned,
without express statement of the point condemned, as was
also the teaching of Apollinaris as to the nature of Christ.
The council was not intended to be an ecumenical or general
council, and it was not regarded as such even in the East
until after the Council of Chalcedon, A. D. 451, and then
probably on account of the creed which was then falsely
attributed to the Fathers of Constantinople. In the West
the council was not recognized as an ecumenical council until
well into the sixth century. (See Hefele, § 100.) The council
issued no creed and made no additions to the Nicene creed.
It published a tome, since lost, setting forth the faith in the
Trinity. It enacted four canons, of which only the first three
are of general application.

bishops only Pontic matters; and the Thracian bishops only
Thracian matters. And let not the bishops go beyond their
dioceses for ordination or any other ecclesiastical ministrations,

dioceses being observed, it is evident that the synod of each

<head>Chapter IV. The Empire And The Imperial State Church</head>

<p>
In the period extending from the accession of Constantine
(311 or 324) to the death of Theodosius the Great (395), the
characteristic features of the Church's organization took definite
form, and its relations to the secular authorities and the
social order of the Empire were defined. Its constitution with
its hierarchical organization of clergy, of courts, and synods,
together with its intimate union, at least in the East, with
the imperial authority, became fixed (<ref target="Section_72">§ 72</ref>).
As the Church of the Empire, it was under the control and patronage of the
State; all other forms of religion, whether pagan or Christian,
schismatical or heretical, were severely repressed (<ref target="Section_73">§ 73</ref>).
The Christian clergy, as officials in this State Church, became
a class by themselves in the society of the Empire, not only as
the recipients of privileges, but as having special functions
in the administration of justice, and eventually in the superintendence
of secular officials and secular business (<ref target="Section_74">§ 74</ref>).
By degrees the Christian spirit influenced the spirit of the
<pb n='357'/><anchor id='Pg357'/>
laws and the popular customs, though less than at first sight
might have been expected; the rigors of slavery were mitigated
and cruel gladiatorial sports abandoned (<ref target="Section_75">§ 75</ref>).
Meanwhile popular piety was by no means raised by the influx of
vast numbers of heathen into the Church; bringing with them
no little of their previous modes of thought and feeling, and
lacking the testing of faith and character furnished by the
persecutions, they lowered the general moral tone of the
Church, so that Christians everywhere were affected by these
alien ideas and feelings (<ref target="Section_76">§ 76</ref>).
The Church, however, endeavored to raise the moral tone and ideals and to work
effectively in society by care for the poor and other works
of benevolence, and in its regulation of marriage, which began
in this period to be a favorite subject of legislation for the
Church's councils (<ref target="Section_76">§ 76</ref>).
In monasticism this striving against the lowering forces in
Christian society and for a higher type of life most clearly
manifested itself, and, beginning in Egypt,
organized forms of asceticism spread throughout the East
and toward the end of the period to the West as well
(<ref target="Section_78">§ 78</ref>).
But monasticism was not confined to the private ascetic.
The priesthood, as necessarily presenting an example of higher
moral life, began to be touched by the ascetic spirit, and in
the West this took the form of enforced clerical celibacy,
though the custom of the East remained far less rigorous
(<ref target="Section_79">§ 79</ref>).
In presenting these lines of development, it is at
times convenient to pass beyond the exact bounds of the
period, so that the whole subject may be brought together
at this point of the history.

<head>§ 72. The Constitution of the State Church</head>

<p>
The Church's constitution received its permanent form in
this period. The conciliar system was carried to its logical
completion in the ecumenical council representing the entire
Church and standing at the head of a system which included
the provincial and patriarchal councils, at least in theory.
The clergy were organized into a hierarchy which rested upon
the basis of the single bishop in his diocese, who had under
him his clergy, and culminated in the patriarchs placed over
the great divisions of the State Church, corresponding to the
primary divisions of the Empire. The Emperor assumed the
supreme authority in the Church, and the foundation was laid
for what became under Justinian Cæsaropapism. By the
institution of the hierarchical gradation of authority and
jurisdiction, for the most part corresponding to the political
and administrative divisions of the Empire, the Church both
assumed a rigidly organized form and came more easily under
the control of the secular authority.

<head>(A) The Ecumenical Council</head>

<p>
The Council of Nicæa was held before there was any definition
of the place of an ecumenical council. Many councils
were held during the Arian controversy that were quite
as representative. It was taken for granted that the councils
were arranged in a scale of authority corresponding to the
extent of the Church represented. The first clear statement
of this principle is at the Council of Constantinople A. D. 382.

Jerusalem; Canons 15 and 16 place the bishops permanently in their
sees and the clergy under their own proper bishop.

<p>
Canon 4. It is by all means proper that a bishop should be
appointed by all the bishops in the province; but should this
be difficult, either on account of urgent necessity or because
of distance, three at least should assemble, and the suffrages
of the absent should also be given and communicated in
writing, and then the ordination should take place. But
in every province the ratification of what is done should be
left to the metropolitan.
</p>

<p>
Canon 5. Concerning those, whether of the clergy or of
the laity, who have been excommunicated in the several
provinces, let the provisions of the canon be observed by the
bishops which provides that persons cast out by some be not
readmitted by others.… Nevertheless, inquiry should be
made whether they have been excommunicated through captiousness,
or contentiousness, or any such like ungracious
disposition in the bishops. And that this matter may have
due investigation, it is decreed that in every province synods
shall be held twice a year, in order that when all the bishops
of the province are assembled together, such questions may
be thoroughly examined by them, that so those who have
confessedly offended against their bishop may be seen by
all to be for just causes excommunicated, until it shall appear
fit to a general meeting of the bishops to pronounce a milder
sentence upon them. And let these synods be held, the one
before Lent (that the pure gift may be offered to God after
<pb n='361'/><anchor id='Pg361'/>
all bitterness has been put away) and let the second be held
about autumn.

<p>
Canon 6. Let the ancient customs in Egypt, Libya, and
Pentapolis prevail, that the bishop of Alexandria shall have
jurisdiction in all these, since the like is customary for the
bishop of Rome also.<note place="foot">This sixth canon of Nicæa
very early received the title: <q>Concerning the Primacy of the
Roman Church.</q> and had this addition placed as its first clause:
<q>The Roman Church has always had the primacy.</q> In this form the canon
was cited by the Roman legates at the Council of Chalcedon in 451.</note>
Likewise in Antioch and the other
provinces, let the churches retain their privileges. And this
is to be universally understood, that if any one be made
bishop without the consent of his metropolitan, the great
synod has declared that such a man ought not to be bishop.
If, however, two or three bishops shall, from natural love of
contradiction, oppose the common suffrage of the rest, it
being reasonable and in accordance with the ecclesiastical
law, then let the choice of the majority prevail.
</p>

<p>
Canon 7. Since custom and ancient tradition have prevailed
that the bishop of Ælia [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, Jerusalem] should be
honored, let him, saving its due dignity to the metropolis,
have the next place of honor.
</p>

<p>
Canon 15. On account of the great disturbance and discords
that occur, it is decreed that the custom prevailing in
certain places contrary to the canon must wholly be done
away; so that neither bishop, presbyter, nor deacon shall
pass from city to city. And if any one, after this decree of
the holy and great synod, shall attempt any such thing or
continue in such course, his proceedings shall be utterly void,
and he shall be restored to the church for which he was ordained
bishop or presbyter.
</p>

<p>
Canon 16. Neither presbyters, nor deacons, nor any others
enrolled among the clergy, who, not having the fear of God
before their eyes, nor regarding the ecclesiastical canon, shall
recklessly remove from their own church, ought by any means
to be received by another church; but every constraint should
<pb n='362'/><anchor id='Pg362'/>
be applied to restore them to their own parishes;<note place="foot">Here,
as generally, parish means diocese.</note> and, if they
will not go, they must be excommunicated. And if one shall
dare surreptitiously to carry off and in his own church ordain
a man belonging to another, without the consent of his own
proper bishop from whom, although he was enrolled in the
clergy list, he has seceded, let the ordination be void.

be left for his restoration. And if another bishop shall receive
a man deposed for this cause, let him be punished by
the common synod as one who nullifies the ecclesiastical laws.

<p>
Canon 4. If any bishop be deposed by a synod, or any
presbyter or deacon, who has been deposed by his bishop,
shall presume to execute any part of the ministry, whether
it be a bishop according to his former function, or a presbyter,
or a deacon, he shall no longer have any prospect of restoration
in another synod, nor any opportunity of making his
defence; but they who communicate with him shall be cast
out of the Church, and particularly if they have presumed to
communicate with the persons aforementioned, knowing the
sentence pronounced against them.

<p>
Canon 6. If any one has been excommunicated by his own
bishop, let him not be received by others until he has either
been restored by his own bishop, or until, when a synod is

having convinced the synod, shall have received a different
sentence. And let this decree apply to the laity, and to the
presbyters and deacons, and all who are enrolled in the clergy

<p>
Canon 9. It behooves the bishops in each province to
acknowledge the bishop who presides in the metropolis, and
who has to take thought of the whole province; because all
men of business come together from every quarter to the
metropolis. Wherefore it is decreed that he have precedence
in rank, and that the other bishops do nothing extraordinary
without him, according to the ancient canon which prevailed
from the time of our fathers, or such things only as pertain
to their own particular parishes and the districts subject to
them. For each bishop has authority over his own parish,
both to manage it with piety, which is incumbent on every
one, and to make provision for the whole district which is
dependent upon his city; to ordain presbyters and deacons;
<pb n='364'/><anchor id='Pg364'/>

undertake anything further without the bishop of the metropolis;

Canon 10. The holy synod decrees that those [bishops]
living in village and country districts, or those who are called
chorepiscopi, even though they have received ordination to
the episcopate, shall regard their own limits and manage the
churches subject to them, and be content with the care and
administration of these; but they may ordain readers, subdeacons,
and exorcists, and shall be content with promoting
these; but they shall not presume to ordain either a presbyter
or a deacon, without the consent of the bishop of the city
to which he and his district are subject. And if he shall dare
to transgress these decrees, he shall be deposed from the rank
which he enjoys. And a chorepiscopus is to be appointed

The Council of Sardica was intended to be composed of representatives
from the entire Empire who might be able to settle once and for
all the Arian question. It met at Sardica on the boundary between
the two divisions of the Empire as they were then defined. The Eastern
ecclesiastics, strongly Arian, found themselves outnumbered by the
Western bishops who supported Athanasius and the Nicene definition
of faith. The Eastern representatives withdrew to Philippopolis near
by, and held their own council. The following canons were intended
to provide a system of appeal for cases like that of Athanasius, and
although they do not seem to have been acted upon enough to have
become a part of the Church's system, yet they were of great importance
inasmuch as subsequently they were used as late as the ninth
century for a support to a wholly different system of appeals. These
canons were very early attributed to the Council of Nicæa A. D. 325.

shall have gone against any bishop in a case, and he think

St. Peter the Apostle, and let those who have tried the case
write to Julius, the bishop of Rome, and if he shall decide

<head>§ 73. Sole Authority of the State Church</head>

<p>
When Theodosius had successfully forced upon the East
the theology of Nicæa, his policy as to religious matters was
manifest. No longer was heresy to be allowed. Laws were
to control opinion in the same way that they did conduct.
The old plea of the persecuted Christians under the heathen
Roman Empire, <hi rend='italic'>religio non cogi potest</hi>, was completely forgotten.
As Christianity was the one sole religion of divine character,
based upon the unique divine act of the incarnation,
it was folly to allow men to continue in heathenism—it might
<pb n='371'/><anchor id='Pg371'/>
even be dangerous to the State to allow them, as it might
bring down the just vengeance of God. With this policy the
populace was completely in accord, especially when it led
to the plunder and destruction of heathen sanctuaries, and
many of the more zealous of the clergy were willing to lead in
the assault. In these ways the State Church obtained a two-fold
exclusive authority: as regards heathenism, and as regards heresy.

The murder of Hypatia.

<quote rend="display">
The fearful murder of Hypatia represents another aspect of the
opposition to heathenism, in which the populace seconded the efforts
of the authorities in a policy of extirpating paganism.
</quote>

<p>
There was a woman in Alexandria named Hypatia. She
was the daughter of the philosopher Theon, and she had
attained such a proficiency in literature and science as to surpass
by far all the philosophers of her own time. Having
succeeded to the Platonic school, which had come down from
Plotinus, she explained all the principles of philosophy to
her auditors. Therefore many from all sides, wishing to study
philosophy, came to her. On account of the self-possession
and ease of manner which she had acquired by her study,
she not infrequently appeared with modesty in the presence
of magistrates. Neither did she feel abashed in entering an
assembly of men. For all men, on account of her extraordinary
dignity and virtue, admired her the more. Against her
envious hostility arose at that time. For as she had frequent
interviews with Orestes [governor of Alexandria] it
was calumniously reported among the Christian populace
that it was she who prevented Orestes from being reconciled
to the bishop [Cyril]. Some men of this opinion and of a hot-headed
disposition, whose leader was a reader named Peter,
waylaid her returning home. Dragging her from her carriage
they took her to the church called Cæsareum. There they
completely stripped her and murdered her with tiles. When
<pb n='374'/><anchor id='Pg374'/>
they had torn her in pieces, they took her mangled limbs to
a place called Cinaron, and there they burnt them. This
affair brought no little opprobrium, not only upon Cyril but
also upon the whole Alexandrian Church. And surely murders,
fights, and actions of that sort are altogether alien to
those who hold the things of Christ. These things happened
in the fourth year of the episcopate of Cyril [415].

Novatians and the Church at the beginning of the fifth century.

<quote rend="display">
Socrates is the principal authority for the later history of the Novatians.
It is probable that his interest in them and evident sympathy
for them were due to some connection with the sect, perhaps in his
early years, and he gives many incidents in their history, otherwise
unknown.

<p>
After Innocent [401-417], Zosimus [417-418] governed the
Roman Church for two years, and after him Boniface [418-422]
presided over it for three years. Celestinus [422-432]
succeeded him, and this Celestinus took away the churches
from the Novatians at Rome and obliged Rusticula, their
bishop, to hold his meetings secretly in private houses. Until
this time the Novatians had flourished exceedingly in Rome,
having many churches there and gathering large congregations.
But envy attacked them there, also, as soon as the
Roman episcopate, like that of Alexandria, extended itself
beyond the limits of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and degenerated
into its present state of secular domination. And for
this cause the bishops would not suffer even those who agreed
with them in matters of faith to enjoy the privileges of assembling
in peace, but stripping them of all they possessed,
praised them merely for these agreements in faith. The
bishops of Constantinople kept themselves free from this
sort of conduct; in so much as in addition to tolerating
them and permitting them to hold their assemblies within
the city, as I have already stated,<note place="foot">See Socrates,

since men of this sort have nothing in common with
others, neither in custom nor laws. And first we declare
that their crime is against the State, because what is committed
against the divine religion is held an injury of all.
And we will take vengeance upon them by the confiscation
of their goods, which, however, we command shall fall to
whomsoever is nearest of their kindred, in ascending or descending
lines or cognates of collateral branches to the second
degree, as the order is in succession to goods. Yet it shall
be so that we suffer the right to receive the goods to belong
to them, only if they themselves are not in the same way polluted
in their conscience. And it is our will that they be
deprived of every grant or succession from whatever title
derived. In addition, we do not leave to any one convicted
of this crime the right of giving, buying, selling, or finally
of making a contract. The prosecution shall continue till
death. For if in the case of the crime of treason it is lawful
to attack the memory of the deceased, not without desert
ought he to endure condemnation. Therefore let his last
will and testament be invalid, whether he leave property by
testament, codicil, epistle, or by any sort of will, if ever he
has been convicted of being a Manichæan, Phrygian, or Priscillianist,
and in this case the same order is to be followed as
in the grades above stated; and we do not permit sons to
succeed as heirs unless they forsake the paternal depravity;
for we grant forgiveness of the offence to those repenting.
We will that slaves be without harm if, rejecting their sacrilegious
master, they pass over to the Catholic Church by a

more faithful service. Property on which a congregation of
men of this sort assemble, in case the owner, although not a
participator in the crime, is aware of the meeting and does
not forbid it, is to be annexed to our patrimony; if the owner
is ignorant, let the agent or steward of the property, having
been punished with scourging, be sent to labor in the mines,
and the one who hires the property, if he be a person liable
to such sort of punishment, be deported. Let the rectors of
provinces, if by fraud or force they delay the punishment of
these crimes when they have been reported, or if conviction
have been obtained neglect punishment, know that they will
be subject to the fine of twenty pounds of gold. As for defensors
and heads of the various cities and the provincial officials,
a penalty of ten pounds is to compel them to do their duty,

checked them: those whom we could reform we have corrected
and driven to condemn Manichæus with his preachings

those who have acknowledged their fault from the pit of their

some who had so deeply involved themselves that no remedy

1. And so under the first head is shown what impious
views they hold about the divine Trinity; they affirm that
the person of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost is one
and the same, as if the same God were named now Father, now
Son, now Holy Ghost; and as if He who begat were not one,
He who was begotten another, and He who proceedeth
from both yet another; but an undivided unity must be
understood, spoken of under three names, but not consisting
of three persons.…
</p>

<p>
2. Under the second head is displayed their foolish and
empty fancy about the issue of certain virtues from God
which He began to possess, and which were posterior to God
in His own essence.…
</p>

<p>
3. Again the language of the third head shows that these
same impious persons assert that the Son of God is called
<q>only begotten</q> for this reason that He alone was born of
a virgin.…
</p>

<p>
4. The fourth head deals with the fact that the birthday
of Christ, which the Catholic Church venerates as His taking
on Him the true man, because <q>the Word became flesh
and dwelt among us,</q> is not truly honored by these men, but
they pretend that they honor it, for they fast on that day,
as they do also on the Lord's Day, which is the day of Christ's
<pb n='379'/><anchor id='Pg379'/>
resurrection. No doubt they do this because they do not
believe that Christ the Lord was truly born in man's nature,
but maintain that by a sort of illusion there was an appearance
of what was not a reality.
</p>

<p>
5. Their fifth head refers to their assertion that man's
soul is a part of the divine substance, and that the nature of
our human state does not differ from its Creator's nature.…
</p>

<p>
6. The sixth points out that they say that the devil never
was good and that his nature is not God's handiwork, but
that he came forth of chaos and darkness.…

7. In the seventh place follows that they condemn marriage
and are horrified at begetting children, in which, as in
nearly all things, they agree with the profanity of the Manichæans.
</p>

<p>
8. Their eighth point is that the formation of men's bodies
is the device of the devil and that the seed of conception is
shaped by the aid of demons in the womb.…
</p>

<p>
9. The ninth notice declares that they say that the sons
of promise are born, indeed, of women, conceived by the Holy
Spirit; lest the offspring that is born of carnal seed should
seem to share in God's estate.…
</p>

<p>
10. Under the tenth head they are reported as asserting
that the souls which are placed in men's bodies have previously
been without a body and have sinned in their heavenly habitation
and for this reason have fallen from their high estate
to a lower one alighting upon ruling spirits of divers qualities,
and after passing through a succession of powers of the air
and stars, some fiercer, some milder, are enclosed in bodies
of different sorts and conditions, so that whatever variety and
inequality is meted out to us in this life, seems the result of
previous causes.…

<p>
11. Their eleventh blasphemy is that in which they suppose
that both the souls and bodies of men are under the
influence of fatal stars.…
</p>

<p>
12. The twelfth of these points is this: that they map out
the parts of the soul under certain powers and the limbs under

others; and they suggest the characters of the inner powers
that rule the soul by giving them the names of the patriarchs;

<p>
The elevation of the Church exposed the Church to worldliness
whereby selfish men, or men carried away with partisan
zeal, took advantages of its privileges or contended
fiercely for important appointments. The clergy all too frequently
ingratiated themselves with wealthy members of
their flocks that they might receive from them valuable
legacies, an abuse which had to be corrected by civil law;
factional spirit occasionally led to bloodshed in episcopal
elections. But on the other hand the Church was employed
by the State in an important work which properly belonged
to the secular administration, viz., the administration of justice
in the episcopal courts of arbitration, for which see <hi rend='italic'>Cod.

<quote rend="display">
The strife which attained shocking proportions in connection with
the election of Damasus seems to have been connected with the schism
at Rome occasioned by the attitude of Liberius in the Arian controversy.
Damasus proved one of the ablest bishops that Rome ever
had in the ancient Church. For aid in overcoming the partisans of
Ursinus a Roman council appealed to the Emperor Gratian, whose
answer is given in part above, <ref target="Section_72_e">§ 72,

<p>
12. Damasus and Ursinus, being both immoderately eager
to obtain the bishopric, formed parties and carried on the
<pb n='381'/><anchor id='Pg381'/>
conflict with great asperity, the partisans of each carrying
their violence to actual battle, in which men were wounded
and killed. And as Juventius, prefect of the city, was unable
to put an end to it, or even to soften these disorders, he
was at last by their violence compelled to withdraw to the
suburbs.
</p>

<p>
13. Ultimately Damasus got the best of the strife by the
strenuous efforts of his partisans. It is certain that on one
day one hundred and thirty-seven dead bodies were found in
the Basilica of Sicinus, which is a Christian church. And
the populace who had thus been roused to a state of ferocity
were with great difficulty restored to order.
</p>

<p>
14. I do not deny, when I consider the ostentation that
reigns at Rome, that those who desire such rank and power
may be justified in laboring with all possible exertion and
vehemence to obtain their wishes; since after they have succeeded,
they will be secure for the future, being enriched by
offerings of matrons, riding in carriages, dressing splendidly,
and feasting luxuriously, so that their entertainments surpass
even royal banquets.
</p>

<p>
15. And they might be really happy if, despising the vastness
of the city which they excite against themselves by their
vices, they were to live in imitation of some of the priests in
the provinces, whom the most rigid abstinence in eating and
drinking, and plainness of apparel, and eyes always cast on
the ground, recommend to the everlasting Deity and His true
worshippers as pure and sober-minded men.

<head>§ 75. Social Significance of the State Church</head>

<p>
The Church at no time degenerated into a mere department
of the State. In spite of the worldly passions that invaded
it and the dissensions that distracted it, the Church remained
mindful of its duty as not merely a guardian of the deposit of
faith but as a school of Christian morality. This was the
principle of the penitential discipline of the ante-Nicene period.
It was saved from becoming a mere form, or lost altogether by
the custom which became general after 400, of having the
confession of sin made in private. In matters of great moral
concern, such as the treatment of slaves, marriage, and divorce,
and the cruel sports of the arena, the Church was able
to exert its influence and eventually bring about a change in
the law. And in standing for righteousness, instances were
not lacking when the highest were rebuked by the Church,
as in the great case of Ambrose and Theodosius.

has been without warrant committed by some; namely,
concerning penance, which is demanded of the faithful, that
a written confession in a schedule concerning the nature of
each particular sin be not recited publicly, since it suffices
that the guilt of conscience be made known by a secret confession
to the priests alone. Although that fulness of faith
appears to be laudable which on account of the fear of God
is not afraid to blush before men, yet because the sins of all
are not such that those who demand penance would not be
afraid to publish them, let a custom so objectionable be done
away; that many may not be deterred from the remedies
of penitence, since they are ashamed or are afraid to disclose
their deed to their enemies, by which they might be ruined
by the requirements of the laws. For that confession suffices
which is first offered to God, then further to the priest, who
intervenes as with intercessions for the sins of the penitent.
In this way many can be brought to penitence if the bad conscience
of the one making the confession is not published in
the ears of the people.

otherwise the sale or transaction made shall not
have validity. If the bishop bestows upon any deserving
slaves of the Church their liberty, let the liberty that has been

your kingdom, for you will put it away by humbling your soul
before God. You are a man, temptation has come to you;
conquer it. Sin is not done away but by tears and penitence.
Neither angel can do it, nor archangel. The Lord himself,

not forgive any but those who do penance.

you who were an example of unheard-of piety, who were conspicuous
for clemency, who would not suffer single offenders
to be put in peril, should not mourn that so many innocent
persons have perished. Though you have waged war most
successfully, though in other matters too you are worthy of
praise, yet piety was ever the crown of your actions. The
devil envied that which you had as a most excellent possession.
Conquer him whilst you still possess that wherewith
you can conquer. Do not add another sin to your sin by a

allowed after the shedding of the blood of many? I

The later Roman law of divorce.
</quote>

<quote rend="display">
The Roman law under the Empire was extremely favorable to divorce,
making it easy for either party to become rid of the other for
any cause that seemed sufficient. The Christian Church from the
first, following the teaching of Christ, opposed divorce. Marriage
was an indissoluble relation; see § 39
<ref target="Section_39_f"><hi rend='italic'>f</hi></ref>,
<ref target="Section_39_g"><hi rend='italic'>g</hi></ref>. It was only by degrees that
much change could be introduced into the civil law. The following
law of Theodosius II gives the condition of the law in the fifth century.
It shows that to some extent the Christian principles regarding marriage
had affected legislation.
</quote>

<p>
If a woman leave her husband by a repudiation made by
her and prove no cause for her divorcing him, the gifts which
she received as bride shall be taken away and she shall likewise
be deprived of her dowry, and be subjected to the punishment
<pb n='392'/><anchor id='Pg392'/>
of deportation; and to her we deny not only the right
of marriage with another man, but also the right of
post-liminium.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>I.e.</hi>,
of returning to her former home and condition.</note>
But if the woman opposed to the marriage prove
faults of morals and vices, though of no great gravity, let
her lose her dowry and pay back to her husband her marriage
gift, and let her never join herself in marriage with another;
that she may not stain her widowhood with the impudence
of unchastity we give the repudiated husband the right of
bringing an accusation by law. Hereafter if she who abandons
her husband prove grave causes and a guilt involving great
crimes, let her obtain a control of her dowry and marriage
gifts, and five years after the day of repudiation she shall
receive the right of remarrying; for it would then appear that
she had acted rather out of detestation of her husband than
from desire after another. Likewise, if the husband bring
a divorce and charge grave crimes against the woman, let
him bring action against the accused under the laws and let
him both have the dowry (sentence having been obtained)
and let him receive his gifts to her and let the free choice of
marrying another be granted him immediately. But if it
is an offence of manners and not of a criminal nature, let him
receive the donations, relinquish the dowry, and marry after
two years. But if he merely wishes to dissolve the marriage
by dissent, and she who is put away is charged with no fault
or sin, let the man lose the donation and the dowry, and in
perpetual celibacy let him bear as a penalty for his wrongful
divorce the pain of solitude; to the woman, however, is conceded
after a year the right to remarry. Regarding the retention
of the dowry on account of the children we command
that the directions of the old law shall be observed.

<head>§ 76. Popular Piety and the Reception of Heathenism
in the Church</head>

<p>
When vast numbers poured into the Church in the fourth
century and the profession of Christianity no longer involved
danger, morals became less austere, and the type of piety became
adapted to the religious condition of those with whom
the Church had now to deal. This is shown in the new place
that the intercession of saints and the veneration of their
relics take in the religious life of the times. Yet these and
similar forms of devotion in popular piety were not new and
cannot be attributed in principle to any wholesale importation
of heathenism into the Church, as was charged at the
time and often since. In principle, and to some extent in
practice, they can be traced to times of persecution and danger.
But, on the other hand, no little heathenism was brought
into the Church by those who came into it without any adequate
preparation or real change of religious feeling. With
this heathenism the Church had to struggle, either casting it
<pb n='397'/><anchor id='Pg397'/>
out in whole or in part, or rendering it as innocuous as possible.
In spite of all, many heathen superstitions remained everywhere
in Christendom, though playing for the most part
such an inferior rôle as to be negligible in the total effect.

When Simon's mother-in-law was lying sick with violent

So Peter and Andrew prayed for the widow. Would that
there were some one who could so quickly pray for us, or
better still, they who prayed for the mother-in-law—Peter
and Andrew his brother. Then they could pray for one related
to them, now they are able to pray for us and for all.
For you see that one bound by great sin is less fit to pray for
herself, certainly less likely to obtain for herself. Let her
then make use of others to pray for her to the Physician. For
the sick, unless the Physician be called to them by the prayers
of others, cannot pray for themselves. The flesh is weak,
the soul is sick and hindered by the chains of sins, and cannot
direct its feeble steps to the throne of that great Physician.
The angels must be entreated for us, who have been to us as
guardians; the martyrs must be entreated whose patronage
we seem to claim by a sort of pledge, the possession of their
body. They can entreat for our sins, who, if they had any
sins, washed them in their own blood; for they are the martyrs

A defence of the worship and practice of the Church, especially in
regard to veneration of relics against the criticism of Vigilantius.
</quote>

<quote rend="display">
Jerome's attack on Vigilantius is in many respects a masterpiece of
scurrility, and unworthy of the ability of the man. But it is invaluable
as a statement of the opinions of the times regarding such matters
as the veneration of relics, the attitude toward the departed saints
and martyrs, and many other elements of the popular religion which
have been commonly attributed to a much later period.
</quote>

<p>
Ch. 4. Among other words of blasphemy he [Vigilantius]
may be heard to say: <q>What need is there for you not only to
reverence with so great honor but even to adore I know not
what, which you carry about in a little vessel and worship?</q>
And again in the same book, <q>Why do you adore by kissing a
bit of powder wrapped up in a cloth?</q> and further on, <q>Under
the cloak of religion we see really a heathen ceremony introduced
into the churches; while the sun is shining heaps of
tapers are lighted, and everywhere I know not what paltry
bit of powder wrapped in a costly cloth is kissed and worshipped.
Great honor do men of this sort pay to the blessed
martyrs, who, as they think, are to be glorified by trumpery
tapers, but to whom the Lamb who is in the midst of the
throne, with all the brightness of His majesty gives light.</q>
</p>

<p>
Ch. 5. … Is the Emperor Arcadius guilty of sacrilege,
who, after so long a time, conveyed the bones of the blessed
Samuel from Judæa to Thrace? Are all the bishops to be considered
not only sacrilegious but silly as well, who carried that
most worthless thing, dust and ashes, wrapped in silk and in
a golden vessel? Are the people of all the churches fools, who
went to meet the sacred relics, and received them with as
much joy as if they beheld the living prophet in the midst
of them, so that there was one great swarm of people from
Palestine to Chalcedon and with one voice the praises of
Christ resounded?…
</p>

<p>
Ch. 6. For you say that the souls of the Apostles and
martyrs have their abode either in the bosom of Abraham,
or in some place of refreshment, or under the altar of God,
and that they cannot leave their own tombs and be present
<pb n='399'/><anchor id='Pg399'/>
where they will. They are, it seems, of senatorial rank and
are not in the worst sort of prison and among murderers, but
are kept apart in liberal and honorable custody in the isles of
the blessed and the Elysian fields. Do you lay down laws for
God? Will you throw the Apostles in chains? So that to the
day of judgment they are to be kept in confinement and are
not with the Lord, although it is written concerning them,
<q>They follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth.</q> If the Lamb
is present everywhere, then they who are with the Lamb, it
must be believed, are everywhere. And while the devil and
the demons wander through the whole world, and with only
too great speed are present everywhere, the martyrs after shedding
their blood are to be kept out of sight shut up in a
coffin<note place="foot"><q>Shut up in the altar</q> is another reading.</note>
from whence they cannot go forth? You say in your
pamphlet that so long as we are alive we can pray for one
another; but after we are dead the prayer of no person for
another can be heard, and especially because the martyrs,
though they cry for the avenging of their blood, have never
been able to obtain their request. If Apostles and martyrs,
while still in the body, can pray for others, when they ought
still to be anxious for themselves, how much more must they
do so after they have their crowns and victories and triumphs?
A single man, Moses, won pardon from God for six hundred
thousand armed men; and Stephen, the follower of his Lord
and the first martyr for Christ, entreats pardon for his persecutors;
and after they have entered on their life with Christ,
shall they have less power? The Apostle Paul says that
two hundred and seventy-six souls were given him in the ship;
and after his dissolution, when he began to be with Christ,
must he then shut up his mouth and be unable to say a word
for those who throughout the whole world have believed in
his Gospel? Shall Vigilantius the live dog be better than Paul
the dead lion?

when, in the peace which came after such numerous and violent
persecutions, crowds of heathen who wished to assume
the Christian religion were kept back because, having been
accustomed to celebrate the feasts connected with idols in
revelling and drunkenness, they could not easily refrain from
these pleasures so hurtful and so habitual; and it seemed good
to our ancestors that for a time a concession should be made
to this infirmity, that after they had renounced the former
festivals they might celebrate other feasts, in honor of the
holy martyrs, which were observed, not with the same profane
design, although with similar indulgence. Now upon
them as persons bound together in the name of Christ, and
submissive to the yoke of His august authority, the wholesome
restraints of sobriety were laid; and these restraints, on
account of the honor and fear of Him who appointed them
they might not resist; and that therefore it was now time
that those who did not dare to deny that they were Christians
should begin to live according to Christ's will; being now
Christians they should reject those things conceded that they
might become Christians.

<head>§ 77. The Extension of Monasticism Throughout the Empire</head>

<p>
Asceticism arose within the Christian Church partly as the
practical expression of the conviction of the worthlessness of
things transitory and partly as a reaction against the moral
laxity of the times. As this laxity could not be kept entirely
<pb n='402'/><anchor id='Pg402'/>
out of the Church, and Christians everywhere were exposed
to it, those who sought the higher life felt the necessity of
retirement. From the life of the isolated hermit, asceticism
advanced naturally to the community type of the ascetic
life. There were forerunners in non-Christian religions of
the solitary ascetic and the cenobite in Egypt, Palestine,
India, and elsewhere, but all the essentials of Christian monasticism
can be adequately explained without employing the
theory of borrowing or imitation. For the principal points
of development, <hi rend='italic'>v.</hi> §§ <ref target="Section_53">53</ref>,
<ref target="Section_78">78</ref>, <ref target="Section_104">104</ref>.
When monasticism had once made itself a strong factor in the Christian religious
life of Egypt, it was quickly taken up by other parts of
the Church as it satisfied a widely felt want. In Asia Minor
Basil of Cæsarea was the great promoter and organizer of the
ascetic life; and his rule still obtains throughout the East.
In the West Athanasius appears to have introduced monastic
ideas during his early exiles. Ambrose was a patron of
the movement. Martin of Tours, Severinus, and John Cassian
did much to extend it in Gaul. Augustine organized
his clergy according to a monastic rule which ultimately
played a large part in later monasticism.

The Rule of Pachomius.
</quote>

<quote rend="display">
Palladius, the author of the history of monasticism, known as the
<hi rend='italic'>Historia Lausiaca</hi>, was an Origenist,
pupil of Evagrius Ponticus, and later bishop in Asia
Minor. He is not to be confused with Palladius
of Helenopolis, who lived about the same time, in the first part of the
fifth century. The work of Palladius receives its name from the fact
that it is dedicated to a high official, Lausus by name. Palladius made
a careful study of monasticism, travelling extensively in making researches
for his work. He also used what written material was available.
It is probable that the text is largely interpolated, but on the
whole it is a trustworthy account of the early monasticism. It was
written about A. D. 420, and the following account of Pachomius
should be compared with that of Sozomenus, <hi rend='italic'>Hist.
Ec.</hi>, III, 14, written some years later. Text in Kirch, nn.

</quote>

<p>
There is a place in the Thebaid called Tabenna, in which
lived a certain monk Pachomius, one of those men who have
<pb n='403'/><anchor id='Pg403'/>
attained the highest form of life, so that he was granted predictions
of the future and angelic visions. He was a great
lover of the poor, and had great love to men. When, therefore,
he was sitting in a cave an angel of the Lord came in and
appeared to him and said: Pachomius you have done well
those things which pertain to your own affairs; therefore sit
no longer idle in this cave. Up, therefore, go forth and gather
all the younger monks and dwell with them and give them
laws according to the form which I give thee. And he gave
him a brass tablet on which the following things were written:
</p>

<p>
1. Give to each to eat and drink according to his strength;
and give labors according to the powers of those eating, and
forbid neither fasting nor eating. Thus appoint difficult
labors to the stronger and those who eat, but the lighter and
easy tasks to those who discipline themselves more and are
weaker.
</p>

<p>
2. Make separate cells in the same place; and let three
remain in a cell. But let the food of all be prepared in one
house.
</p>

<p>
3. They may not sleep lying down, but having made seats
built inclining backward let them place their bedding on
them and sleep seated.
</p>

<p>
4. But by night let them wear linen tunics, being girded
about. Let each of them have a shaggy goatskin, made
white. Without this let them neither eat nor sleep. When
they go in unto the communion of the mysteries of Christ
every Sabbath and Lord's Day, let them loose their girdles
and put off the goatskin, and enter with only their cuculla
[<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> DCA]. But he made the cuculla for them without any
fleece, as for boys; and he commanded to place upon them
certain branding marks of a purple cross.
</p>

<p>
5. He commanded that there be twenty-four groups of the
brethren, according to the number of the twenty-four letters.
And he prescribed that to each group should be given as a
name a letter of the Greek alphabet, from Alpha and Beta,
one after another, to Omega, in order that when the archimandrite
<pb n='404'/><anchor id='Pg404'/>
asked for any one in so great a company, that one
may be asked who is the second in each, how group Alpha is,
or how the group Beta; again let him salute the group Rho;
the name of the letters following its own proper sign. And
upon the simpler and more guileless place the name Iota;
and upon those who are more ill-tempered and less righteous
the letter Xi. And thus in harmony with the principles and
the life and manners of them arrange the names of the letters,
only the spiritual understanding the meaning.
</p>

<p>
6. There was written on the tablet that if there come a
stranger of another monastery, having a different form of
life, he shall not eat nor drink with them, nor go in with them
into the monastery, unless he shall be found in the way outside
of the monastery.
</p>

<p>
7. But do not receive for three years into the contest of
proficients him who has entered once for all to remain with
them; but when he has performed the more difficult tasks,
then let him after a period of three years enter the stadium.
</p>

<p>
8. When they eat let them veil their faces, that one brother
may not see another brother eating. They are not to speak
while they eat; nor outside of their dish or off the table shall
they turn their eyes toward anything else.
</p>

<p>
9. And he made it a rule that during the whole day they
should offer twelve prayers; and at the time of lighting the
lamps, twelve; and in the course of the night, twelve; and
at the ninth hour, three; but when it seemed good for the whole
company to eat, he directed that each group should first sing
a psalm at each prayer.
</p>

<p>
But when the great Pachomius replied to the angel that the
prayers were few, the angel said to him: I have appointed
these that the little ones may advance and fulfil the law and
not be distressed; but the perfect do not need to have laws
given to them. For being by themselves in their cells, they
have dedicated their entire life to contemplation on God.
But to these, as many as do not have an intelligent mind, I
will give a law that as saucy servants out of fear for the
<pb n='405'/><anchor id='Pg405'/>
Master they may fulfil the whole order of life and direct it
properly. When the angel had given these directions and
fulfilled his ministry he departed from the great Pachomius.
There are monasteries observing this rule, composed of seven
thousand men, but the first and great monastery, wherein the
blessed Pachomius dwelt, and which gave birth to the other
places of asceticism, has one thousand three hundred men.

tractata</hi>, Questio 7. (MSG, 31:927.)</head>

<quote rend="display">
The Rule of St. Basil is composed in the form of question and answer,
and in place of setting down a simple, clearly stated law, with perhaps
some little exhortation, goes into much detailed argument, even in
the briefer Rule. In the following passage Basil points out the advantages
of the cenobitic life over the solitary or hermit life. It is
condensed as indicated.
</quote>

<p>
Questio VII. Since your words have given us full assurance
that the life [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the cenobitic life] is dangerous with
those who despise the commandments of the Lord, we wish
accordingly to learn whether it is necessary that he who withdraws
should remain alone or live with brothers of like mind
who have placed before themselves the same goal of piety.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Responsio</hi> 1. I think that the life of several in the same
place is much more profitable. First, because for bodily
wants no one of us is sufficient for himself, but we need each
other in providing what is necessary. For just as the foot
has one ability, but is wanting another, and without the help
of the other members it would find neither its own power
strong nor sufficient of itself to continue, nor any supply for
what it lacks, so it is in the case of the solitary life: what is
of use to us and what is wanting we cannot provide for ourselves,
for God who created the world has so ordered all things
that we are dependent upon each other, as it is written that
we may join ourselves to one another [<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Wis. 13:20]. But
in addition to this, reverence to the love of Christ does not
permit each one to have regard only to his own affairs, for
love, he says, seeks not her own [I Cor. 13:5]. The solitary
<pb n='406'/><anchor id='Pg406'/>
life has only one goal, the service of its own interests. That
clearly is opposed to the law of love, which the Apostle fulfilled,
when he did not in his eyes seek his own advantage
but the advantage of many, that they might be saved [<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> I
Cor. 10:33]. Further, no one in solitude recognizes his own
defects, since he has no one to correct him and in gentleness
and mercy direct him on his way. For even if correction
is from an enemy, it may often in the case of those who are
well disposed rouse the desire for healing; but the healing of
sin by him who sincerely loves is wisely accomplished.…
Also the commands may be better fulfilled by a larger community,
but not by one alone; for while this thing is being
done another will be neglected; for example, by attendance
upon the sick the reception of strangers is neglected; and
in the bestowal and distribution of the necessities of life
(especially when in these services much time is consumed)
the care of the work is neglected, so that by this the greatest
commandment and the one most helpful to salvation is neglected;
neither the hungry are fed nor the naked clothed.
Who would therefore value higher the idle, useless life than the
fruitful which fulfils the commandments of God?
</p>

<p>
3. … Also in the preservation of the gifts bestowed by
God the cenobitic life is preferable.… For him who falls
into sin, the recovery of the right path is so much easier, for
he is ashamed at the blame expressed by so many in common,
so that it happens to him as it is written: It is enough that
the same therefore be punished by many [II Cor. 2:6].…
There are still other dangers which we say accompany the
solitary life, the first and greatest is that of self-satisfaction.
For he who has no one to test his work easily believes that he
has completely fulfilled the commandments.…
</p>

<p>
4. For how shall he manifest his humility, when he has no
one to whom he can show himself the inferior? How shall he
manifest compassion, cut off from the society of many? How
will he exercise himself in patience, if no one opposes his
wishes?

Asceticism of the solitary life was apart from the organization of

Athanasius, who was a patron of the monastic life and often

of the two religious forces ultimately became embodied in the principle
of monastic exemption. The Council of Chalcedon, in 451, aimed to
correct the early abuse by placing the monasteries under the control
of the bishop.

<p>
Upon a certain day … there came to the house to see
Alypius and me, Pontitianus, a countryman of ours, in so
far as he was an African, who held high office in the Emperor's
court. What he wanted with us I know not. We sat down
to talk together, and upon the table before us, used for games,
he noticed by chance a book; he took it up, opened it, and,
contrary to his expectations, found it to be the Apostle Paul,
for he imagined it to be one of those books the teaching of
which was wearing me out. At this he looked up at me
smilingly, and expressed his delight and wonder that he so
unexpectedly found this book, and this only, before my eyes.
For he was both a Christian and baptized, and in constant and
<pb n='409'/><anchor id='Pg409'/>
daily prayers he often prostrated himself before Thee our
God in the Church. When, then, I had told him that I bestowed
much pains upon these writings, a conversation ensued
on his speaking of Anthony, the Egyptian monk, whose
name was in high repute among Thy servants, though up to
that time unfamiliar to us. When he came to know this he
lingered on that topic, imparting to us who were ignorant a
knowledge of this man so eminent, and marvelling at our ignorance.
But we were amazed, hearing Thy wonderful works
most fully manifested in times so recent, and almost in our
own, wrought in the true faith and the Catholic Church. We
all wondered—we that they were so great, and he that we
had never heard of them.
</p>

<p>
From this his conversation turned to the companies in the
monasteries, and their manners so fragrant unto Thee, and
of the fruitful deserts of the wilderness, of which we knew
nothing. And there was a monastery at Milan full of good
brethren, without the walls of the city, under the care of
Ambrose, and we were ignorant of it. He went on with his
relation, and we listened intently and in silence. He then
related to us how on a certain afternoon, at Treves, when the
Emperor was taken up with seeing the Circensian games, he
and three others, his comrades, went out for a walk in the
gardens close to the city walls, and there, as they chanced to
walk two and two, one strolled away with him, while the other
two went by themselves; and these in their ramblings came
upon a certain cottage where dwelt some of Thy servants,
<q>poor in spirit,</q> of whom <q>is the kingdom of heaven,</q> and
they found there a book in which was written the life of
Anthony. This one of them began to read, marvel at, and be
inflamed by it; and in the reading to meditate on embracing
such a life, and giving up his worldly employments to serve
Thee.… Then Pontitianus, and he that had walked with
him through other parts of the garden, came in search of them
to the same place, and, having found them, advised them to
return as the day had declined.… But the other two,
<pb n='410'/><anchor id='Pg410'/>
setting their affections upon heavenly things, remained in the
cottage. And both of them had affianced brides who also,
when they heard of this, dedicated their virginity to God.

virtues of a monk. Accordingly he made use for some time of
the cell connected with the church; but afterward, when he
felt it impossible to tolerate the disturbance of the numbers
of those visiting it, he established a monastery for himself
about two miles outside the city. This spot was so secret
and retired that he did not desire the solitude of a hermit.
For, on one side, it was surrounded by a precipitous rock of
a lofty mountain; while the river Loire has shut in the rest
of the plain by a bend extending back for a distance. The
place could be approached by only one passage, and that
very narrow. Here, then, he possessed a cell constructed of
wood; many also of the brethren had, in the same manner,
fashioned retreats for themselves, but most of them had
formed these out of the rock of the overhanging mountain,
hollowed out into caves. There were altogether eighty disciples,
who were being disciplined after the example of the
saintly master. No one there had anything which was called
his own; all things were possessed in common. It was not
<pb n='411'/><anchor id='Pg411'/>
allowed either to buy or sell anything, as is the custom
amongst most monks. No art was practised there except
that of transcribers, and even to this the more youthful
were assigned, while the elders spent their time in prayer.
Rarely did any of them go beyond the cell unless when
they assembled at the place of prayer. They all took their
food together after the hour of fasting was past. No one
used wine except when illness compelled him. Most of them
were dressed in garments of camel's hair. Any dress approaching
softness was there deemed criminal, and this must
be thought the more remarkable because many among them
were such as are deemed of noble rank, who though very differently
brought up had forced themselves down to this degree
of humility and patience, and we have seen many of these
afterward as bishops. For what city or church could there
be that would not desire to have its priest from the monastery
of Martin?

<head>§ 78. Celibacy of the Clergy and the Regulation of
Clerical Marriage</head>

<p>
The insistence upon clerical celibacy and even the mere
regulation of the marriage of the clergy contributed not a
little to making a clear distinction between the clergy and
the laity which became a marked feature in the constitution
of the Church. The East and the West have always differed
as to clerical marriage. In the East the parish clergy have
always been married; the bishops formerly married have long
since been exclusively of the unmarried clergy. The clergy
who do not marry become monks. This seems to have been
the solution of practical difficulties which were found to arise
in that part of the Church in connection with general clerical
celibacy. In the West the celibacy of the clergy as a
body was an ideal from the beginning of the fourth century,
and became an established principle by the middle of the
fifth century under Leo the Great, though as a matter of fact
<pb n='412'/><anchor id='Pg412'/>
it was not enforced as a universal obligation of the clerical
order until the reforms of Gregory VII. In the following
canons and documents the division is made between the
East and the West, and the selected documents are arranged
chronologically so as to show the progress in legislation toward
the condition that afterward became dominant in the respective
divisions of the Empire and the Church.

In the East, indeed, all clergymen

of their own accord and not by the necessity of law; for
many of them have had children by their lawful wives during
their episcopate. The author of the usage which obtains
in Thessaly was Heliodorus, bishop of Tricca in that country,

<quote rend="display">
The Trullan Council fixed the practice of the Eastern churches regarding
the celibacy of the clergy. In general it may be said that the
clergyman was not allowed to marry after ordination. But if he married
before ordination he did not, except in the case of the bishops
separate from his wife, but lived with her in lawful marital relations.

Canon 6. Since it is declared in the Apostolic Canons that
of those who are advanced to the clergy unmarried, only
lectors and cantors are able to marry, we also, maintaining
this, determine that henceforth it is in nowise lawful for any
subdeacon, deacon, or presbyter after his ordination to contract
matrimony; but if he shall have dared to do so, let him
be deposed. And if any of those who enter the clergy wishes
to be joined to a wife in lawful marriage before he is ordained
subdeacon, deacon, or presbyter, let it be done.
</p>

<p>
Canon 12. Moreover, it has also come to our knowledge
that in Africa and Libya and in other places the most God-beloved
bishops in those parts do not refuse to live with their
wives, even after consecration, thereby giving scandal and
offence to the people. Since, therefore, it is our particular
care that all things tend to the good of the flock placed in our
hands and committed to us, it has seemed good that henceforth
nothing of the kind shall in any way occur.… But
if any shall have been observed to do such a thing, let him be
deposed.

<p>
Canon 13. [Text in Kirch, nn. 985 <hi rend='italic'>ff.</hi>] Since we know it
to be handed down as a rule of the Roman Church that those
who are deemed worthy to be advanced to the diaconate and
presbyterate should promise no longer to cohabit with their
wives, we, preserving the ancient rule and apostolic perfection
and order, will that lawful marriage of men who are in holy
orders be from this time forward firm, by no means dissolving
their union with their wives nor depriving them of their
mutual intercourse at a convenient season.… For it is
meet that they who assist at the divine altar should be absolutely
continent when they are handling holy things, in order
that they may be able to obtain from God what they ask in

Ch. 7 (§ 8). Why did He admonish them to whom the holy
of holies was committed, Be ye holy, because I the Lord
your God am holy? [Lev. 20:7.] Why were they commanded
to dwell in the temple in the year of their turn to
officiate, afar from their own homes? Evidently it was for
the reason that they might not be able to maintain their
<pb n='416'/><anchor id='Pg416'/>
marital relations with their wives, so that, adorned with a
pure conscience, they might offer to God an acceptable sacrifice.
After the time of their service was accomplished they
were permitted to resume their marital relations for the sake
of continuing the succession, because only from the tribe of
Levi was it ordained that any one should be admitted to the
priesthood.… Wherefore also our Lord Jesus, when by
His coming He brought us light, solemnly affirmed in the Gospel
that He came not to destroy but to fulfil the law. And
therefore He who is the bridegroom of the Church wished
that its form should be resplendent with chastity, so that in
the day of Judgment, when He should come again, He might
find it without spot or blemish, as He taught by His Apostle.
And by the rule of its ordinances which may not be gainsaid,
we who are priests and Levites are bound from the day of our
ordination to keep our bodies in soberness and modesty, so
that in those sacrifices which we offer daily to our God we may
please Him in all things.

Ch. 15 (§ 20). To each of the cases, which by our son

the canons and to observe the decretals that have been drawn

but also of the Carthaginians, the Bætici, the Lusitani, and
the Gauls, and those who in neighboring provinces border
upon you, those things which by us have been helpfully
decreed may be sent accompanied by your letters. And
although no priest of the Lord is free to ignore the statutes
of the Apostolic See and the venerable definitions of the
canons, yet it would be more useful and, on account of the
long time you have been in holy orders, exceedingly glorious
for you, beloved, if those things which have been written you

Reply. The same law of continence is for the ministers of
the altar as for the bishops and priests who, when they were
laymen, could lawfully marry and procreate children. But
when they attained to the said ranks, what was before lawful
became unlawful for them. And therefore in order that their
wedlock may become spiritual instead of carnal, it is necessary
that they do not put away their wives<note place="foot">This last

<head>Period II. The Church From The Permanent Division Of The Empire Until The
Collapse Of The Western Empire And The First Schism Between The East And The
West, Or Until About A. D. 500</head>

<p>
In the second period of the history of the Church under the
Christian Empire, the Church, although existing in two divisions
of the Empire and experiencing very different political
fortunes, may still be regarded as forming a whole. The
theological controversies distracting the Church, although
different in the two halves of the Græco-Roman world, were
felt to some extent in both divisions of the Empire and not
merely in the one in which they were principally fought out;
and in the condemnation of heresy, each half of the Church
assisted the other. Though already marked lines of cleavage
are clearly perceptible, and in the West the dominating personality
of Augustine forwarded the development of the characteristic
theology of the West, setting aside the Greek influences
exerted through Hilary, Ambrose, Rufinus, and Jerome,
and adding much that was never appreciated in the East—yet
the opponent of Augustine was condemned at the general
council of Ephesus, 431, held by Eastern bishops in the East;
and at the same time in the East the controversies regarding
the union of the divine and human natures in Christ, although
of interest almost entirely in the East and fought out by men
of the East, found their preliminary solution at Chalcedon
in 451 upon a basis proposed by the West. On the other
hand, the attitudes of the two halves of the Church toward
<pb n='420'/><anchor id='Pg420'/>
many profound problems were radically different, and the
emergence of the Roman See as the great centre of the West
amid the overturn of the Roman world by the barbarians,
and the steadily increasing ascendency of the State over the
Church in the East tended inevitably to separate ecclesiastically
as well as politically the two divisions of the Empire.
As the emperors of the East attempted to use dogmatic
parties in the support of a political policy, the differences
between the Church of the East, under the Roman Emperor,
and the Church of the West, where the imperial authority
had ceased to be a reality, became manifest in a schism resulting
from the Monophysite controversy and the attempt to
reconcile the Monophysites.

<head>Chapter I. The Church At The Beginning Of The Permanent Separation Of
The Two Parts Of The Roman Empire</head>

<p>
Although Theodosius the Great had been the dominating
power in the government of the Empire almost from his accession
in 379, he was sole ruler of the united Roman Empire for
only a few months before his death in 395. The East and the
West became henceforth permanently divided after having
been united, since the reorganization of the Empire under Diocletian
in 285, for only three periods aggregating twenty-eight
years in all. The imperial authority was divided between the
sons of Theodosius, Arcadius taking the sovereignty of the
East and Honorius that of the West. Stilicho, a Vandal,
directed the fortunes of the West until his death in 408, but
the Empire of the East soon began to take a leading part,
especially after the barbarians commenced to invade the
West about 405, and to establish independent kingdoms within the
boundaries of the Empire. The German tribes that
settled within the Empire were either Arians when they
entered or became such almost immediately after; this Arianism
had been introduced among the West Goths from Constantinople
<pb n='421'/><anchor id='Pg421'/>
during the dominance of that creed. The Franks
alone of all the Germanic tribes were heathen when they
settled within the Empire.

The greatest event in the first half of the fifth century, the
period in which the degenerate descendants of Theodosius
still retained the imperial title, was the Barbarian Invasion,
a truly epoch-making event. In 405 the Vandals, Alans,
and Suevi crossed the Rhine, followed later by the Burgundians.
August 24, 410, Alarich, the king of the West
Goths, captured Rome. In 419 the West Gothic kingdom
was established with Toulouse as a capital. In 429 the Vandals
began to establish themselves in North Africa, and about
450 the Saxons began to invade Britain, abandoned by the
Romans about 409. Although the West was thus falling to
pieces, the theory of the unity of the Empire was maintained
and is expressed in the provision of the new Theodosian Code
of 439 for the uniformity of law throughout the two parts of
the Empire. This theory of unity was not lost for centuries
and was influential even into the eighth century.

<p>
The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian, Augusti, to
Florentius, Prætorian Prefect of the East.
</p>

<p>
Our clemency has often been at a loss to understand the
cause of the fact that, although so many rewards are held out
for the maintenance of arts and studies, so few and rare are
they who are fully endowed with a knowledge of the civil law,
and that although so many have grown pale from late studies,
scarcely one or two have gained a sound and complete learning.
When we consider the enormous multitude of books,
the diversity in the forms of process, and the difficulty of
legal cases, and, further, the huge mass of imperial constitutions
which, hidden as it were under a veil of gross mist and
darkness, precludes man's intellect from gaining a knowledge
of them, we have performed a task needful for our age, and,
the darkness having been dispelled, we have given light to the
laws by a brief compendium. Noble men of approved faithfulness
were selected, men of well-known learning, to whom
the matter was intrusted. We have published the constitutions
of former princes, cleared by interpretation of difficulties
so that men may no longer have to wait formidable responses
from expert lawyers as from a shrine, since it is quite plain
what is the value of a donation, by what action an inheritance
is to be sued for, with what words a contract is to be made.…
Thus having wiped out the cloud of volumes, on which
many wasted their lives and explained nothing in the end, we
establish a compendious knowledge of the imperial constitutions
since the time of the divine Constantine, and permit no
one after the first day of next January to use in courts and
daily practice of law the imperial law, or to draw up pleadings
<pb n='425'/><anchor id='Pg425'/>
except from these books which bear our name and are kept
in the sacred archives.…
</p>

<p>
To this we add that henceforward no constitution can be
passed in the West or in any other place by the unconquerable
Emperor, the son of our clemency, the everlasting Augustus
Valentinian, or possess any legal validity, except the same by
a divine pragmatica be communicated to us. The same rule
is to be observed in the acts which are promulgated by us in
the East; and those are to be condemned as spurious which
are not recorded in the Theodosian Code [certain documents
excepted which were kept in the registers of bureaux].

The most important missionary work in the early part of
the fifth century was the extension of the work of Ulfilas

the West in Gaul and western Germany. Of the latter the

<p>
The barbarians dwelling beyond the Danube, who are called
Goths, having been engaged in a civil war among themselves,
were divided into two parties; of one of these Fritigernus was
the leader, of the other Athanaric. When Athanaric had
obtained an evident advantage over his rival, Fritigernus
had recourse to the Romans and implored their assistance
against his adversary. When these things were reported to the
Emperor Valens [364-378], he ordered the troops garrisoned
in Thrace to assist those barbarians against the barbarians
fighting against them. They won a complete victory over
Athanaric beyond the Danube, totally routing the enemy.
This was the reason why many of the barbarians became
<pb n='427'/><anchor id='Pg427'/>
Christians: for Fritigernus, to show his gratitude to the Emperor
for the kindness shown him, embraced the religion of
the Emperor, and urged those under him to do the same.
Therefore it is that even to this present time so many of the
Goths are infected with the religion of Arianism, because the
emperors at that time gave themselves to that faith. Ulfilas,
the bishop of the Goths at that time, invented the Gothic letters
and, translating the Holy Scriptures into their own language,
undertook to instruct these barbarians in the divine
oracles. But when Ulfilas taught the Christian religion not
only to the subjects of Fritigernus but to the subjects of
Athanaric also, Athanaric, regarding this as a violation of the
privileges of the religion of his ancestors, subjected many of
the Christians to severe punishments, so that many of the
Arian Goths of that time became martyrs. Arius, indeed,
failing to refute the opinion of Sabellius the Libyan, fell from
the true faith and asserted that the Son of God was a new
God; but the barbarians, embracing Christianity with greater
simplicity, despised this present life for the faith of Christ.

<quote rend="display">
Sulpicius Severus was a pupil of Martin of Tours, and wrote the life
of his master during the latter's lifetime (died 397), but published it
after his death. He wrote also other works on Martin. The astounding
miracles they contain present curious problems for the student
of ethics as well as of history. As St. Martin was one of the most
popular saints of Gaul, and in this case the merits of the man and his
reputation as a saint were in accord, the works of Sulpicius became the
basis of many popular lives of the saint. The following passage illustrates
the embellishment which soon became attached to all the lives
of religious heroes. It is, however, one of the least astounding of the
many miracles the author relates in apparent good faith. Whatever
may be the judgment regarding the miracle, the story contains several
characteristic touches met with in the history of missions in the following
centuries: <hi rend='italic'>e.g.</hi>, the destruction of heathen temples and objects of
worship. This sacred tree also finds its duplicate in other attacks upon
heathen sanctuaries.
</quote>

<p>
Ch. 13. When in a certain village he had demolished a very
ancient temple, and had set about cutting down a pine-tree,
<pb n='428'/><anchor id='Pg428'/>
which stood close to the temple, the chief priest of that place
and a crowd of other heathen began to oppose him. And
though these people, under the influence of the Lord, had
been quiet while the temple was being overthrown, they could
not patiently allow the tree to be cut down. Martin carefully
instructed them that there was nothing sacred in the
trunk of a tree; let them rather follow God, whom he himself
served. He added that it was necessary that that tree be cut
down, because it had been dedicated to a demon [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, to a
heathen deity]. Then one of them, who was bolder than the
others, said: <q>If you have any trust in the God whom you
say you worship, we ourselves will cut down this tree, you shall
receive it when it falls; for if, as you declare, your Lord is
with you, you will escape all injury.</q> Then Martin, courageously
trusting in the Lord, promised that he would do this.
Thereupon all that crowd of heathen agreed to the condition;
for they held the loss of their tree a small matter, if only they
got the enemy of their religion buried beneath its fall. Accordingly
when that pine-tree was hanging over in one direction,
so that there was no doubt as to what side it would fall
on being cut, Martin, having been bound, was, in accordance
with the decision of these pagans, placed in that spot where,
as no one doubted, the tree was about to fall. They began,
therefore, to cut down their own tree with great joy and
mirth. At some distance there was a great multitude of
wondering spectators. And now the pine-tree began to totter
and to threaten its own ruin by falling. The monks at a distance
grew pale and, terrified by the danger ever coming
nearer, had lost all hope and confidence, expecting only the
death of Martin. But he, trusting in the Lord, and waiting
courageously, when now the falling pine had uttered its expiring
crash, while it was now falling, while it was just rushing
upon him, with raised hand put in its way the sign of salvation
[<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the sign of the cross]. Then, indeed, after the
manner of a spinning top (one might have thought it driven
back) it fell on the opposite side, so that it almost crushed the
<pb n='429'/><anchor id='Pg429'/>
rustics, who had been standing in a safe spot. Then truly a
shout was raised to heaven; the heathen were amazed by
the miracle; the monks wept for joy; and the name of Christ
was extolled by all in common. The well-known result was
that on that day salvation came to that region. For there
was hardly one of that immense multitude of heathen who did
not desire the imposition of hands, and, abandoning his impious
errors, believe in the Lord Jesus. Certainly, before
the times of Martin, very few, nay, almost none, in those
regions had received the name of Christ; but through his
virtues and example it has prevailed to such an extent that
now there is no place there which is not filled with either very
crowded churches or monasteries. For wherever he destroyed
heathen temples, there he was accustomed to build,
immediately, either churches or monasteries.

<head>Chapter II. The Church Of The Western Empire In The Fifth Century</head>

<p>
The period between the closing years of the fourth century,
in which the struggle was still going on between heathenism
and Christianity (<ref target="Section_81">§ 81</ref>), and the end of the Roman Empire
of the West is of fundamental importance in the study of the
history of the Christian Church of the West. In this period
were laid the foundations for its characteristic theology and
its ecclesiastical organization. The former was the work of
St. Augustine, the most powerful religious personality of the
Western Church. In this he built partly upon the traditions
of the West, but also, largely, upon his own religious experience
(<ref target="Section_82">§ 82</ref>). These elements were developed and modified by the
two great controversies in which, by discussion, he formulated
more completely than ever had been done before the idea
of the Church and its sacraments in opposition to the Donatists
(<ref target="Section_83">§ 83</ref>), and the doctrines of sin and grace in
opposition to a moralistic Christianity, represented by Pelagius
(<ref target="Section_84">§ 84</ref>). The
leading ideas of Augustine, however, could be appropriated
only as they were modified and brought into conformity with
<pb n='430'/><anchor id='Pg430'/>
the dominant ecclesiastical and sacramental system of the
Church, in the semi-Pelagian controversy, which found a tardy
termination in the sixth century (<ref target="Section_85">§ 85</ref>). In the meanwhile
the inroads of the barbarians with all the horrors of the invasions,
the confusion in the political, social, and ecclesiastical
organization, threatened the overthrow of all established institutions.
In the midst of this anarchy, the Roman See, in
the work of Innocent I, and still more clearly in the work of
Leo the Great, enunciated its ideals and became the centre,
not merely of ecclesiastical unity, in which it had often to
contest its claims with the divided Church organizations of the
West, but still more as the ideal centre of unity for all those
that held to the old order of the Empire with its culture and
social life (<ref target="Section_86">§ 86</ref>).

<head>§ 81. The Western Church Toward the End of the Fourth Century</head>

<p>
Heathenism lingered as a force in society longer in the West
than in the East, not merely among the peasantry, but among
the higher classes. This was partly due to the conservatism
of the aristocratic classes and the superior form in which the
religious philosophy of Neo-Platonism had been presented to
the West. This presentation was due, in no small part, to the
work of such philosophers as Victorinus, who translated the
earlier works of the Neo-Platonists so that it escaped the tendencies,
represented by Jamblichus, toward theurgy and magic,
and an alliance with polytheism and popular superstition.
Victorinus himself became a Christian, passing by an easy
<pb n='431'/><anchor id='Pg431'/>
transition from Neo-Platonism to Christianity; a course in
which he was followed by Augustine, and, no doubt, by others
as well.

The conversion of Victorinus.
</quote>

<p>
To Simplicianus then I went—the father of Ambrose,<note place="foot">At
the time a bishop.</note> in receiving Thy
grace,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>I.e.</hi>, Simplicianus had baptized
Ambrose.</note> and whom he truly loved as a father.
To him I narrated the windings of my error. But when I
mentioned to him that I had read certain books of the Platonists,
which Victorinus, formerly professor of rhetoric at Rome
(who died a Christian, as I had heard), had translated into
Latin, he congratulated me that I had not fallen upon the
writings of other philosophers, which were full of fallacies
and deceit, <q>after the rudiments of this world</q> [Col. 2:8],
whereas they, in many respects, led to the belief in God and
His word. Then to exhort me to the humility of Christ,
hidden from the wise and revealed to babes, he spoke of Victorinus
himself, whom, while he was in Rome, he had known
intimately; and of him he related that about which I will not
be silent. For it contained great praise of Thy grace, which
ought to be confessed unto Thee, how that most learned old
man, highly skilled in all the liberal sciences, who had read,
criticised, and explained so many works of the philosophers;
the teacher of so many noble senators, who, also, as a mark of
his excellent discharge of his duties, had both merited and
obtained a statue in the Roman Forum (something men of
this world esteem a great honor), he, who had been, even to
that age, a worshipper of idols and a participator in the sacrilegious
rites to which almost all the nobility of Rome were
addicted, and had inspired the people with the love of <q>monster
gods of every sort, and the barking Anubis, who hold
their weapons against Neptune and Venus and Minerva</q>
[Vergil, <hi rend='italic'>Æneid</hi>, VIII, 736 <hi rend='italic'>ff.</hi>],
and those whom Rome once conquered, she now worshipped, all of which Victorinus, now
<pb n='432'/><anchor id='Pg432'/>
old, had defended so many years with vain language,<note place="foot">This is hardly
fair to Victorinus and his pre-Christian religious views.</note> he
now blushed not to be a child of Thy Christ, and an infant at
Thy fountain, submitting his neck to the yoke of humility,
and subduing his forehead to the reproach of the cross.
</p>

<p>
O Lord, Lord, who hast bowed the heavens and come down,
touched the mountains and they smoked [Psalm 144:5], by
what means didst Thou convey Thyself into that bosom? He
used to read, Simplicianus said, the Holy Scriptures and most
studiously sought after and searched out all the Christian
writings, and he said to Simplicianus, not openly, but secretly
and as a friend: <q>Knowest thou that I am now a Christian?</q>
To which he replied: <q>I will not believe it, nor will I rank
you among the Christians unless I see you in the Church of
Christ.</q> Whereupon he replied derisively: <q>Do walls then
make Christians?</q> And this he often said, that already he
was a Christian; and Simplicianus used as often to make the
same answer, and as often the conceit of the walls was repeated.
For he was fearful of offending his friends, proud demon worshippers,
from the height of whose Babylonian pride, as from
the cedars of Lebanon, which the Lord had not yet broken
[Psalm 29:5], he seriously thought a storm of enmity would
descend upon him. But after that he had derived strength
from reading and inquiry, and feared lest he should be denied
by Christ before the holy angels if he was now afraid to confess
Him before men [Matt. 10:33], and appeared to himself
to be guilty of a great fault in being ashamed of the sacraments
of the humility of Thy word, and not being ashamed
of the sacrilegious rites of those proud demons, which as a
proud imitator he had accepted, he became bold-faced against
vanity and shamefaced toward the truth, and suddenly and
unexpectedly said to Simplicianus, as he himself informed me:
<q>Let us go to the Church; I wish to be made a Christian.</q>
And he, unable to contain himself for joy, went with him.
When he had been admitted to the first sacrament of instruction
[<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the Catechumenate], he, not long after, gave in his
<pb n='433'/><anchor id='Pg433'/>
name that he might be regenerated by baptism. Meanwhile
Rome marvelled and the Church rejoiced; the proud saw and
were enraged; they gnashed with their teeth and melted
away [Psalm 92:9]. But the Lord God was the hope of
Thy servant, and He regarded not vanities and lying madness
[Psalm 40:4].
</p>

<p>
Finally the hour arrived when he should make profession
of his faith, which, at Rome, they, who are about to approach
Thy grace, are accustomed to deliver from an elevated place,
in view of the faithful people, in a set form of words learnt
by heart. But the presbyters, he said, offered Victorinus
the privilege of making his profession more privately, as was
the custom to do to those who were likely, on account of bashfulness,
to be afraid; but he chose, rather, to profess his salvation
in the presence of the holy assembly. For it was not
salvation that he had taught in rhetoric and yet he had publicly
professed that. How much less, therefore, ought he,
when pronouncing Thy word, to dread Thy meek flock, who,
in the delivery of his own words, had not feared the mad multitudes!
So then, when he ascended to make his profession,
and all recognized him, they whispered his name one to the
other, with a tone of congratulation. And who was there
among them that did not know him? And there ran through
the mouths of all the rejoicing multitude a low murmur:
<q>Victorinus! Victorinus!</q> Sudden was the burst of exultation
at the sight of him, and as sudden the hush of attention
that they might hear him. He pronounced the true faith
with an excellent confidence, and all desired to take him to
their hearts, and by their love and joy they did take him to
them; such were the hands with which they took him.

<head>§ 82. Augustine's Life and Place in the Western Church</head>

<p>
Aurelius Augustinus, the greatest of the Latin fathers, was
born 354, at Tagaste, in Numidia. He was educated to be a
teacher of rhetoric, and practised his profession at Carthage,
<pb n='434'/><anchor id='Pg434'/>
Rome, and Milan. From 374 to 383, he was a Manichæan
catechumen, for although his mother, Monnica, was a Christian,
his religious education had been very meagre, and he
was repelled by the literary character of the Scriptures as
commonly interpreted. In 387, after a long struggle, and
passing through various schools of thought, he, with his son
Adeodatus, were baptized at Milan by Ambrose. In 391 he
became a presbyter, and in 394 bishop of Hippo Regius, a
small town in North Africa. He died 430, during the Vandal
invasion. Of his works, the <hi rend='italic'>Confessions</hi> are the most widely
known, as they have become a Christian classic of edification
of the first rank. They give an account of his early life and
conversion, but are more useful as showing his type of piety
than as a biography. From them is learned the secret of his
influence upon the Western world. The literary activity of
Augustine was especially developed in connection with the
prolonged controversies, in which he was engaged throughout
his episcopate (see §§ <ref target="Section_83">83</ref>,
<ref target="Section_84">84</ref>), but he wrote much in addition to
controversial treatises. The group of characteristic doctrines
known as <q>Augustinianism,</q> viz.: Original Sin, Predestination,
and Grace and the doctrines connected with them, were,
to a large extent, the outcome of his own religious experience.
He had known the power and depth of sin. He had discovered
the hand of God leading him in spite of himself. He knew
that his conversion was due, not to his own effort or merit,
but to God's grace.
</p>

<p>
The works of Augustine have been translated in part in
PNF, ser. I, vols. I-VIII. There are many translations of the
<hi rend='italic'>Confessions</hi>; among others, one by E. B. Pusey, in <q>Library of

This is, perhaps, the most famous passage in the <hi rend='italic'>Confessions</hi>. It
came at the end of a long series of attempts to find peace in various
forms of philosophy and religion. Augustine regarded it as miraculous,
<pb n='435'/><anchor id='Pg435'/>
the crown and proof of the work of grace in him. The scene
was in Milan, 387, in the garden of the villa he occupied with his friend
Alypius. The principal obstacle to his embracing Christianity was his
reluctance to abandon his licentious life. To this the reference is made
in the passage from Scripture which he read, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, Rom. 13:13, 14.
</quote>

<p>
When a profound reflection had, from the depths of my
soul, drawn together and heaped up all my misery before the
sight of my heart, there arose a mighty storm, accompanied
by as mighty a shower of tears. That I might pour it all
forth in its own words I arose from beside Alypius; for solitude
suggested itself to me as fitter for the business of weeping.
So I retired to such a distance that even his presence
could not be oppressive to me. Thus it was with me at that
time, and he perceived it; for something, I believe, I had
spoken, wherein the sound of my voice appeared choked with
weeping, and thus I had risen up. He then remained where
we had been sitting, very greatly astonished. I flung myself
down, I know not how, under a certain fig-tree, giving free
course to my tears, and the streams of my eyes gushed out,
an acceptable sacrifice unto Thee. And not indeed in these
words, yet to this effect, spake I much unto Thee—<q>But Thou,
O Lord, how long?</q> [Psalm 13:1]. <q>How long, Lord? Wilt
Thou be angry forever? Oh, remember not against us former
iniquities</q> [Psalm 79:5, 8]; for I felt that I was held fast
by them. I sent up these sorrowful cries: <q>How long, how
long? To-morrow, and to-morrow? Why not now? Why is
there not this hour an end to my uncleanness?</q>
</p>

<p>
I was saying these things and was weeping in the most bitter
contrition of my heart, when, lo, I hear the voice as of a
boy or girl, I know not which, coming from a neighboring
house, chanting and oft repeating: <q>Take up and read; take
up and read.</q> Immediately my countenance was changed,
and I began most earnestly to consider whether it was usual for
children in any kind of game to sing such words; nor could I
remember ever to have heard the like anywhere. So, restraining
the torrent of my tears, I rose up, interpreting it
in no other way than as a command to me from Heaven to
<pb n='436'/><anchor id='Pg436'/>
open the book and read the first chapter I should light upon.
For I had heard of Anthony [see also <ref target="Section_77_e">§ 77,
<hi rend='italic'>e</hi></ref>], that accidentally
coming in whilst the Gospel was being read, he received the
admonition as if what was read was addressed to him: <q>Go
and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt
have treasure in heaven; and come and follow me</q> [Matt.
19:21]. And by such oracle was he forthwith converted unto
Thee. So quickly I returned to the place where Alypius was
sitting; for there had I put down the volume of the Apostles,
when I rose thence. I seized, I opened, and in silence I read
that paragraph on which my eye first fell: <q>Not in rioting
and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in
strife and envying; but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
make not provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof</q>
[Rom. 13:13, 14]. No further would I read; there was no
need; for instantly, as the sentence ended, by a light, as it
were, of security infused into my heart, all the gloom of doubt
vanished away.
</p>

Closing the book, then, and putting either my finger between,
or some other mark, I now with a tranquil countenance
made it known to Alypius. And he thus disclosed to me what
was wrong in him, which I knew not. He asked to look at
what I had read. I showed him; and he looked even further
than I had read, and I knew not what followed. This, in
fact, followed: <q>Him that is weak in the faith, receive ye</q>
[Rom. 14:1]; which he applied to himself, and discovered
to me. By this admonition was he strengthened; and by a
good resolution and purpose, very much in accord with his
character (wherein, for the better, he was always far different
from me), without any restless delay he joined me. Thence
we go to my mother. We tell her—she rejoices. We relate
how it came to pass—she exults and triumphs, and she blesses
Thee, who art <q>able to do exceeding abundantly above all
that we ask or think</q> [Eph. 3:20]; for she perceived Thee to
have given her more for me than she used to ask by her pitiful
and most doleful groanings. For Thou didst so convert me
<pb n='437'/><anchor id='Pg437'/>
unto Thyself, that I sought neither a wife, nor any other
hope of this world—standing in that rule of faith in which
Thou, so many years before, had showed me unto her. And
thou didst turn her grief unto gladness [Psalm 30:11], much
more plentiful than she had desired, and much dearer and
chaster than she used to crave, by having grandchildren of
my flesh.

Ch. 29. My whole hope is only in Thy exceeding great
mercy. Give what Thou commandest and command what
Thou wilt.<note place="foot">This is the phrase which so deeply offended Pelagius;
<hi rend='italic'>Da quod jubes, et jube quod vis.</hi></note>
Thou imposest continency upon us. <q>And when
I perceived,</q> saith one, <q>that no one could be continent except
God gave it; and this was a point of wisdom also to know
whose this gift was</q> [Wis. 8:21]. For by continency are we
bound up and brought into one, whence we were scattered
abroad into many. For he loves Thee too little, who besides
Thee loves aught which he loves not for Thee. O love, who
ever burnest and art never quenched! O charity, my God,
kindle me! Thou commandest continency; give what Thou
commandest, and command what Thou wilt.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 27. Too late have I loved Thee, O fairness, so ancient,
yet so new! Too late have I loved Thee. For behold Thou
wast within and I was without, and I was seeking Thee there;
I, without love, rushed heedlessly among the things of beauty
Thou madest. Thou wast with me, but I was not with Thee.
Those things kept me far from Thee, which, unless they were
in Thee, were not. Thou didst call and cry aloud, and Thou
broke through my deafness. Thou didst gleam and shine
and chase away my blindness. Thou didst exhale fragrance
and I drew in my breath and I panted for Thee. I tasted, and
<pb n='438'/><anchor id='Pg438'/>
did hunger and thirst. Thou didst touch me, and I burned
for Thy peace.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 43. O how Thou hast loved us, O good Father, who
sparedst not thine only Son, but didst deliver Him up for us
wicked ones! [Rom. 8:32.] O how Thou hast loved us, for
whom He, who thought it not robbery to be equal with Thee,
<q>became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross</q>
[Phil. 2:8]. He alone, <q>free among the dead</q> [Psalm 88:5],
that had power to lay down His life, and power to take it
again [John 10:18]; for us was He unto Thee both victor
and the victim, and the victor became the victim; for He was
unto Thee both priest and sacrifice, and priest because sacrifice;
making us from being slaves to become Thy sons, by
being born of Thee, and by serving us. Rightly, then, is my
strong hope in Him, because Thou didst cure all my diseases
by Him who sitteth at Thy right hand and maketh intercession
for us [Rom. 8:34]; else should I utterly despair. For
numerous and great are my infirmities, yea numerous and
great are they; but Thy medicine is greater. We might
think that Thy word was removed from union with man and
despair of ourselves had not He been <q>made flesh and dwelt
among us</q> [John 1:14].

the author was engaged upon it from 413 to 426. It was

Compare the position of Augustine with the following passage from
St. Ambrose, <hi rend='italic'>On the Death of Satyrus</hi>, II, 6,
<q>Death is alike to all,
without difference for the poor, without exception for the rich. And
so although through the sin of one alone, yet it passed upon all; … In
Adam I fell, in Adam I was cast out of paradise. In Adam I died;
<pb n='439'/><anchor id='Pg439'/>
how shall the Lord call me back, except He find me in Adam; guilty
as I was in him, so now justified in Christ.</q> [MSL, 16:1374.]
</quote>

<p>
The first men would not have suffered death if they had not
sinned.… But having become sinners they were so punished
with death, that whatsoever sprang from their stock
should also be punished with the same death. For nothing
else could be born of them than what they themselves had
been. The condemnation changed their nature for the worse
in proportion to the greatness of their sin, so that what was
before as punishment in the man who had first sinned, followed
as of nature in others who were born.… In the first
man, therefore, the whole human nature was to be transmitted
by the woman to posterity when that conjugal union received
the divine sentence of its own condemnation; and what man
was made, not when he was created but when he sinned, and
was punished, this he propagated, so far as the origin of sin
and death are concerned.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 14. For God, the author of natures, not of vices,
created man upright; but man, being by his own will corrupt
and justly condemned, begot corrupted and condemned children.
For we were all in that one man when we were all that
one man, who fell into sin by the woman who had been made
from him before the sin. For not yet was the particular form
created and distributed to us, in which we as individuals were
to live; but already the seminal nature was there from which
we were to be propagated; and this being vitiated by sin, and
bound by the chain of death, and justly condemned, man
could not be born of man in any other state. And thus from
the bad use of free will, there originated a whole series of
evils, which with its train of miseries conducts the human
race from its depraved origin, as from a corrupt root, on to
the destruction of the second death, which has no end, those
only being excepted who are freed by the grace of God.

Grace and Free Will.
</quote>

<pb n='440'/><anchor id='Pg440'/>

<p>
Now the Lord not only shows us what evil we should shun,
and what good we should do, which is all the letter of the law
can do; but moreover He helps us that we may shun evil and
do good [Psalm 37:27], which none can do without the spirit
of grace; and if this be wanting, the law is present merely to
make us guilty and to slay us. It is on this account that the
Apostle says: <q>The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life</q>
[II Cor. 3:6]. He, then, who lawfully uses the law, learns
therein evil and good, and not trusting in his own strength,
flees to grace, by the help of which he may shun evil and do
good. But who flees to grace except when <q>the steps of a
man are ordered by the Lord, and He wills his ways</q>?
[Psalm 37:23.] And thus also to desire the help of grace is
the beginning of grace.… It is to be confessed, therefore,
that we have free choice to do both evil and good; but in doing
evil every one is free from righteousness and is a servant
of sin, while in doing good no one can be free, unless he have
been made free by Him who said: <q>If the Son shall make
you free, then you shall be free indeed</q> [John 8:36].
Neither is it thus, that when any one shall have been made
free from the dominion of sin, he no longer needs the help
of his Deliverer; but rather thus, that hearing from Him,
<q>Without me ye can do nothing</q> [John 15:5], he himself
also says to Him: <q>Be Thou my helper! Forsake me not!</q>

Predestination.

<quote rend="display">
Inasmuch as all men are born condemned, and of themselves have
not the power to turn to grace, which alone can save them, it follows
that the bestowal of grace whereby they may turn is not dependent upon
the man but upon God's sovereign good pleasure. This is expressed in
the doctrine of Predestination. For a discussion of the position of
Augustine respecting Predestination and his other doctrines as connected

I trust that we have already done justice to these great and
difficult questions regarding the beginning of the world, of
<pb n='441'/><anchor id='Pg441'/>
the soul, and of the human race itself. This race we have
distributed into two parts: the one consisting of those who live
according to man, the other of those who live according to
God. And these we have also mystically called the two cities,
or the two communities of men, of which one is predestined
to reign eternally with God, and the other to suffer eternal
punishment with the devil.…
</p>

<p>
Each man, because born of condemned stock, is first of all
born from Adam, evil and carnal, and when he has been grafted
into Christ by regeneration he afterward becomes good and
spiritual. So in the human race, as a whole, when these two
cities began to run their course by a series of births and deaths,
the citizen of this world was born first, and after him the stranger
of this world, and belonging to the City of God,<note place="foot">This
figure of the two cities is the motif of the whole work, in which the
idea is developed in the greatest detail.</note> predestined
by grace, elected by grace, by grace a stranger here
below, and by grace a citizen above. For so far as regards
himself he is sprung from the same mass, all of which is condemned
in its origin; but God like a potter (for this comparison
is introduced by the Apostle judiciously and not
without thought) of the same lump made one vessel to honor
and another to dishonor [Rom. 9:21].

Augustine does not commonly speak of predestination of the wicked,
<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, those who are not among the elect and consequently
predestinated to grace and salvation. As a rule he speaks of predestination in connection

consistency, regarded the wicked as also predestinated is shown by
the following, as also other passages in his works, <hi rend='italic'>e.g.</hi>,

These secrets of the divine Scriptures we investigate as we
can;<note place="foot">He has been explaining the significance of the references to
the three sons of Noah.</note> some in more, some in less agreement, but all faithfully
holding it as certain that these things were neither done nor
recorded without some foreshadowing of future events, and
that they are to be referred only to Christ and His Church,
which is the City of God, the proclamation of which has not
ceased since the beginning of the human race; and we now
see it everywhere accomplished. From the blessing of the
two sons of Noah and from the cursing of the middle son,
down to Abraham, for more than a thousand years, there is
no mention of any righteous person who worshipped God. I
would not, therefore, believe that there were none, but to
mention every one would have been very long, and there
would have been historical accuracy rather than prophetic
foresight. The writer of these sacred books, or rather the
Spirit of God through him, sought for those things by which
not only the past might be narrated, but the future foretold,
which pertained to the City of God; for whatever is said of
these men who are not its citizens is given either that it may
profit or be made glorious by a comparison with what is different.
Yet it is not to be supposed that all that is recorded
has some signification; but those things which have no signification
of their own are interwoven for the sake of the things
which are significant. Only by the ploughshare is the earth
cut in furrows; but that this may be, other parts of the plough
are necessary. Only the strings of the harp and other musical
instruments are fitted to give forth a melody; but that they
may do so, there are other parts of the instrument which are
not, indeed, struck by those who sing, but with them are
connected the strings which are struck and produce musical
notes. So in prophetic history some things are narrated which
have no significance, but are, as it were, the framework to
which the significant things are attached.

Augustine in his teaching combined a number of different theological
tendencies, without working them into a consistent system. His
doctrines of Original Sin, Predestination, Grace are by no means harmonized

Optatus. See below, <ref target="Section_83">§ 83</ref>. There is also a
no small remnant of what
might be called pre-Augustinian Western piety, which comes down
from Tertullian and of which the following is an illustration, a
passage which is of significance in the development of the doctrine

§ 109. The time, moreover, which intervenes between a
man's death and the final resurrection, keeps the soul in a
hidden retreat, as each is deserving of rest or affliction, according
to what its lot was when it lived in the flesh.
</p>

<p>
§ 110. Nor can it be denied that the souls of the dead are
benefited by the piety of their living friends, when the sacrifice
of the Mediator is offered, or alms given in the Church
in their behalf. But these services are of advantage only to
those who during their lives merited that services of this kind
could help them. For there is a manner of life which is
neither so good as not to require these services after death,
nor so bad that these services are of no avail after death.
There is, on the other hand, a kind of life so good as not to
require them; and again one so bad that when they depart
this life they render no help. Therefore it is here that all
the merit and demerit is acquired, by which one can either
be relieved or oppressed after death. No one, then, need
hope that after he is dead he shall obtain the merit with
God which he had neglected here. And, accordingly, those
services which the Church celebrates for the commendation
of the dead are not opposed to the Apostle's words: <q>For
we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that
every one may receive the things done in his body, according
to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad</q> [Rom.
14:10; II Cor. 5:10]. For that merit that renders services
profitable to a man, each one has acquired while he lives in
the body. For it is not to every one that these services are
<pb n='445'/><anchor id='Pg445'/>
profitable. And why are they not profitable to all, except
it be because of the different kinds of lives that men lead in
the body? When, therefore, sacrifices either of the altar or of
alms of any sort are offered on behalf of the dead who have
been baptized, they are thanksgivings for the very good; they
are propitiations [<foreign lang="la"
rend="font-style: italic">propitiationes</foreign>] for the not very bad; and for
the case of the very bad, even though they do not assist the
dead, they are a species of consolation to the living. And to
those to whom they are profitable, their benefit consists
either in full remission of sins, or at least in making the condemnation
more tolerable.

<head>§ 83. Augustine and the Donatist Schism</head>

<p>
After the recall of the Donatists by the Emperor Julian,
the sect rapidly increased, though soon numerous divisions appeared
in the body. The more liberal opinions of the Donatist
grammarian Tychonius about 370 were adopted by many
of the less fanatical. The connection of the party with the
Circumcellions alienated others. The contest for rigorism led
by Maximianus about 394 occasioned a schism within the
Donatist body.
</p>

<p>
Augustine's activity in the Donatist troubles began as soon
as he was made bishop of Hippo, as his town was made up
largely of Donatists, who probably constituted more than
a half of the population. The books written by him after
400 have alone survived.
</p>

<p>
The turning-point in the history of Donatism was the
Collatio, or conference, held at Carthage in 411. Two hundred
and seventy-nine Donatist, and two hundred and eighty-six
Catholic, bishops were present. Augustine was one of
those who represented the Catholic position. The victory
was adjudged by the imperial commissioners to the Catholic
party. After this the laws against the sect were enforced
relentlessly, and Donatism rapidly lost its importance. The
Vandal invasion in 429 changed the condition of things for
<pb n='446'/><anchor id='Pg446'/>
a time. The last traces of Donatism disappear only with the
Moslem invasion in the seventh century.
</p>

<p>
The importance of the Donatist controversy is that in it
were defined the doctrines of the Church and of the sacraments,
definitions which, with some modifications, controlled
the theology of the Church for centuries.

sacraments; and it is not valued according to the pride of
persons. Therefore this one dove Christ also calls his beloved
bride. This cannot be among heretics and schismatics.… You

everywhere diffused?
</p>

<p>
Ch. 2. I have proved that that is the Catholic Church, which
spread throughout the whole world, and now are its ornaments
to be recalled; and it is to be seen where the first five gifts
[<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, notes of the Church] are, which you say are six. Among
these the first is the cathedra, and unless a bishop, who is the
angel [the second gift or note according to the Donatists], sit
in it, no other gift can be joined. It is to be seen who first
placed a see and where.… You cannot deny that in the
<pb n='447'/><anchor id='Pg447'/>
city of Rome the episcopal cathedra was first placed by Peter,
and in it sat Peter, the head of all the Apostles, wherefore he
is called Cephas, so that in that one cathedra unity is preserved
by all, that the other Apostles might not claim each
one for himself a cathedra; so that he is a schismatic and a
sinner who against that one cathedra sets up another.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 3. Therefore Peter first sat in that single cathedra, which
is the first gift of the Church, to him succeeded Linus … to
Damasus, Siricius, who is our contemporary, with whom
the world together with us agree in one fellowship of communion
by the interchange of letters. Recite the origin of
your cathedra, you who would claim for yourself the Holy

you see that they who baptize are ministers and are not

The Sixth Book of the same treatise is composed of a statement of the
bishops at the Council of Carthage, and Augustine's answer to each
statement.
</quote>

<p>
<q>Can the power of baptism,</q> says Cyprian, <q>be greater
than confession, than martyrdom, that a man should confess
Christ before men, and be baptized in his own blood, and yet,</q>
he says, <q>neither does this baptism profit the heretic, even
though for confessing Christ he be put to death outside the
Church.</q> This is most true; for by being put to death outside
the Church, he is proved not to have had that charity of
which the Apostle says: <q>Though I give my body to be burned
and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing</q> [I Cor. 13:3].
But if martyrdom is of no avail for the reason that charity
is lacking, neither does it profit those who, as Paul says, and
Cyprian further sets forth, are living within the Church without
charity, in envy and malice; and yet they can both receive
and transmit true baptism. <q>Salvation,</q> he says, <q>is
not without the Church.</q> Who denies this? And therefore
whatever men have that belongs to the Church, outside
the Church it profits them nothing toward salvation. But
it is one thing not to have, another to have it but to no use.
He who has it not must be baptized that he may have it; he
<pb n='449'/><anchor id='Pg449'/>
who has to no use must be corrected, that what he has he may
have to some use. Nor is the water in baptism <q>adulterous,</q>
because neither is the creature itself, which God made, evil,
nor is the fault to be found in the words of the Gospel in the
mouths of any who are astray; but the fault is theirs in whom
there is an adulterous spirit, even though it may receive the
adornment of the sacrament from a lawful spouse. It therefore
can be true that baptism is <q>common to us and to the
heretics,</q> since the Gospel can be common to us, although
their error differs from our faith; whether they think otherwise
than the truth about the Father or Son or the Holy
Spirit; or, being cut away from unity, do not gather with
Christ, but scatter abroad, because it is possible that the sacrament
of baptism can be common to us if we are the wheat of
the Lord with the covetous within the Church and with robbers
and drunkards and other pestilent persons, of whom it is
said, <q>They shall not inherit the kingdom of God,</q> and yet
the vices by which they are separated from the kingdom of
God are not shared by us.

Relation of the sacrament to that of which it is the sign. Sacraments
are effective if no hinderance is placed to their working.
</quote>

<p>
On Easter Sunday we say, <q>This day the Lord rose from
the dead,</q> although so many years have passed since His
resurrection.… The event itself being said to take place
on that day, because, although it really took place long before,
it is on that day sacramentally celebrated. Was not Christ
once for all offered up in His own person as a sacrifice? And
yet, is He not likewise offered up in the sacrament as a sacrifice,
not only in the special solemnities of Easter, but also
daily among our congregations; so that when a man is questioned
and answers that He is offered as a sacrifice in that
ordinance, does he not declare what is strictly true? For if
sacraments had not some points of real resemblance to the
things of which they are the sacraments, they would not be
<pb n='450'/><anchor id='Pg450'/>
sacraments at all. [Augustine's general definition of a sacrament
is that it is a sign of a sacred thing.] In most cases,
moreover, they do, in virtue of this likeness, bear the names
of the realities which they resemble. As therefore in a certain
manner the sacrament of the body of Christ is the body
of Christ, the sacrament of the blood of Christ is the blood of
Christ, so the sacrament of faith is faith.… Now, believing
is nothing else than having faith; and accordingly, when on
behalf of an infant as yet incapable of exercising faith, the
answer is given that he believes, this answer means that he
has faith because of the sacrament of faith, and in like manner
the answer is made that he turns himself toward God because
of the sacrament of conversion, since the answer itself belongs
to the celebration of the sacrament. Thus the Apostle says,
in regard to this sacrament of baptism: <q>We are buried with
Christ by baptism into death.</q> He does not say, <q>We have
signified our being buried with Him,</q> but: <q>We have been
buried with Him.</q> He has therefore given to the sacrament
pertaining to so great a transaction no other name than the
word describing the transaction itself.
</p>

<p>
10. Therefore an infant, although he is not yet a believer
in the sense of having that faith which includes the consenting
will of those who exercise it, nevertheless becomes a believer
through the sacrament of that faith.… The infant, though
not yet possessing a faith helped by the understanding, is not

Augustine in the early part of the Donatist controversy was not in
favor of using force. Like the others, <hi rend='italic'>e.g.</hi>, Optatus, he denied
that force had been employed by the Church. About 404 the situation
changed, and his opinion did likewise. This work, known also as Epistle
CLXXXV, was written circa 417. Compare Augustine's position
with the statement of Jerome, <q>Piety for God is not cruelty,</q>
<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Hagenbach, <hi rend='italic'>History of Christian
Doctrines</hi>, § 135:7. The Donatists had much injured their position by
their treatment of a party which had produced a schism in their own body, the
Maximianists.
</quote>

<p>
§ 22. Who can love us more than Christ who laid down
His life for the sheep? And yet, after calling Peter and the
other Apostles by His word alone, in the case of Paul, formerly
Saul, the great builder of His Church, but previously its
cruel persecutor, He not only constrained him with His voice,
but even dashed him to the earth with His power.… Where
is what they [the Donatists] are accustomed to cry: <q>To believe
or not to believe is a matter that is free</q>? Toward
whom did Christ use violence? Whom did He compel? Here
they have the Apostle Paul. Let them recognize in his case
Christ's first compelling and afterward teaching; first striking
and afterward consoling. For it is wonderful how he
who had been compelled by bodily punishment entered into
the Gospel and afterward labored more in the Gospel than all
they who were called by word only; and the greater fear compelled
him toward love, that perfect love which casts out fear.
</p>

<p>
§ 23. Why, therefore, should not the Church compel her
lost sons to return if the lost sons compelled others to perish?
Although even men whom they have not compelled but only
led astray, their loving mother embraces with more affection
if they are recalled to her bosom through the enforcement
of terrible but salutary laws, and are the objects of far more
deep congratulation than those whom she has never lost.
Is it not a part of the care of the shepherd, when any sheep
have left the flock, even though not violently forced away,
but led astray by soft words and by coaxings, and they have
begun to be possessed by strangers, to bring them back to the
<pb n='452'/><anchor id='Pg452'/>
fold of his master when he has found them, by the terrors or
even the pains of the whip, if they wish to resist; especially
since, if they multiply abundantly among the fugitive slaves
and robbers, he has the more right in that the mark of the

given to a man, this when he is baptized, that when he is ordained; therefore
in the Catholic Church it is not lawful to repeat either.</q>
<hi rend='italic'>Cf.</hi> next passage.</note> So indeed is the error
of the sheep to be corrected that the sign of the Redeemer

stamp by a deserter, who has himself been marked with it, and
they receive forgiveness, and the one returns to his service,
and the other begins to be in the service in which he had not
yet been, that mark is not effaced in either of them, but rather
it is recognized in both, and approved with due honor because
it is the king's. Since they cannot show that that is bad to
which they are compelled,<note place="foot">This was written after the
conference with the Donatists in 411, in which victory was adjudged
to the Catholics.</note> they maintained that they ought
not to be compelled to the good. But we have shown that
Paul was compelled by Christ; therefore the Church in compelling
the Donatists is following the example of her Lord,
though in the first instance she waited in hopes of not having
to compel any, that the prediction might be fulfilled concerning
the faith of kings and peoples.
</p>

<p>
§ 24. For in this sense also we may interpret without
absurdity the apostolic declaration when the blessed Apostle
Paul says: <q>Being ready to revenge all disobedience, when
your obedience is fulfilled</q> [II Cor. 10:6]. Whence also
the Lord himself bids the guests to be brought first to His
great supper, and afterward compelled; for when His servants
answered Him, <q>Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded,
and yet there is room,</q> He said to them: <q>Go out into the
highways and hedges and compel them to come in</q> [Luke
14:22, 23]. In those, therefore, who were first brought in
<pb n='453'/><anchor id='Pg453'/>
with gentleness the former obedience is fulfilled, but in those
who were compelled the disobedience is avenged. For what
else is the meaning of <q>Compel them to come in,</q> after it
had previously been said, <q>Bring in,</q> and the answer was:
<q>Lord, it is done as Thou commandest, and yet there is
room</q>? Wherefore if by the power which the Church has
received by divine appointment in its due season, through
the religious character and faith of kings, those who are found
in the highways and hedges—that is, in heresies and schisms—are
compelled to come in, then let them not find fault because
they are compelled, but consider to what they are so compelled.
The supper of the Lord, the unity, is of the body of Christ,
not only in the sacrament of the altar but also in the bond of
peace.

Authority of the Catholic Church.

This work, written in 396 or 397, is important in this connection as
showing the place the Catholic Church took in the mind of Augustine
as an authority and the nature of that authority.
</quote>

<p>
Not to speak of that wisdom which you [the Manichæans]
do not believe to be in the Catholic Church, there are many
other things which most justly keep me in her bosom. The
consent of people and nations keeps me in the Church; so
does her authority, inaugurated by miracles, nourished by
hope, enlarged by love, established by age. The succession
of priests keeps me, beginning from the very seat of Peter
the Apostle, to whom the Lord after His resurrection gave it
in charge to feed His sheep down to the present episcopate.
And so lastly does the name itself of Catholic, which not
without reason, amid so many heresies, that Church alone
has so retained that, though all heretics wish to be called
Catholics, yet when a stranger asks where the Catholic
Church meets no heretic will venture to point to his own
basilica or house. Since then so many and so great are the
very precious ties belonging to the Christian name which
rightly keep a man who is a believer in the Catholic Church … no
one shall move me from the faith which binds my
mind with ties so many and so strong to the Christian religion.
</p>

<p>
Let us see what Manichæus teaches us; and in particular
let us examine that treatise which you call the Fundamental
Epistle in which almost all that you believe is contained. For
in that unhappy time when we read it, we were called by you
<pb n='455'/><anchor id='Pg455'/>
enlightened. The epistle begins: <q>Manichæus, an apostle of
Jesus Christ, by the providence of God the Father. These
are wholesome words from the perennial and living fountain.</q>
Now, if you please, patiently give heed to my inquiry.
I do not believe that he is an apostle of Christ. Do
not, I beg of you, be enraged and begin to curse. You know
that it is my rule not to believe without consideration anything
offered by you. <q>Wherefore I ask, who is this Manichæus?</q>
You reply, <q>An apostle of Christ.</q> I do not believe
it. Now you are at a loss what to say or do; for you
promised to give me knowledge of the truth, and you force
me to believe something I do not know. Perhaps you will
read the Gospel to me, and from it you will attempt to
defend the person of Manichæus. But should you meet
with a person not yet believing the Gospel, what could you
reply to him if he said to you: <q>I do not believe</q>? For
my part I should not believe the Gospel except the authority
of the Catholic Church moved me. So then I have assented
to them when they say to me, <q>Believe the Gospel</q>; why
should I not assent to them saying to me: <q>Do not believe
the Manichæans</q>?

<head>§ 84. The Pelagian Controversy</head>

<p>
The Pelagian controversy, in which the characteristic teaching
of Augustine found its best expression, may be divided
into three periods. In the first period, beginning about 411,
Pelagius and Cælestius, who had been teaching at Rome
unmolested since 400 and had come to Carthage, probably
on account of the barbarian attack upon Rome, are opposed
at Carthage, and six propositions attributed to Cælestius are
condemned at a council there, where he attempted to be
ordained. Cælestius leaves for the East and is ordained at
Ephesus, 412, and Pelagius soon after follows him. In the
second period, 415-417, the controversy is in the East as well
as in the West, as Augustine by letters to Jerome gave warning
<pb n='456'/><anchor id='Pg456'/>
about Pelagius, and councils are held at Jerusalem and
Diospolis, where Pelagius is acquitted of heresy. This was
probably due as much to the general sympathy of the Eastern
theologians with his doctrine as to any alleged misrepresentation
by Pelagius. But in North Africa synods are also held
condemning Pelagius, and their findings are approved by
Innocent of Rome. But Pelagius and Cælestius send confessions
of faith to Zosimus (417-418), Innocent's successor,
who reproves the Africans and acquits Pelagius and Cælestius
as entirely sound. In the third period, 417-431, the attack
on Pelagius is taken up at Rome itself by some of the clergy,
and an imperial edict is obtained against the Pelagians.
Zosimus changes his opinion and approves the findings of a
general council called at Carthage in 418, in which the doctrines
of original sin and the need of grace are asserted. The
last act of the controversy in its earlier form, after the deposition
of the leading Pelagians, among them Julian, of
Eclanum, their theologian, is the condemnation of Pelagius at
the Council of Ephesus, in 431. <hi rend='italic'>V. infra</hi>,

I. 7. Very ignorant persons think that we do wrong in
this matter to divine grace, because we say that it by no
means perfects sanctity in us without our will: as if God could
impose any commands upon His grace and would not supply
also the help of His grace to those to whom He has given commands,
so that men might more easily accomplish through
grace what they are required to do by their free will. And
<pb n='458'/><anchor id='Pg458'/>
this grace we do not for our part, as you suppose, allow to
consist merely in the law, but also in the help of God. God
helps us by His teaching and revelation when He opens the
eyes of our heart; when He points out to us the future, that
we may not be absorbed in the present; when He discovers to
us the snares of the devil; when He enlightens us with manifold
and ineffable gifts of heavenly grace. Does the man who says
this appear to you to be a denier of grace? Does he not
acknowledge both man's free will and God's grace?

<p>
Now what you [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, Augustine, whom he is addressing] wish
us to understand of the Apostle himself, all Church writers
assert that he spoke in the person of the sinner, and of one
still under the law, who by reason of very long custom of vice
was held bound, as it were, by a certain necessity of sinning,
and who, although he desired good with his will in practice,
indeed, was driven into evil. In the person, however, of one
man the Apostle designates the people who sinned still under
the ancient law, and this people, he declares, are to be delivered
from this evil of custom through Christ, who first of
all remits all sins in baptism, to those who believe on Him,
and then by an imitation of Himself incites them to perfect
holiness, and by the example of virtues overcomes the evil
custom of sins.

Ch. 2. As often as I have to speak of the principles of
virtue and a holy life, I am accustomed first of all to call attention
<pb n='459'/><anchor id='Pg459'/>
to the capacity and character of human nature, and
to show what it is able to accomplish; then from this to
arouse the feelings of the hearer, that he may strive after different
kinds of virtue, that he may permit himself to be
roused to acts which perhaps he had regarded as impossible.
For we are quite unable to travel the way of virtue if hope
does not accompany us. For all attempts to accomplish
anything cease if one is in doubt whether he will attain the
goal. This order of exhortation I follow in other minor writings
and in this case also. I believe it must be kept especially
in mind where the good of nature needs to be set forth the
more in detail as the life is to be more perfectly formed, that
the spirit may not be more neglectful and slow in its striving
after virtue, as it believes itself to have the less ability, and
when it is ignorant of what is within it, think that it does not
possess it.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 3. One must be careful to see to it that … one does
not think that a man is not made good because he can do evil
and is not compelled to an immutable necessity of doing good
through the might of nature. For if you diligently consider it
and turn your mind to the subtler understanding of the
matter, the better and superior position of man will appear
in that from which his inferior condition was inferred. But
just in this freedom in either direction, in this liberty toward
either side, is placed the glory of our rational nature. Therein,
I say, consists the entire honor of our nature, therein its
dignity; from this the very good merit praise, from this their
reward. For there would be for those who always remain
good no virtue if they had not been able to have chosen the
evil. For since God wished to present to the rational creature
the gift of voluntary goodness and the power of the free will,
by planting in man the possibility of turning himself toward
either side, He made His special gift the ability to be what he
would be in order that he, being capable of good and evil,
could do either and could turn his will to either of them.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 8. We defend the advantage of nature not in the sense
<pb n='460'/><anchor id='Pg460'/>
that we say it cannot do evil, since we declare that it is capable
of good and evil; we only protect it from reproach. It
should not appear as if we were driven to evil by a disease of
nature, we who do neither good nor bad without our will,
and to whom there is always freedom to do one of two things,
since always we are able to do both.… Nothing else makes
it difficult for us to do good than long custom of sinning which
has infected us since we were children, and has gradually
corrupted us for many years, so that afterward it holds us
bound to it and delivered over to it, so that it almost seems
as if it had the same force as nature.
</p>

<p>
If before the Law, as we are told, and long before the appearance
of the Redeemer, various persons can be named who
lived just and holy lives, how much more after His appearance
must we believe that we are able to do the same, we who
have been taught through Christ's grace, and born again to be
better men; and we who by His blood have been reconciled
and purified, and by His example incited to more perfect
righteousness, ought to be better than they who were before
the Law, better than they who were under the law.

A certain Cælestius, a eunuch from his mother's womb, a
disciple and auditor of Pelagius, left Rome about twenty years
ago and came to Carthage, the metropolis of all Africa, and
there he was accused of the following heads before Aurelius,
<pb n='461'/><anchor id='Pg461'/>
bishop of that city, by a complaint from a certain Paulinus, a
deacon of Bishop Ambrose of Milan, of sacred memory, as
the record of the acts stands in which the same complaint is
inserted (a copy of the acts of the council we have in our
hands) that he not only taught this himself, but also sent in
different directions throughout the provinces those who
agreed with him to disseminate among the people these
things, that is:
</p>

<p>
1. Adam was made mortal and would have died whether
he had sinned or had not sinned.
</p>

<p>
2. The sin of Adam injured himself alone, and not the
human race.
</p>

<p>
3. New-born children are in that state in which Adam was
before his fall.
</p>

<p>
4. Neither by the death and sin of Adam does the whole
race die, nor by the resurrection of Christ does the whole race
rise.
</p>

<p>
5. The Law leads to the kingdom of heaven as well as the
Gospel.
</p>

<p>
6. Even before the coming of the Lord there were men
without sin.

The confession of faith addressed to Innocent of Rome, but actually
laid before Zosimus, in 417, consists of an admirably orthodox statement
of the doctrine of the Trinity and of the incarnation, an expansion
of the Nicene formula with reference to perversions of the faith
by various heretics, and in conclusion a statement of Pelagius's own
opinions regarding free will, grace, and sin. It is due to the irony of
history that it should have been found among the works of both
Jerome and Augustine, long passed current as a composition of Augustine,

administered to children in the same words of the sacrament
as it is administered to adults.…

<p>
We execrate also the blasphemy of those who say that anything
impossible to do is commanded man by God, and the
commands of God can be observed, not by individuals but by
all in common, also those who with the Manichæans condemn
first marriages or with the Cataphrygians condemn second
marriages.… We so confess the will is free that we say that
we always need the aid of God, and they err who with the
Manichæans assert that man cannot avoid sins as well as
those who with Jovinan say that man cannot sin; for both
take away the liberty of the will. But we say that man can
both sin and not sin, so that we confess that we always have
free will.

Late in 416 synods were held in Carthage and Mileve condemning
Pelagianism. On January 27, 417, Innocent wrote to the Africans, approving
their councils and condemning Pelagianism, incidentally stating
the supreme authority of the Roman See and requiring that
nothing should ever be definitively settled without consulting the Apostolic
See (text of passage in Denziger. ed. 1911, n. 100). September
23 of the same year, about the time when Pelagius and Cælestius were
at Rome with Zosimus seeking to rehabilitate themselves in the West,
Augustine delivered a sermon in which he made the following statement.
It is the basis of the famous phrase <hi rend='italic'>Roma locuta, causa finita

Likewise Pelagius sent letters also containing an extended

They contained all things like those which Cælestius had

In the consulate of the most glorious emperors, Honorius
for the twelfth time and Theodosius for the eighth, on the
calends of May, at Carthage in the Secretarium of the Basilica
of Faustus, when Bishop Aurelius presided over the general
council, the deacons standing by, it pleased all the bishops,
whose names and subscriptions are indicated, met together
in the holy synod of the church of Carthage:
</p>

<p>
1 [109]. That whosoever should say that Adam, the first
man, was created mortal, so that whether he had sinned or
not, he would have died in the body—that is, he would have
gone forth of the body, not because of the desert [or merit] of
sin, but by natural necessity, let him be anathema.
</p>

<p>
2 [110]. Likewise that whosoever denies that infants
newly from their mother's womb should be baptized, or says
that baptism is for remission of sins, but that they derive
from Adam no original sin, which is removed by the layer of
regeneration, whence the conclusion follows that in them
the form of baptism for the remission of sins is to be understood
as false and not true, let him be anathema.
</p>

<p>
For not otherwise can be understood what the Apostle
says, <q>By one man sin has come into the world,<note place="foot">Some manuscripts
add <q>and death through sin.</q></note> and so it
passed upon all men in that all have sinned,</q> than as the
Catholic Church everywhere diffused has always understood
it. For on account of this rule of faith, even infants, who
could have committed no sin themselves, therefore are truly
baptized for the remission of sins, in order that what in them
is the result of generation may be cleansed by regeneration.
</p>

<p>
3 [111]. Likewise, that whoever should say that the grace
of God, by which a man is justified through Jesus Christ our
Lord, avails only for the remission of past sins, and not for
assistance against committing sins in the future, let him be
anathema.
</p>

<p>
4 [112]. Also, whoever shall say that the same grace of
God through Jesus Christ our Lord helps us not to sin only
in that by it are revealed to us and opened to our understanding
<pb n='465'/><anchor id='Pg465'/>
the commandments, so that we may know what to seek,
what we ought to avoid, and also that we should love to do so,
but that through it we are not helped so that we are able to
do what we know we should do, let him be anathema. For
when the Apostle says, <q>Wisdom puffeth up, but charity
edifieth,</q> it were truly infamous were we to believe that we
have the grace of Christ for that which puffeth us up, but have
it not for that which edifieth, since each is the gift of God,
both to know what we ought to do, and to love it so as to do
it; so that wisdom cannot puff us up while charity is edifying
us. For as it is written of God, <q>Who teacheth man knowledge,</q>
so also it is written, <q>Love is of God.</q>
</p>

<p>
5 [113]. It seemed good that whosoever should say that
the grace of justification is given to us only that we might
be able more readily by grace to perform what we were commanded
to do through our free will; as if when grace was not
given, although not easily, yet nevertheless we could even
without grace fulfil the divine commandments, let him be
anathema. For the Lord spake concerning the fruits of the
commandments, when he said, <q>Without me ye can do nothing,</q>
and not <q>Without me ye can do it but with difficulty.</q>
</p>

<p>
6 [114]. It seemed also good that as St. John the Apostle
says, <q>If ye shall say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves
and the truth is not in us</q>; whosoever thinks that this
should be so understood as to mean that out of humility we
ought to say that we have sin, and not because it is really so,
let him be anathema. For the Apostle goes on to add, <q>But
if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins and to cleanse us from all iniquity,</q> where it is sufficiently
clear that this is said not only in humility but also in truth.
For the Apostle might have said, <q>If we shall say we have no
sins we shall extol ourselves, and humility is not in us</q>; but
when he says, <q>we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in
us,</q> he sufficiently intimates that he who affirmed that he
had no sin would speak not that which is true but that which
is false.
</p>

<pb n='466'/><anchor id='Pg466'/>

<p>
7 [115]. It has seemed good that whosoever should say
that when in the Lord's Prayer, the saints say, <q>Forgive us
our trespasses,</q> they say this not for themselves, because
they have no need of this petition, but for the rest who are
sinners of the people; and that therefore none of the saints
can say, <q>Forgive me my trespasses,</q> but <q>Forgive us our
trespasses</q>; so that the just is understood to seek this for
others rather than for himself, let him be anathema.
</p>

<p>
8 [116]. Likewise it seemed good, that whosoever asserts
that these words of the Lord's Prayer when they say, <q>Forgive
us our trespasses,</q> are said by the saints out of humility and
not in truth, let them be anathema.

<head>§ 85. Semi-Pelagian Controversy</head>

<p>
With the condemnation of Pelagianism the doctrine of
Augustine in its logically worked out details was not necessarily
approved. The necessity of baptism for the remission
of sins in all cases was approved as well as the necessity of
grace. The doctrine of predestination, an essential feature
in the Augustinian system, was not only not accepted but was
<pb n='467'/><anchor id='Pg467'/>
vigorously opposed by many who heartily condemned Pelagianism.
The ensuing discussion, known as the Semi-Pelagian
controversy (427-529), was largely carried on in Gaul, which
after the Vandal occupation of North Africa, became the intellectual
centre of the Church in the West. The leading opponent
of Augustine was John Cassian (ob. 435), abbot of a
monastery at Marseilles, hence the term Massilians applied
to his party, and his pupil, Vincent of Lerins, author of
<hi rend='italic'>Commonitorium</hi>,
written 434. The chief Augustinians were Hilary
and Prosper of Aquitaine. The discussion was not continuous.
About 475 it broke out again when Lucidus was
condemned at a council at Lyons and forced to retract his
predestinarian views; and again about 520. The matter received
what is regarded as its solution in the Council of
Orange, 529, confirmed by Boniface II in 531. By the decrees
of this council so much of the Augustinian system as
could be combined with the teaching and practice of the
Church as to the sacraments was formally approved.

<quote rend="display">
John Cassian, born about 360, was by birth and education a man of
the East, and does not appear in the West until 405, when he went to
Rome on some business connected with the exile of Chrysostom, his
friend and patron. In 415 he established two monasteries at Marseilles,
one for men and the other for women. He had himself been
educated as a monk and made a careful study of monasticism in Egypt
and Palestine. Western monasticism is much indebted to him for
his writings. <hi rend='italic'>De Institutis Cœnobiorum</hi> and the
<hi rend='italic'>Collationes</hi>. In the
former, he describes the monastic system of Palestine and Egypt and
the principal vices to which the monastic life is liable; in the latter,
divided into three parts, Cassian gives reports or what purports to be
reports of conversations he and his friend Germanus had with Egyptian
ascetics. These books were very popular during the Middle Ages
and exerted a wide influence.

Ch. 7. When His [God's] kindness sees in us even the very
smallest spark of good-will shining forth or which He himself
has, as it were, struck out from the hard flints of our hearts,
He fans it and fosters it and nurses it with His breath, as He
<q>will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge
<pb n='468'/><anchor id='Pg468'/>
of the truth</q> [I Tim. 2:4].… For He is true and lieth
not when He lays down with an oath: <q>As I live, saith the
Lord, I will not the death of a sinner, but that he should turn
from his way and live</q> [Ezek. 33:11]. For if he willeth
not that one of His little ones should perish, how can we
think without grievous blasphemy that He willeth not all
men universally, but only some instead of all be saved.
Those then who perish, perish against His will, as He testifieth
against each of them day by day: <q>Turn from your evil
ways for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</q> [Ezek. 33:11] …
The grace of Christ is then at hand every day, which,
while it <q>willeth all men to be saved and come to the knowledge
of the truth,</q> calleth all without exception, saying:
<q>Come all unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I
will give you rest</q> [Matt. 11:28]. But if he calls not all
generally but only some, it follows that not all are heavy
laden with either original sin or actual sin, and that this saying
is not a true one: <q>For all have sinned and come short of
the glory of God</q> [Rom. 3:23]; nor can we believe that
<q>death passed on all men</q> [Rom. 5:12]. And so far do
all who perish, perish against the will of God, that God cannot
be said to have made death, as the Scripture itself testifieth:
<q>For God made not death, neither hath He pleasure in the
destruction of the living</q> [Wisdom 1:13].
</p>

<p>
Ch. 8. When He sees anything of good-will arisen in us
He at once enlightens it and strengthens it and urges it on to
salvation, giving increase to that which He himself implanted
or He sees to have arisen by our own effort.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 9. … But that it may be still more evident that
through the good of nature, which is bestowed by the kindness
of the Creator, sometimes the beginnings of a good-will
arise, yet cannot come to the completion of virtue unless
they are directed by the Lord, the Apostle is a witness, saying:
<q>For to will is present with me, but to perform what is
good I find not</q> [Rom. 7:18].
</p>

<p>
Ch. 11. … If we say that the beginnings of a good-will
<pb n='469'/><anchor id='Pg469'/>
are always inspired in us by the grace of God, what shall we
say about the faith of Zacchæus, or of the piety of that thief
upon the cross, who by their own desire brought violence to
bear upon the Kingdom of Heaven, and so anticipated the
special leadings of their callings?…
</p>

<p>
Ch. 12. We should not hold that God made man such
that he neither wills nor is able to do good. Otherwise He
has not granted him a free will, if He has suffered him only to
will or be capable of evil, but of himself neither to will nor be
capable of what is good.… It cannot, therefore, be doubted
that there are by nature seeds of goodness implanted in every
soul by the kindness of the Creator; but unless these are quickened
by the assistance of God, they will not be able to attain
to an increase of perfection; for, as the blessed Apostle says:
<q>Neither is he that planteth anything nor he that watereth,
but God that giveth the increase</q> [I Cor. 3:7]. But that
freedom of will is to some degree in a man's power is very
clearly taught in the book called <hi rend='italic'>The
Pastor</hi>,<note place="foot">Hermas, <hi rend='italic'>Pastor</hi>, Man. VI.
(ANF, vol. II.)</note> where two
angels are said to be attached to each one of us, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> a good and
a bad one, while it lies in a man's own option to choose which
to follow. And, therefore, the will always remains free in
man, and it can either neglect or delight in the grace of God.
For the Apostle would not have commanded, saying, <q>Work
out your own salvation with fear and trembling</q> [Phil. 2:12],
had he not known that it could be advanced or neglected by
us.… But that they should not think that they did not need
divine aid he adds: <q>For it is God who worketh in you both
to will and accomplish His good pleasure</q> [Phil. 2:13].
The mercy of the Lord, therefore, goes before the will of man,
for it is said, <q>My God will prevent me with His mercy</q>
[Psalm 59:10], and again, that He may put our desire to the
test, our will goes before God who waits, and for our good
delays.

The rule of Catholic verity.
</quote>

<quote rend="display">
Vincent of Lerins wrote his <hi rend='italic'>Commonitorium</hi> in 434,
three years after the death of Augustine, who had been commended in 432 to the clergy
of Gaul by Celestine of Rome [<hi rend='italic'>Ep.</hi> 21; Denziger, nn. 128-142; Mansi
IV, 454 <hi rend='italic'>ff.</hi>]. Vincent attacked Augustine in his
<hi rend='italic'>Commonitorium</hi>, not openly, but, so far as
the work has been preserved, covertly, under the pseudonym of
Peregrinus. The work consists of two books, of which
the second is lost with the exception of what appear to be some concluding
chapters, or a summary taking the place of the book. In the
first book he lays down the general principle as to the tests of Catholic
truth. In doing so he is careful to point out several cases of very
great teachers, renowned for learning, ability, and influence, who,
nevertheless, erred against the test of Catholic truth, and brought forward
opinions which, on account of their novelty, were false. It is
a working out in detail of the principles of the idea of Tertullian in his
<hi rend='italic'>De Prœscriptione</hi> [<hi rend='italic'>v. supra</hi>,
<ref target="Section_27">§ 27</ref>]. The Augustinian doctrines of predestination
and grace could not stand the test of the appeal to antiquity.
After laying down his test of truth it appears to have been
the author's intention to prove thereby the doctrine of Augustine
false. The so-called <q>Vincentian rule</q> is often quoted without a
thought that it was intended, primarily, as an attack upon Augustine.
The <hi rend='italic'>Commonitorium</hi> may be found translated in PNF, ser. II, vol.

<p>
Ch. 2 [4]. I have often inquired earnestly and attentively
of very many men eminent for sanctity and learning, how
and by what sure and, so to speak, universal rule I might be
able to distinguish the truth of the Catholic faith from the
falsehood of heretical pravity, and I have always, and from
nearly all, received an answer to this effect: That whether I
or any one else should wish to detect the frauds of heretics
as they arise, or to avoid their snares, and to continue
sound and complete in the faith, we must, the Lord helping,
fortify our faith in two ways: first, by the authority of
the divine Law, and then, by the tradition of the Catholic
Church.
</p>

<p>
But here some one, perhaps, will ask: Since the canon of
Scripture is complete and sufficient for everything, and more
than sufficient, what need is there to add to it the authority
of the Church's interpretation? For this reason: because,
owing to the depth of Holy Scripture, all do not accept it
in one and the same sense, but one understands its words
<pb n='471'/><anchor id='Pg471'/>
one way, another in another way; so that almost as many
opinions may be drawn from it as there are men.… Therefore
it is very necessary, on account of so great intricacies,
and of such various errors, that the rule of a right understanding
of the prophets and Apostles should be framed in
accordance with the standard of ecclesiastical and Catholic
interpretation.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, in the Catholic Church itself all possible care
should be taken that we hold that faith which has been believed
everywhere, always, and by all. For that is truly
and properly <q>Catholic</q> which, as the name implies and the
reason of the thing declares, comprehends all universally.
This will be the case if we follow universality, antiquity, and
consent. We shall follow universality in this way, if we confess
that one faith to be true which the whole Church throughout
the world confesses; antiquity, if we in nowise depart
from those interpretations which it is manifest were notoriously
held by our holy ancestors and fathers; consent in like
manner, if in antiquity itself we adhere to the consentient
definitions and determinations of all, or at least almost all,
priests and doctors.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 23 [59]. The Church of Christ, the careful and watchful
guardian of the doctrines deposited in her charge, never
changes anything in them, never diminishes, never adds; does
not cut off what is necessary, does not add what is superfluous,
does not lose her own, does not appropriate what is
another's, but, while dealing faithfully and judiciously with
ancient doctrine, keeps this one object carefully in view—if
there be anything which antiquity has left shapeless and rudimentary,
to fashion and to polish it; if anything already reduced
to shape and developed, to consolidate and strengthen
it; if any already ratified and defined, to keep and guard it.
Finally, what other objects have councils ever aimed at in
their decrees, than to provide that what was before believed
in simplicity, should in the future be believed intelligently;
that what was before preached coldly, should in the future be
<pb n='472'/><anchor id='Pg472'/>
preached earnestly; that what before was practised negligently,
should henceforth be practised with double solicitude?

Ch. 26 [69]. But what do they say? <q>If thou be the Son

from the doctrine and tradition of that sublime Church, which
is imagined to be nothing less than the very temple of God.</q>

How do you prove it? What ground have you for saying
that I ought to cast away the universal and ancient faith of
the Catholic Church? he has only the answer ready: <q>For it

a thousand examples, a thousand authorities from the
Law, from the Psalms, from the Apostles, from the prophets,
by means of which, interpreted on a new and wrong principle,
the unhappy soul is precipitated from the height of Catholic
truth to the lowest abyss of heresy. Then with the accompanying
promises, the heretics are wont marvellously to beguile

The end of the Semi-Pelagian controversy.

<quote rend="display">
The Council of Orange, A. D. 529, was made up of several bishops
and some lay notables who had gathered for the dedication of a church
at Orange. Cæsarius of Arles had received from Felix IV of Rome
eight statements against the Semi-Pelagian teaching. He added some
more of his own to them, and had them passed as canons by the company
gathered for the dedication. It is noteworthy that the lay
notables signed along with the bishops. Boniface II, to whom the
canons were sent, confirmed them in 532: <q>We approve your above

Canon 1. Whoever says that by the offence of the disobedience
of Adam not the entire man, that is, in body and
soul, was changed for the worse, but that the freedom of
his soul remained uninjured, and his body only was subject
to corruption, has been deceived by the error of Pelagius
and opposes Scripture [Ezek. 18:20; Rom. 6:16; II Peter
2:19].
</p>

<p>
Canon 2. Whoever asserts that the transgression of Adam
injured himself only, and not his offspring, or that death only
of the body, which is the penalty of sin, but not also sin, which
is the death of the soul, passed by one man to the entire human
race, wrongs God and contradicts the Apostle [Rom. 5:12].
</p>

<p>
Canon 3. Whoever says that the grace of God can be bestowed
in reply to human petition, but not that the grace
brings it about so that it is asked for by us, contradicts Isaiah
the prophet and the Apostle [Is. 65:1; Rom. 10:20].
</p>

<p>
Canon 4. Whoever contends that our will, to be set free
from sin, may anticipate God's action, and shall not confess
that it is brought about by the infusion of the Holy Spirit
and his operation in us, that we wish to be set free, resists that
same Holy Spirit speaking through Solomon: <q>The will is prepared
by the Lord</q> [Proverbs 8:35, <hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> LXX; not so in
Vulgate or Heb.], and the Apostle [Phil. 2:13].
</p>

<p>
Canon 5. Whoever says the increase, as also the beginning
of faith and the desire of believing, by which we believe in
<pb n='474'/><anchor id='Pg474'/>
Him who justifies the impious, and we come to the birth of
holy baptism, is not by the free gift of grace, that is, by the
inspiration of the Holy Spirit turning our will from unbelief
to belief, from impiety to piety, but belongs naturally to us,
is declared an adversary of the apostolic preaching [Phil.
1:6; Ephes. 2:8]. For they say that faith by which we
believe in God is natural, and they declare that all those who
are strangers to the Church of Christ in some way are believing.
</p>

<p>
Canon 6. Whoever says that to us who, without the grace
of God, believe, will, desire, attempt, struggle for, watch,
strive for, demand, ask, knock, mercy is divinely bestowed,
and does not rather confess that it is brought about by the
infusion and inspiration of the Holy Spirit in us that believe,
will, and do all these other things as we ought, and annexes
the help of grace to human humility and obedience, and does
not admit that it is the gift of that same grace that we are
obedient and humble, opposes the Apostle [I Cor. 4:7].
</p>

<p>
Canon 7. Whoever asserts that by the force of nature we
can rightly think or choose anything good, which pertains to
eternal life, or be saved, that is, assent to the evangelical
preaching, without the illumination of the Holy Spirit, who
gives to all grace to assent to and believe the truth, is deceived
by an heretical spirit, not understanding the voice of
the Lord [John 15:5], and of the Apostle [II Cor. 3:5].
</p>

<p>
Canon 8. Whoever asserts that some by mercy, others by
free will, which in all who have been born since the transgression
of the first man is evidently corrupt, are able to come
to the grace of baptism, is proved an alien from the faith.
For he asserts that the free will of all has not been weakened
by the sin of the first man, or he evidently thinks that it has
been so injured that some, however, are able without the
revelation of God to attain, by their own power, to the
mystery of eternal salvation. Because the Lord himself
shows how false this is, who declares that not some, but no
one was able to come to Him unless the Father drew him
<pb n='475'/><anchor id='Pg475'/>
[John 6:4], and said so to Peter [Matt. 16:17] and the Apostle
[I Cor. 12:3].
</p>

<quote rend="display">
The canons that follow are less important. The whole concludes
with a brief statement regarding the points at issue, as follows:
</quote>

<p>
And so according to the above sentences of the Holy Scriptures
and definitions of ancient Fathers, by God's aid, we believe
that we ought to believe and preach:
</p>

<p>
That by the sin of the first man, free will was so turned
aside and weakened that afterward no one is able to love God
as he ought, or believe in God, or do anything for God,
which is good, except the grace of divine mercy comes first
to him [Phil. 1:6, 29; Ephes. 2:8; I Cor. 4:7, 7:25;
James 1:17; John 3:27].…
</p>

<p>
We also believe this to be according to the Catholic faith,
that grace having been received in baptism, all who have been
baptized, can and ought, by the aid and support of Christ, to
perform those things which belong to the salvation of the soul,
if they labor faithfully.
</p>

<p>
But not only do we not believe that some have been predestinated
to evil by the divine power, but also, if there are
any who wish to believe so evil a thing, we say to them, with
all detestation, anathema.
</p>

<p>
Also this we profitably confess and believe, that in every
good we do not begin and afterward are assisted by the mercy
of God, but without any good desert preceding, He first inspires
in us faith and love in Him, so that we both faithfully
seek the sacrament of baptism, and after baptism with His
help are able to perform those things which are pleasing to
Him. Whence it is most certainly to be believed that in the
case of that thief, whom the Lord called to the fatherland of
paradise, and Cornelius the Centurion, to whom an angel of
the Lord was sent, and Zacchæus, who was worthy of receiving
the Lord himself, their so wonderful faith was not of
nature, but was the gift of the divine bounty.
</p>

<p>
And because we desire and wish our definition of the ancient
<pb n='476'/><anchor id='Pg476'/>
Fathers, written above, to be a medicine not only for the
clergy but also for the laity, it has been decided that the
illustrious and noble men, who have assembled with us at
the aforesaid festival, shall subscribe it with their own hand.

<head>§ 86. The Roman Church as the Centre of the Catholic
Roman Element of the West</head>

<p>
In the confusion of the fifth century, when the provinces
of the Roman Empire were being lopped off one by one, Italy
invaded, and the larger political institutions disappearing,
the Church was the one institution that maintained itself.
In not a few places among the barbarians the bishops became
the acknowledged heads of the Roman element of the communities.
In meeting the threatened invasion of Italy by
Attila, Leo was the representative of the Roman people, the
head of the embassy sent to induce the Hun to recross the
Danube. Under such circumstances the see of Rome constantly
gained in importance politically and ecclesiastically.
As a centre of unity it was far more powerful than a feeble
emperor at Ravenna or puppets set up by barbarians. It
was the one and only great link between the provinces and
the representative of the ancient order. It represented Rome,
an efficient and generally gratefully recognized authority.
In the development of the papal idea the first stadium was
completed with the pontificate of Leo the Great (440-461),
who, fully conscious of the inherited Petrine prerogatives,
expressed them the most clearly, persistently, and, on the
whole, most successfully of any pontiff before Gregory the
Great. Leo, therefore, stands at the end of a development
marked by the utterances of Victor, Cornelius, Siricius, Innocent I,
Zosimus, Boniface I, and Celestine. For their statements
of the authority of the Roman see, see Denziger, under
their names, also Kirch and Mirbt. The whole may be found
combined in one statement in Schwanne, <hi rend='italic'>Dogmengeschichte</hi>, I,

<p>
Ch. 2. … From His overruling and eternal providence
we have received also the support of the Apostle's aid, which
assuredly does not cease from its operation; and the strength
of the foundation, on which the whole lofty building of the
Church is reared, is not weakened by the weight of the temple
that rests upon it. For the solidity of that faith which
was praised in the chief of the Apostles is perpetual; and, as
that remains which Peter believed in Christ, so that remains
which Christ instituted in Peter. For when, as has been read
in the Gospel lesson [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, for the day], the Lord has asked the
disciples whom they believed Him to be, amid the various
opinions that were held, the blessed Peter replied, saying:
<q>Thou art the Christ,</q> etc. [Matt. 16:16-19].
</p>

<p>
Ch. 3. The dispensation of the truth therefore abides,
and the blessed Peter, persevering in the strength of the rock
which he has received, has not abandoned the helm of the
Church which he undertook. For he was ordained before
the rest in such a way that since he is called the rock, since
he is pronounced the foundation, since he is constituted the
doorkeeper of the kingdom of heaven, since he is set up as
the judge to bind and to loose, whose judgments shall retain
their validity in heaven, from all these mystical titles we might
know the nature of his association with Christ. And still
to-day he more fully and effectually performs what is intrusted
to him, and carries out every part of his duty and
charge in Him and with Him, through whom he has been
glorified. And so if anything is rightly done or rightly decreed
by us, if anything is obtained from the mercy of God
by daily supplications, it is his work and merits whose power
<pb n='478'/><anchor id='Pg478'/>
lives in his see and whose authority excels. For this, dearly
beloved, that confession gained, that confession which, inspired
in the Apostle's heart by God the Father, transcends
all the uncertainty of human opinions, and was endued with
the firmness of a rock, which no assaults could shake. For
throughout the Church Peter daily says, <q>Thou art the
Christ, the Son of the living God,</q> and every tongue which
confesses the Lord is inspired by the instruction
[<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">magisterio</foreign>]
of that voice.

of things secular is one, and the basis of things divine another;

he cannot make an apostolic see; and let him on no account
hope to be able to rise by injury to others. For the privileges
of the churches, determined by the canons of the holy Fathers,
and fixed by the decrees of the Nicene synod, cannot be overthrown
by an unscrupulous act, nor disturbed by an innovation.
And in the faithful execution of this task by the aid of

<head>Chapter III. The Church In The Eastern Empire.</head>

<p>
At the beginning of the permanent division of the Empire,
the church life of the East was disturbed by a series of closely
connected disputes known as the First Origenistic Controversy
(<ref target="Section_87">§ 87</ref>), in which were comprised a conflict between a
rationalistic tendency, connected with the religious philosophy
of Origen, and a traditionalism that eschewed speculation, a
bitter rivalry between the great sees of Alexandria, the religious
<pb n='482'/><anchor id='Pg482'/>
and intellectual capital of the East, and Constantinople,
the church of the new imperial city, and personal disputes.
But more serious controversies were already beginning.
While the Church of the West was laying the foundations of
the papal system, the Church of the East was falling more
and more under the dominance of the secular authority; while
the West was developing its anthropology, with its doctrines of
Original Sin, Grace, and Election, the East was entering upon
the long discussion of the topic which had been left by the
Arian controversy—granted that the incarnate Son of God
is truly eternal God, in what way are the divine and human
natures related to the one personality of the incarnate God
(<ref target="Section_88">§ 88</ref>)? The controversies that
arose over this topic involved the entire Church of the East,
and found in the general councils of Ephesus, A. D. 431
(<ref target="Section_89">§ 89</ref>), and Chalcedon, A. D. 451
(<ref target="Section_90">§ 90</ref>), partial solutions. In
the case of each council, permanent schisms resulted,
and large portions of the Church of the East broke away from the previous unity
(<ref target="Section_91">§ 91</ref>); and on account
of the intimate connection between the affairs of the
Church and the secular policy of the Empire, a schism was
caused between the see of Rome and the churches in communion
with the see of Constantinople.

<head>§ 87. The First Origenistic Controversy and the
Triumph of Traditionalism</head>

<p>
In the East the leading theologians of the fourth century
were educated under the influence of Origenism; among these
were Basil of Cæsarea, Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of
Nazianzus. In the West the feeling regarding Origen was
not so favorable, but the Western theologians, Jerome and
Rufinus, who were then living in Palestine, shared in the
general admiration of Origen. But a series of brief controversies
broke out in which the standing of Origen as an orthodox
theologian was seriously attacked, as well as the whole
tendency for which he stood. The result was a wide-spread
condemnation of the spiritualizing teaching of the great Alexandrian,
and the rise of what might be called an anthropomorphic
traditionalism. The first of the three controversies
took place in Palestine, 395-399, and was occasioned by
Epiphanius of Salamis, a zealous opponent of heresy. He
denounced Origen and induced Jerome to abandon Origen;
and Rufinus was soon in bitter enmity with Jerome. The
second controversy took place in Egypt about the same time,
when a group of monks in the Scetic desert, who were violently
opposed to Origenism, compelled Theophilus, bishop of Alexandria
and an admirer of Origen, to abandon that theologian
and to side with them against the monks of the Nitrian desert,
who were Origenists, and to condemn Origen at a council at
Alexandria, 399. The third controversy involved John Chrysostom,
bishop of Constantinople, who had protected four
Nitrian monks who had fled to his protection. Theophilus
seized the opportunity and, with the assistance for a time of
Epiphanius, ultimately brought about the downfall of Chrysostom,
who died deposed and in exile, 404. No controversies
of the ancient Church are less attractive than the Origenistic,
in which so much personal rancor, selfish ambition, mean
intrigue, and so little profound thought were involved. The
literature, therefore, is scanty.

<p>
Of the beliefs and public teachings preserved in the Church,
some we have from written tradition, others we have received
as delivered to us <q>in a mystery</q> by the tradition of
the Apostles; and both of these have in relation to true piety
the same binding force. And these no one will gainsay, at
least no one who is versed even moderately in the institutions
of the Church. For were we to reject such customs as are
unwritten as having no great force, we should unintentionally
injure the gospels in their very vitals; or, rather, reduce our
public definition to a mere name and nothing more. For
example, to take the first and most general instance, who is
there who has taught us in writing to sign with the cross those
who have trusted in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ?
What writing has taught us to turn to the East in our prayers?
Which of the saints has left us in writing the words at the
invocation and at the displaying of the bread in the eucharist
and the cup of blessing? For we are not, as is well known,
content with what the Apostle or the Gospel has recorded;
but, both before and after, we say other words as having great
importance for the mystery, and these we derive from unwritten
teaching. Moreover, we bless the water of baptism
and the oil of chrism, and, besides this, him who is baptized.
From what writings? Is it not from the silent and mystical
tradition? What written word teaches the anointing of oil
itself? And whence is it that a man is baptized three times?
<pb n='485'/><anchor id='Pg485'/>
And as to other customs of baptism, from what Scripture
comes the renunciation of Satan and his angels? Does not
this come from the unpublished and secret teaching which our
fathers guarded in silence, averse from curious meddling and
inquisitive investigation, having learned the lesson that the
reverence of the mysteries is best preserved in silence? How
was it proper to parade in public the teaching of those things
which it was not permitted the uninitiated to look at?

scattered throughout the whole world; and, inasmuch as they
differ among themselves, I am to decide which of them agree
with the Greek original. A pious labor, but a perilous presumption;
to judge others, myself to be judged of all; to
change the language of the aged, and to carry back the world
already grown gray, back to the beginnings of its infancy!
Is there a man, learned or unlearned, who will not, when he
takes the volume into his hands and perceives that what he
reads differs from the flavor which once he tasted, break out
immediately into violent language and call me a forger and a
profane person for having the audacity to add anything to
the ancient books or to change or correct anything? I am
consoled in two ways in bearing this odium: in the first place,
that you, the supreme bishop, command it to be done; and
secondly, even on the testimony of those reviling us, what
varies cannot be true. For if we put faith in the Latin texts,
let them tell us which; for there are almost as many texts
as copies. But if the truth is to be sought from many, why
should we not go back to the original Greek and correct the
mistakes introduced by inaccurate translators, and the blundering
<pb n='486'/><anchor id='Pg486'/>
alterations of confident and ignorant men, and further,
all that has been added or altered by sleepy copyists? I am
not discussing the Old Testament, which was turned into
Greek by the Seventy Elders, and has reached us by a descent
of three steps. I do not ask what Aquila and Symmachus
think, or why Theodotion takes a middle course between the
ancients and the moderns. I am willing to let that be a true
translation which had apostolic approval [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the LXX]. I
am now speaking of the New Testament. This was undoubtedly
composed in Greek, with the exception of the work of the
Apostle Matthew, who first published the gospel of Christ in
Judea and in Hebrew. This [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the New Testament], as it
is in our language, is certainly marked by discrepancies, and
the stream flows in different channels; it must be sought in
one fountainhead. I pass over those manuscripts bearing
the names of Lucian and Hesychius, which a few contentious
persons perversely support. It was not permitted these writers
to amend anything in the Old Testament after the labor
of the Seventy; and it was useless to make corrections in the
New, for translations of the Scriptures already made in the
language of many nations show that they are additions and
false. Therefore this short preface promises only the four
gospels, of which the order is Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
revised by a comparison of the Greek manuscripts and only
of the ancient manuscripts. And that they might not depart
far from the Latin customarily read, I have used my pen with
some restraint, so that having corrected only the passages
which seemed to change the meaning, I have allowed the rest
to remain as it was.

Secondly, that souls are bound in this body as in a prison;
and that before man was made in paradise they dwelt among
rational creatures in the heavens. Wherefore, afterward,
to console itself, the soul says in the Psalms, <q>Before I was

Adam and Eve were clothed after their fall and ejection from
paradise, to be human bodies, and no doubt they were previously
in paradise without flesh, sinews, or bones.

Fifthly, he most openly denies the resurrection of the flesh,
the bodily structure, and the distinction of sexes by which we
men are distinguished from women, both in his explanation
of the first psalm and in many other treatises.
</p>

<p>
Sixthly, he so allegorizes paradise as to destroy the truth
of history, understanding angels instead of trees, heavenly
virtues instead of rivers; and he overthrows all that is contained
in the history of paradise by his tropological interpretation.

<p>
Seventhly, he thinks that the waters which in the Scriptures
are said to be above the heavens are holy and supernal
powers; while those which are upon the earth and beneath
the earth are, on the contrary, demoniacal powers.

To his lord and brother, Simplicianus, Anastasius.
</p>

<p>
It is felt right that a shepherd have great care and watchfulness
over his flock. In like manner, also, the careful watchman
from his lofty tower keeps a lookout day and night on
behalf of the city. In the hour of tempest and peril the
prudent shipmaster suffers great distress of mind lest by the
tempest and the violent waves his vessel be dashed upon the
rocks. With similar feelings that reverend and honorable
man Theophilus, our brother and fellow-bishop, ceases not to
watch over the things which make for salvation, that God's
people in the different churches may not by reading Origen
run into awful blasphemies.
</p>

<p>
Having been informed, then, by the letter of the aforesaid,
we inform your holiness that just as we are set in the city of
Rome, in which the prince of the Apostles, the glorious Peter,
founded the Church and then by his faith strengthened it;
to the end that no man contrary to the commandment read
these books which we have mentioned and the same we have
condemned; and with earnest prayers we have urged that the
precepts of the Evangelists which God and Christ have inspired
the Evangelists to teach ought not to be forsaken; but
that is to be remembered which the venerable Apostle Paul
preached by way of warning: <q>If any one preach a gospel
unto you other than that which was preached unto you, let
him be anathema</q> [Gal. 1:8]. Holding fast, therefore,
this precept, we have intimated that everything written in
days past by Origen that is contrary to our faith is even by
us rejected and condemned.
</p>

<p>
We have written these things to your holiness by the hand
of the presbyter Eusebius, who, being a man filled with a
glowing faith and having the love of the Lord, has shown me
some blasphemous chapters at which we shuddered and which
we condemned, but if any other things have been put forth
by Origen, you should know that with their author they are
alike condemned by me. The Lord have you in safe-keeping,

In this preface Rufinus refers, without mentioning names, to Jerome.
Inasmuch as it was perfectly clear to whom the allusion was made, as
the translator and admirer of Origen, Jerome felt himself personally
attacked and retorted furiously upon Rufinus.
</quote>

<p>
I know that a great many of the brethren, incited by their
desire for a knowledge of the Scriptures, have requested various
men versed in Greek letters to make Origen a Roman and give
him to Latin ears. Among these was our brother and associate
[<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, Jerome], who was so requested by Bishop Damasus,
when he translated the two homilies on the Song of Songs from
Greek into Latin, prefixed to the work a preface so full of
beauty and so magnificent that he awoke in every one the
desire of reading Origen and of eagerly examining his works,
and he said that to the soul of that man the words might well
be applied, <q>The King has brought me into his chamber</q>
[Cant. 2:4], and he declared that Origen in his other books
surpassed all other men, but in this had surpassed himself.
What he promised in his preface is, indeed, that he would
give to Roman ears not only these books on the Song of Songs,
but many others of Origen. But, as I perceive, he is so pleased
with his own style that he pursues an object bringing him more
glory, viz., to be the father of a book rather than a translator.
I am therefore following out a task begun by him and commended
by him.… In translation, I follow as far as possible
the method of my predecessors, and especially of him
whom I have already mentioned, who, after he had translated
into Latin above seventy of the books of Origen, which
he called Homilies, and also a certain number of the tomes
written on the Apostle [the Epistles of St. Paul], since a number
of offensive passages are to be found in the Greek, eliminated
and purged, in his translation, all of them, so that the
Latin reader will find nothing in these which jar on our faith.
Him, therefore, we follow, not indeed with the power of his
eloquence, but as far as we can in his rules and methods:
<pb n='490'/><anchor id='Pg490'/>
that is, taking care not to promulgate those things which in
the books of Origen are found to be discrepant and contradictory
one to the other. The cause of these variations I
have set forth fully in the apology which Pamphilus wrote
for the books of Origen, to which is appended a short treatise
showing how proofs which, as I judge, are quite clear in his
books have in many cases been falsified by heretical and evil-disposed
persons.

The fall of Chrysostom.
</quote>

<quote rend="display">
Epiphanius had gone to Constantinople on the suggestion of Theophilus,
and there, in his zeal, had violated the canons of ordination
as generally received. In this case he had ordained priests in the
diocese of Chrysostom and without his permission. Other troubles
had arisen. On being called to account for his conduct by Chrysostom,
Epiphanius hastily left the city, and died on the voyage back to his
diocese, Salamis, in Cyprus.
</quote>

<p>
When Epiphanius had gone John was informed by some
person that the Empress Eudoxia had set Epiphanius
against him. Being of a fiery temperament and of ready
utterance, he soon after pronounced to the public an invective
against women in general. The people readily took this as
uttered indirectly against the Empress, and so the speech,
laid hold of by evil-disposed persons, was brought to the
knowledge of those in authority. At length the Empress,
having been informed of it, immediately complained to her
husband of the insult offered her, saying that the insult
offered her was an insult to him. He therefore gave orders
that Theophilus should speedily convoke a synod against John;
Severianus also co-operated in promoting this, for he still
retained his grudge [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, against Chrysostom. See DCB,
art. <q>Severianus, bishop of Gabala.</q>]. No great length of
time, accordingly, intervened before Theophilus arrived, having
stirred up many bishops from different cities; but this,
also, the summons of the Emperor had commanded. Especially
did they assemble who had one cause or another of complaint
against John, and there were present besides those
whom John had deposed, for John had deposed many bishops
in Asia when he went to Ephesus for the ordination of Heraclides.
<pb n='492'/><anchor id='Pg492'/>
Accordingly they all, by previous agreement, assembled
at Chalcedon in Bithynia.… Now none of the clergy
[<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, of Constantinople] would go forth to meet Theophilus
or pay him the customary honors because he was openly
known as John's enemy. But the Alexandrian sailors—for
it happened that at that time the grain-transport ships were
there—on meeting him, greeted him with joyful acclamations.
He excused himself from entering the church, and took up his
abode at one of the imperial mansions called <q>The Placidian.</q>
Then, in consequence of this, many accusations began to be
poured forth against John, and no longer was there any mention
of the books of Origen, but all were intent on pressing
a variety of absurd accusations. When these preliminary
matters were settled the bishops were convened in one of the
suburbs of Chalcedon, which is called <q>The Oak,</q> and immediately
cited John to answer charges which were brought
against him.… And since John, taking exception to those
who cited him, on the ground that they were his enemies,
demanded a general council, without delay they repeated their
citation four times; and as he persisted in his refusal to
answer, always giving the same reply, they condemned him,
and deposed him without giving any other cause for his deposition
than that he refused to obey when summoned. This,
being announced toward evening, incited the people to a very
great sedition, insomuch that they kept watch all night and
would by no means suffer him to be removed from the church,
but cried out that the charges against him ought to be determined
by a larger assembly. A decree of the Emperor, however,
commanded that he should be immediately expelled
and sent into exile. When John knew this he voluntarily
surrendered himself about noon, unknown to the populace, on
the third day after his condemnation; for he dreaded any
insurrectionary movement on his account, and he was accordingly
led away.

<head>§ 88. The Christological Problem and the Theological
Tendencies</head>

<p>
The Arian controversy in bringing about the affirmation
of the true deity of the Son, or Logos, left the Church with the
problem of the unity of the divine and human natures in the
personality of Jesus. It seemed to not a few that to combine
perfect deity with perfect humanity would result in two
personalities. Holding fast, therefore, to the reality of the
human nature, a solution was attempted by Apollinarius, or
Apollinaris, by making the divine Logos take the place of the
human logos or reason. Mankind consisted of three parts:
a body, an animal soul, and a rational spirit. The Logos
was thus united to humanity by substituting the divine for
<pb n='494'/><anchor id='Pg494'/>
the human logos. But this did violence to the integrity of
the human nature of Christ. This attempt on the part of
Apollinaris was rejected at Constantinople, but also by the
Church generally. The human natures must be complete if
human nature was deified by the assumption of man in the
incarnation. On this basis two tendencies showed themselves
quite early: the human nature might be lost in the divinity,
or the human and the divine natures might be kept distinct
and parallel or in such a way that certain acts might be assigned
to the divine and certain to the human nature. The
former line of thought, adopted by the Cappadocians, tended
toward the position assumed by Cyril of Alexandria and in
a more extreme form by the Monophysites. The latter line
of thought tended toward what was regarded as the position
of Nestorius. In this position there was such a sharp cleavage
between the divine and the human natures as apparently
to create a double personality in the incarnate Son. This
divergence of theological statement gave rise to the christological
controversies which continued in various forms
through several centuries in the East, and have reappeared
in various disguises in the course of the Church's theological
development.

adoption.

<p>
P. 247 [150]. They who assume a twofold spirit in Christ
pull a stone out with their finger. For if each is independent
and impelled by its own natural will, it is impossible that in
one and the same subject the two can be together, who will
what is opposed to each other; for each works what is willed
by it according to its own proper and personal motives.
</p>

<p>
P. 248 [152]. They who speak of one Christ, and assert
that there are two independent spiritual natures in Him, do
not know Him as the Logos made flesh, who has remained in
His natural unity, for they represent Him as divided into two
unlike natures and modes of operation.
</p>

<p>
P. 239 [129]. If a man has soul and body, and both remain
distinguished in unity, how much more has Christ, who
joins His divine being with a body, both as a permanent possession
without any commingling one with the other?
</p>

<p>
P. 209 [21, 22]. The Logos became flesh, but the flesh
was not without a soul, for it is said that it strives against the
spirit and opposes the law of the understanding. [In this
Apollinaris takes up the trichotomy of human nature, a view
which he did not apparently hold at the beginning of his
teaching.]
</p>

<p>
P. 240 [137]. John [John 2:19] spoke of the destroyed
temple, that is, of the body of Him who would raise it up
again. The body is altogether one with Him. But if the
body of the Lord has become one with the Lord, then the
characteristics of the body are proved to be characteristics
of Him on account of the body.

In this epistle Gregory attacks Apollinaris, basing his argument on
the notion of salvation by incarnation, which formed the foundation
of the most characteristic piety of the East, had been used as a major
premise by Athanasius in opposition to Arianism, and runs back to
Irenæus and the Asia Minor school; see above, <ref target="Section_33">§ 33</ref>.
</quote>

<p>
If any one trusted in a man without a human mind, he is
himself really bereft of mind and quite unworthy of salvation.
For what has not been assumed has not been healed;
but what has been united to God is saved. If only half of
Adam fell, then that which is assumed and saved may be half
also; but if the whole, it must be united to the whole of Him
that was begotten and be saved as a whole. Let them not,
then, begrudge us our complete salvation, or clothe the Saviour
only with bones and nerves and the semblance of humanity.
For if His manhood is without soul [ἄψυχος], even
<pb n='497'/><anchor id='Pg497'/>
the Arians admit this, that they may attribute His passion
to the godhead, as that which gives motion to the body is also
that which suffers. But if He had a soul and yet is without
a mind, how is He a man, for man is not a mindless [ἄνουν] animal?
And this would necessarily involve that His form was
human, and also His tabernacle, but His soul was that of a
horse, or an ox, or some other creature without mind. This,
then, would be what is saved, and I have been deceived in the
Truth, and have been boasting an honor when it was another
who was honored. But if His manhood is intellectual and not
without mind, let them cease to be thus really mindless.
</p>

<p>
But, says some one, the godhead was sufficient in place of
the human intellect. What, then, is this to me? For godhead
with flesh alone is not man, nor with soul alone, nor with
both apart from mind, which is the most essential part of
man. Keep, then, the whole man, and mingle godhead therewith,
that you may benefit me in my completeness. But, as
he asserts [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, Apollinaris], He could not contain two perfect
natures. Not if you only regard Him in a bodily fashion.
For a bushel measure will not hold two bushels, nor will the
space of one body hold two or more bodies. But if you will
look at what is mental and incorporeal, remember that I myself
can contain soul and reason and mind and the Holy Spirit;
and before me this world, by which I mean the system of
things visible and invisible, contained Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost. For such is the nature of intellectual existences that
they can mingle with one another and with bodies, incorporeally
and invisibly.…
</p>

<p>
Further, let us see what is their account of the assumption
of the manhood, or the assumption of the flesh, as they call
it. If it was in order that God, otherwise incomprehensible,
might be comprehended, and might converse with men through
His flesh as through a veil, their mask is a pretty one, a hypocritical
fable; for it was open to Him to converse with us in
many other ways, as in the burning bush [Ex. 3:2] and in
the appearance of a man [Gen. 18:5]. But if it was that He
<pb n='498'/><anchor id='Pg498'/>
might destroy the condemnation of sin by sanctifying like
by like, then as He needed flesh for the sake of the condemned
flesh and soul for the sake of the soul, so also He needed
mind for the sake of mind, which not only fell in Adam but
was first to be affected, as physicians say, of the illness. For
that which received the commandment was that which failed
to observe the commandment, and that which failed to observe
the commandment was that also which dared to transgress,
and that which transgressed was that which stood most
in need of salvation, and that which needed salvation was that
which also was assumed. Therefore mind was taken upon Him.

At the Council of Constantinople held the year after that which is
known as the Second General Council, and attended by nearly the same
bishops, there was an express condemnation of Apollinaris and his

<p>
Concerning the dispensation which the Lord God accomplished
for our salvation in the dispensation according to the
<pb n='499'/><anchor id='Pg499'/>
Lord Christ, it is necessary for us to know that the Lord God
the Logos assumed a complete man, who was of the seed of
Abraham and David, according to the statement of the divine
Scriptures, and was according to nature whatsoever they were
of whose seed He was, a perfect man according to nature,
consisting of reasonable soul and human flesh, and the man
who was as to nature as we are, formed by the power of the
Holy Spirit in the womb of the Virgin, born of a woman, born
under the law, that he might redeem us all from the bondage
of the law [Gal. 4:4] who receive the adoption of sonship
which was long before ordained, that man He joined to himself
in an ineffable manner.…
</p>

<p>
And we do not say that there are two Sons or two Lords, because
there is one God [Son?] according to substance, God the
Word, the only begotten Son of the Father, and He who has
been joined with Him is a participator in His deity and shares
in the name and honor of the Son; and the Lord according to
essence is God the Word, with whom that which is joined
shares in honor. And therefore we say neither two Sons
nor two Lords, because one is He who has an inseparable
conjunction with Himself of Him who according to essence
is Lord and Son, who, having been assumed for our salvation,
is with Him received as well in the name as in the honor of
both Son and Lord, not as each one of us individually is a
son of God (wherefore also we are called many sons of God,
according to the blessed Paul), but He alone in an unique
manner having this, namely, in that He was joined to God
the Word, participating in the Sonship and dignity, takes
away every thought of two Sons or two Lords, and offers
indeed to us in conjunction with the God the Word, to have
all faith in Him and all understanding and contemplation,
on account of which things also He receives from every
creature the worship and sacrifice of God. Therefore we say
that there is one Lord, namely, the Lord Jesus Christ, by
whom all things were made, understanding principally God
the Word, who according to substance is Son of God and
<pb n='500'/><anchor id='Pg500'/>
Lord, equally regarding that which was assumed, Jesus of
Nazareth, who God anointed with the Spirit and power, as in
conjunction with God the Lord, and participating in sonship
and dignity, who also is called the second Adam, according
to the blessed Apostle Paul, as being of the same
nature as Adam.

P. 299. If we distinguish the two natures, we speak of one
complete nature of God the Word and a complete person

P. 312. In the moment in which He [Jesus] was formed
[in the womb of the Virgin] He received the destination of
being a temple of God. For we should not believe that God
was born of the Virgin unless we are willing to assume that
one and the same is that which is born and what is in that
which is born, the temple, and God the Logos in the temple.…
If God had become flesh, how could He who was born
be named God from God [<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Nicene Creed], and of one being

the other only relatively. She bore a man according to
nature, for He was a man who was in the womb of Mary.…

born; not enclosed in Him according to nature, but was in
Him according to the relation of His will.

P. 252. Is Paul a liar when he speaks of the godhead of
Christ and says: <q>Without father, without mother, without
genealogy</q>? My good friend, Mary has not born the godhead,
for that which is born of the flesh is flesh.… A
creature has not born the Creator, but she bore a man, the
organ of divinity; the Holy Ghost did not create God the
Word, but with that which was born of the Virgin He prepared
for God the Word, a temple, in which He should dwell.

<p>
P. 177. Whenever the Holy Scriptures make mention of
the works of salvation prepared by the Lord, they speak of
the birth and suffering, not of the divinity but of the humanity
of Christ; therefore, according to a more exact expression
the holy Virgin is named the bearer of Christ [Christotokos].
</p>

<p>
P. 167. If any one will bring forward the designation,
<q>Theotokos,</q> because the humanity that was born was conjoined
with the Word, not because of her who bore, so we say
that, although the name is not appropriate to her who bore,
for the actual mother must be of the same substance as her
child, yet it can be endured in consideration of the fact that
the temple, which is inseparably united with God the Word,
comes of her.

P. 196. Each nature must retain its peculiar attributes,

one Son.… With the one name Christ we designate at

in the nature of the divinity and in the humanity are
from all eternity distinguished.

<p>
P. 275. God the Word is also named Christ because He
has always conjunction with Christ. And it is impossible

<p>
The flesh is not identical with the godhead before this
is transformed into the godhead, so that necessarily some
things are appropriate to God the Word, other things to the
form of a servant. If, then, he [Eunomius] does not reproach
himself with a duality of Words, on account of such confusion,
why are we slanderously charged with dividing the faith
into two Christs, we who say that He who was highly exalted
after His passion, was made Lord and Christ by His union
with Him who is verily Lord and Christ, knowing by what we
have learned that the divine nature is always one and the
same mode of existence, while the flesh in itself is that which
reason and sense apprehend concerning it, but when mixed
with the divine it no longer remains in its own limitations
and properties, but is taken up to that which is overwhelming
and transcendent. Our contemplation, however, of the
respective properties of the flesh and of the godhead remains
free from confusion, so long as each of these is considered in
itself, as, for example, <q>The Word was before the ages, but
<pb n='503'/><anchor id='Pg503'/>
flesh came into being in the last times.</q>… It is not the
human nature that raises up Lazarus, nor is it the power that
cannot suffer that weeps for him when he lies in the grave;
the tear proceeds from the man, the life from the true Life.…
So much as this is clear … that the blows belong to
the servant in whom the Lord was, the honors to the Lord,
whom the servant compassed about, so that by reason of
contact and the union of natures the proper attributes of each
belong to both, as the Lord receives the stripes of the servant,
while the servant is glorified with the honor of the Lord.
</p>

<p>
The godhead <q>empties</q> itself that it may come within the
capacity of the human nature, and the human nature is renewed
by becoming divine through its commixture with the
divine.… As fire that lies in wood, hidden often below the
surface, and is unobserved by the senses of those who see or
even touch it, is manifest, however, when it blazes up, so
too, at His death (which He brought about at His will, who
separated His soul from His body, who said to His own Father
<q>Into Thy hands I commend My spirit</q> [Luke 23:46],
<q>who,</q> as He says, <q>had power to lay it down and had
power to take it again</q>), He who, because He is the Lord of
glory, despised that which is shame among men, having concealed,
as it were, the flame of His life in His bodily nature,
by the dispensation of His death, kindled and inflamed it
once more by the power of His own godhead, warming into
life that which had been made dead, having infused with the
infinity of His divine power those humble first-fruits of our
nature; made it also to be that which He himself was, the
servile form to be the Lord, and the man born of Mary to
be Christ, and Him, who was crucified through weakness, to
be life and power, and making all such things as are piously
conceived to be in God the Word to be also in that which the
Word assumed; so that these attributes no longer seem to be
in either nature, being, by commixture with the divine, made
anew in conformity with the nature that overwhelms it; participates
in the power of the godhead, as if one were to say
<pb n='504'/><anchor id='Pg504'/>
that a mixture makes a drop of vinegar mingled in the deep

<head>§ 89. The Nestorian Controversy; the Council of Ephesus A. D. 431.</head>

<p>
The Council of Ephesus was called to settle the dispute
which had arisen between Cyril and the Alexandrians and
Nestorius, archbishop of Constantinople, and the Antiochians.
Several councils had been held previously, and much acrimonious
debate. Both parties desired a council to adjust the
dispute. The Emperor Theodosius II, in an edict of November
19, 430, called a council to be held on the following Whitsunday
at Ephesus. The council was opened by Cyril and
Memnon, bishop of Ephesus, June 22, a few days after the
date assigned. This opening of the synod was opposed by
the imperial commissioner and the party of Nestorius, because
many of the Antiochians had not yet arrived. Cyril
and Memnon, who had undertaken to bring about the condemnation
and deposition of Nestorius, forced through their
programme. On June 26 or 27 the Antiochians arrived,
and, under the presidency of John of Antioch, and with the
approval of the imperial commissioner, they held a council
attended by about fifty bishops, while two hundred attended
the rival council under Cyril. This smaller council deposed
Cyril and Memnon. Both synods appealed to the Emperor
and were confirmed by him. But shortly after Cyril and
Memnon were restored. The Antiochians now violently
attacked the successful Alexandrians but, having abandoned
Nestorius, patched up a union with the Alexandrians, by
which Cyril subscribed in 433 to a creed drawn up by the
Antiochians, probably by Theodoret of Cyrus. Accordingly,
the council of Cyril was now recognized by the Antiochians,
as well as by the imperial authority, and became known as
the Council of Ephesus, A. D. 431.

Cyril held a council at Alexandria in 430, in which he set forth the

against any who held the opinions which he set forth in order. Nestorius
immediately replied by corresponding anathematisms. They
may be found translated PNF, ser. II, vol. XIV, p. 206, where they are
placed alongside of Cyril's. In the meantime, Celestine of Rome had
called upon Nestorius to retract, though as a matter of fact the Nestorian

I. If any one shall not confess that the Emmanuel is in
truth God, and that therefore the holy Virgin is Theotokos,
inasmuch as according to the flesh she bore the Word of God
made flesh; let him be anathema.

<p>
II. If any one shall not confess that the Word of God the
Father is united according to hypostasis to flesh, and that
with the flesh of His own He is one Christ, the same manifestly
God and man at the same time; let him be anathema.
</p>

<p>
III. If any one after the union divide the hypostases in
the one Christ, joining them by a connection only, which is
according to worthiness, or even authority and power, and not
rather by a coming together, which is made by a union according
to nature; let him be anathema.
</p>

<p>
IV. If any one divide between the two persons or hypostases
the expressions in the evangelical and apostolic writings,
or which have been said concerning Christ by the saints,
or by Himself concerning Himself, and shall apply some to
Him as to a man regarded separately apart from the Word of
<pb n='506'/><anchor id='Pg506'/>
God, and shall apply others, as appropriate to God only, to
the Word of God the Father; let him be anathema.
</p>

<p>
V. If any one dare to say that the Christ is a god-bearing
man, and not rather that He is in truth God, as an only Son
by nature, because <q>The Word was made flesh,</q> and hath
share in flesh and blood as we have; let him be anathema.
</p>

<p>
VI. If any one shall dare to say that the Word of God the
Father is the God of Christ or the Lord of Christ, and shall
not rather confess Him as at the same time both God and man,
since according to the Scriptures the Word became flesh; let
him be anathema.
</p>

<p>
VII. If any one say that Jesus is, as a man, energized by
the Word of God, and that the glory of the Only begotten is
attributed to Him as being something else than His own; let
him be anathema.
</p>

<p>
VIII. If any one say that the man assumed ought to be
worshipped together with God the Word, and glorified together
with Him, and recognized together with Him as God,
as one being with another (for this phrase <q>together with</q>
is added to convey this meaning) and shall not rather with
one adoration worship the Emmanuel and pay Him one glorification,
because <q>the Word was made flesh</q>; let him be
anathema.
</p>

<p>
IX. If any man shall say that the one Lord Jesus Christ
was glorified by the Spirit, so that He used through Him a
power not His own, and from Him received power against
unclean spirits, and power to perform divine signs before
men, and shall not rather confess that it was His own spirit,
through which He worked these divine signs; let him be
anathema.
</p>

<p>
X. The divine Scriptures say that Christ was made the
high priest and apostle of our confession [Heb. 3:1], and that
for our sakes He offered Himself as a sweet odor to God the
Father. If then any one say that it is not the divine Word
himself, when He was made flesh and had become man as we
are, but another than He, a man born of a woman, yet different
<pb n='507'/><anchor id='Pg507'/>
from Him who has become our high priest and apostle;
or if any one say that He offered Himself as an offering for
Himself, and not rather for us, whereas, being without sin,
He had no need of offering; let him be anathema.
</p>

<p>
XI. If any one shall not confess that the flesh of the Lord
is life-giving, and belongs to the Word of God the Father as
His very own, but shall pretend that it belongs to another who
is united to Him according to worthiness, and who has served
as only a dwelling for the Divinity; and shall not rather confess
that that flesh is life-giving, as we say, because it has been
made the possession of the Word who is able to give life to all;
let him be anathema.
</p>

<p>
XII. If any one shall not confess that the Word of God
suffered in the flesh, and that He was crucified in the flesh,
and that likewise He tasted death in the flesh, and that He is
become the first-born from the dead [Col. 1:18], for as God
He is the life and life-giving; let him be anathema.

the teaching of the Antiochian party. The bitterest period of the
Nestorian controversy was after the council which is commonly regarded
as having settled it. The Antiochians and the Alexandrians
attacked each other vigorously. At last, in 433, John, bishop of Antioch,
sent the creed given below to Cyril of Alexandria, who signed it.
The creed expresses accurately the position of Nestorius. In this way
a union was patched up between the contending parties. But the

characteristics, but distinguishing them as in two natures; and
teaching that the godlike traits are according to the godhead
of Christ, and the humble traits according to His manhood.

<head>§ 90. The Eutychian Controversy and the Council of Chalcedon A. D. 451</head>

<p>
What is known as the Eutychian controversy is less a dogmatic
controversy than a struggle between the patriarchs
of the East for supremacy, using party theological differences
as a support. Few passages in the history of the Church are
more painful. The union made in 433 between the Antiochian
and Alexandrian parties lasted fifteen years, or until after
the death of those who entered into it. At Antioch Domnus
became bishop in 442, at Alexandria Dioscurus in 444, and
at Constantinople Flavian in 446. Early in 448 Dioscurus,
who aimed at the domination of the East, began to attack
the Antiochians as Nestorians. In this he was supported at
Constantinople by Chrysaphius, the all-powerful minister of
the weak Theodosius II, and the archimandrite Eutyches, the
godfather of the minister. Eusebius of Dorylæum thereupon
accused Eutyches, who held the Alexandrian position in an
extreme form, of being heretical on the doctrine of the Incarnation.
Eutyches was condemned by Flavian at an endemic
synod [<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> DCA, I. 474]. November 22, 448. Both Eutyches
and Flavian [<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Leo the Great, <hi rend='italic'>Ep.</hi>
21, 22] thereupon turned to Leo, bishop of Rome. Leo, abandoning the traditional
Roman alliance with Alexandria, on which Dioscurus
<pb n='512'/><anchor id='Pg512'/>
had counted, supported Flavian, sending him June 13, 449, a
dogmatic epistle (the <hi rend='italic'>Tome, Ep.</hi> 28) defining, in the terms
of Western theology, the point at issue. A synod was now
called by Theodosius at Ephesus, August, 449, in which Dioscurus
with the support of the court triumphed. Eutyches
was restored, and the leaders of the Antiochian party, Flavian,
Eusebius, Ibas, Theodoret, and others deposed. Flavian [<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi>
Kirch, nn. 804 <hi rend='italic'>ff.</hi>], Eusebius, and Theodoret appealed to Leo,
who vigorously denounced the synod as a council of robbers
(Latrocinium Ephesinum). At the same time the situation
at the court, upon which Dioscurus depended, was completely
changed by the fall of Chrysaphius and the death of
Theodosius. Pulcheria, his sister, and Marcian, her husband,
succeeded to the throne, both adherents of the Antiochian
party, and opposed to the ecclesiastical aspirations of Dioscurus.
A new synod was now called by Marcian at Chalcedon,
a suburb of Constantinople. Dioscurus was deposed, as well
as Eutyches, but Ibas and Theodoret were restored after an
examination of their teaching. A definition was drawn up
in harmony with the <hi rend='italic'>Tome</hi> of Leo. It was a triumph for
Leo, which was somewhat lessened by the passage of canon
28, based upon the third canon of Constantinople, A. D. 381,
a council which was henceforth recognized as the <q>Second
General Council.</q> Leo refused to approve this canon, which
remained in force in the East and was renewed at the Quinisext
Council A. D. 692.

The position of Eutyches and his condemnation.

<quote rend="display">
Inasmuch as Eutyches was no theologian and no man of letters, he
<pb n='513'/><anchor id='Pg513'/>
has left no worked-out statement of his position. What he taught can
be gathered only from the acts of the Council of Constantinople A. D.
448. These were incorporated in the acts of the Council of Ephesus,
A. D. 449, and as his friends were there they may be regarded as trustworthy.
The acts of the Council of Ephesus, A. D. 449 were read in
the Council of Chalcedon, A. D. 451, and in this way the matter is
known.

The following passages are taken from the seventh sitting of the
Council of Constantinople, November 22, 448.
</quote>

<p>
Archbishop Flavian said: Do you confess that the one and
the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, is consubstantial with
His Father as to His divinity, and consubstantial with His
mother as to His humanity?
</p>

<p>
Eutyches said: When I intrusted myself to your holiness
I said that you should not ask me further what I thought concerning
the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
</p>

<p>
The archbishop said: Do you confess Christ to be of two
natures?
</p>

<p>
Eutyches said: I have never yet presumed to speculate
concerning the nature of my God, the Lord of heaven and
earth; I confess that I have never said that He is consubstantial
with us. Up to the present day I have not said that the
body of our Lord and God was consubstantial with us; I confess
that the holy Virgin is consubstantial with us, and that
of her our God was incarnate.…
</p>

<p>
Florentius, the patrician, said: Since the mother is consubstantial
with us, doubtless the Son is consubstantial with us.
</p>

<p>
Eutyches said: I have not said, you will notice, that the
body of a man became the body of God, but the body was
human, and the Lord was incarnate of the Virgin. If you
wish that I should add to this that His body is consubstantial
with us, I will do this; but I do not understand the term consubstantial
in such a way that I do not deny that he is the
Son of God. Formerly I spoke in general not of a consubstantiality
according to the flesh; now I will do so, because
your Holiness demands it.…
</p>

<p>
Florentius said: Do you or do you not confess that our
<pb n='514'/><anchor id='Pg514'/>
Lord, who is of the Virgin, is consubstantial and of two natures
after the incarnation?
</p>

<p>
Eutyches said: I confess that our Lord was of two natures
before the union [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the union of divinity and humanity in
the incarnation], but after the union one nature.… I follow
the teaching of the blessed Cyril and the holy Fathers and
the holy Athanasius, because they speak of two natures before
the union, but after the union and incarnation they
speak not of two natures but of one nature.

<quote rend="display">
Condemnation of Eutyches.
</quote>

<p>
Eutyches, formerly presbyter and archimandrite, has been
shown, by what has taken place and by his own confession, to
be infected with the heresy of Valentinus and Apollinaris, and
to follow stubbornly their blasphemies, and rejecting our
arguments and teaching, is unwilling to consent to true doctrines.
Therefore, weeping and mourning his complete perversity,
we have decreed through our Lord Jesus Christ, who
has been blasphemed by him, that he be deprived of every
sacerdotal office, that he be put out of our communion, and
deprived of his position over a monastery. All who hereafter
speak with him or associate with him, are to know that they
also are fallen into the same penalty of excommunication.

This letter was written to Flavian on the subject which had been
raised by the condemnation of Eutyches in 448. It is of the first importance,
not merely in the history of the Church, but also in the history
of doctrine. Yet it cannot be said that Leo advanced beyond

Ch. 3. Without detracting from the properties of either
nature and substance, which came together in one person,
majesty took on humility; strength, weakness; eternity, mortality;
and to pay off the debt of our condition inviolable
nature was united to passible nature, so that as proper
remedy for us, one and the same mediator between God and
man, the man Jesus Christ, could both die with the one and
not die with the other. Thus in the whole and perfect nature
of true man was true God born, complete in what was His
and complete in what was ours.…
</p>

<p>
Ch. 4. There enters, therefore, these lower parts of the
world the Son of God, descending from His heavenly seat, and
not quitting the glory of His Father, begotten in a new order
by a new nativity. In a new order: because He who was invisible
in His own nature, was made visible in ours; He who
was incomprehensible [could not be contained], became comprehensible
in ours; remaining before all times, He began to
be in time; the Lord of all, He took upon Him the form of a
servant, having obscured His immeasurable majesty. He who
was God, incapable of suffering, did not disdain to be man,
capable of suffering, and the immortal to subject Himself to
the laws of death. Born by a new nativity: because the inviolate
virginity knew not concupiscence, it ministered the
material of the flesh. The nature of the Lord was assumed
from the mother, not sin; and in the Lord Jesus Christ, born
of the womb of the Virgin, because His nativity is wonderful,
yet is His nature not dissimilar to ours. For He who is true
God, is likewise true man, and there is no
fraud<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>I.e.</hi>, not mere appearance
without reality, as in Docetism and Monophysitism.</note> since both
the humility of the man and the loftiness of God meet.<note place="foot">Hefele.

<pb n='516'/><anchor id='Pg516'/>
as God is not changed by the manifestation of pity, so the
man is not consumed [absorbed] by the dignity. For each
form [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, nature] does in communion with the other what
is proper to it [<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">agit enim utraque forma
cum alterius communione quod proprium est</foreign>]; namely, by the action of the
Word what is of the Word, and by the flesh carrying out what
is of the flesh. One of these is brilliant with miracles, the
other succumbs to injuries. And as the Word does not depart
from equality with the paternal glory, so the flesh does
not forsake the nature of our race.<note place="foot">In explanation of this Leo adds
further on: To be hungry and thirsty, to be weary and to sleep, is clearly human; but
to satisfy five thousand men with five loaves, and to bestow on the woman of Samaria
living water … is, without doubt, divine.… It is not the part of the same nature to
be moved to pity for a dead friend, and when the stone that closed that four
days' grave was removed, to raise that same friend to life with a voice of
command.</note>

<head>(<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>) Council of Chalcedon, A. D. 451,
<hi rend='italic'>Definition</hi>. Mansi, VII, 107.</head>

<quote rend="display">
The definition of Chalcedon lays down the fundamental principles
upon which rests the doctrine of the incarnation, both in Eastern and
Western theology. It is the necessary complement and result of the
discussion that led to the definition of Nicæa, and is theologically second
only to that in importance. At Nicæa the true and eternal deity of
the Son who became incarnate was defined; at Chalcedon the true,
complete, and abiding humanity of manhood of the incarnate Son of
God. In this way two natures were asserted to be in the incarnate
Logos. According to Chalcedon, which came after the Nestorian
and the Eutychian controversies, these natures are neither to be confused
so that the divine nature suffers or the human nature is lost in
the divine, nor to be separated so as to constitute two persons. The
definition was, however, not preceded by any clear understanding of
what was to be understood by nature in relation to hypostasis. This
was left for later discussion. There was even then left open the question
as to the relation of the will to the nature, and this gave rise to
the Monothelete controversy (see § 110).
But the definition of Chalcedon
is important not merely for the history of doctrine but also for
the general history of the Church. The course of Christianity in the
East depends upon the great controversies, and in Monophysitism the
Church of the East was split into permanent divisions. The divisions
of the Eastern Church prepared the way for the Moslem conquests.
The attempts made to set aside the definition of Chalcedon as a political
<pb n='517'/><anchor id='Pg517'/>
move led to a temporary schism between the East and the
West.
</quote>

<quote rend="display">
In this definition, it should be noted, the Council of Constantinople,
A. D. 381, for the first time takes its place alongside of Nicæa and
Ephesus, A. D. 431, and the so-called creed of Constantinople is placed
on the same level as the creed put forth at Nicæa. The creed of Constantinople
eventually took the place of the creed of Nicæa even in
the East.

<p>
The holy, great, and ecumenical synod, assembled by the
grace of God and the command of our most religious and
Christian Emperors Marcian and Valentinian, Augusti, at
Chalcedon, the metropolis of the province of Bithynia, in
the martyry of the holy and victorious martyr Euphemia,
has decreed as follows:
</p>

<p>
Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, when strengthening the
knowledge of the faith in his disciples, to the end that no one
might disagree with his neighbor concerning the doctrines of
religion, and that the proclamation of the truth might be set
forth equally to all men, said: <q>My peace I leave with you,
my peace I give unto you.</q> But since the Evil One does not
desist from sowing tares among the seeds of godliness, but
ever invents something new against the truth, therefore the
Lord, providing, as He ever does, for the human race, has
raised up this pious, faithful, and zealous sovereign, and He
has called together unto Himself from all parts the chief
rulers of the priesthood, so that, with the grace of Christ, our
common Lord, inspiring us, we may cast off every plague of
falsehood from the sheep of Christ and feed them with the
tender leaves of truth. And this we have done, with unanimous
consent driving away erroneous doctrine and renewing
the unerring faith of the Fathers, publishing to all the
creed of the three hundred and eighteen [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the creed of
Nicæa], and to their number adding as Fathers those who
have received the same summary of religion. Such are the
<pb n='518'/><anchor id='Pg518'/>
one hundred and fifty who afterward assembled in great Constantinople
and ratified the same faith. Moreover, observing
the order and every form relating to the faith which was observed
by the holy synod formerly held in Ephesus, of which
Celestine of Rome and Cyril of Alexandria, of holy memory,
were the leaders [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, Ephesus A. D. 431], we do declare that
the exposition of the right and blameless faith made by the
three hundred and eighteen holy and blessed Fathers, assembled
at Nicæa in the reign of Constantine, of pious memory,
shall be pre-eminent, and that those things shall be of force
also which were decreed by the one hundred and fifty holy
Fathers at Constantinople for the uprooting of the heresies
which had then sprung up and for the confirmation of the
same Catholic and apostolic faith of ours.
</p>

<p>
Then follow:
</p>

<p>
<q>The Creed of the Three Hundred and Eighteen Fathers
at Nicæa.</q> The so-called Constantinopolitan creed, without
the <q>filioque.</q>
</p>

<p>
This wise and salutary formula of divine grace sufficed for
the perfect knowledge and confirmation of religion; for it
teaches the perfect doctrine concerning Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, and sets forth the incarnation of the Lord to them that
faithfully receive it. But forasmuch as persons undertaking
to make void the preaching of the truth have through their
individual heresies given rise to empty babblings, some of
them daring to corrupt the mystery of the Lord's incarnation
for us and refusing to use the name Theotokos in reference to
the Virgin, while others bringing in a confusion and mixture,
and idly conceiving that there is one nature of the flesh and
the godhead, maintaining that the divine nature of the Only
begotten is by mixture capable of suffering; therefore this
present, great, and ecumenical synod, desiring to exclude from
them every device against the truth and teaching that which
is unchanged from the beginning, has at the very outset decreed
that the faith of the three hundred and eighteen Fathers
shall be preserved inviolate. And on account of them that
<pb n='519'/><anchor id='Pg519'/>
contend against the Holy Ghost, it confirms the doctrine
afterward delivered concerning the substance of the Spirit by
the one hundred and fifty holy Fathers assembled in the imperial
city, which doctrine they declare unto all men, not as
though they were introducing anything that had been lacking
in their predecessors, but in order to explain through
written documents their faith concerning the Holy Ghost
against those who were seeking to destroy His sovereignty.
And on account of those who are attempting to corrupt the
mystery of the dispensation [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the incarnation], and who
shamelessly pretend that He who was born of the holy Virgin
Mary was a mere man, it receives the synodical letters of the
blessed Cyril, pastor of the church of Alexandria, addressed
to Nestorius and to the Easterns,<note place="foot">See PNF, ser. II. vol. XIV;
To Nestorius, p. 197; To the Easterns, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>,
to John of Antioch (Cyril, <hi rend='italic'>Ep.</hi> 39), p. 251.</note>
judging them suitable for
the refutation of the frenzied folly of Nestorius and for the
instruction of those who long with holy ardor for a knowledge
of the saving symbol. And to these it has rightly added
for the confirmation of the orthodox doctrines the letter of
the president of the great and old Rome, the most blessed and
holy Archbishop Leo, which was addressed to Archbishop
Flavian, of blessed memory,<note place="foot">See above, the <hi rend='italic'>Tome</hi>
of Leo.</note> for the removal of the false doctrines
of Eutyches, judging them to be agreeable to the confession
of the great Peter and to be a common pillar against
misbelievers. For it opposes those who would rend the mystery
of the dispensation into a duad of Sons; it repels from
the sacred assembly those who dared to say that the godhead
of the Only begotten is capable of suffering; it resists those
who imagine there is a mixture or confusion in the two natures
of Christ; it drives away those who fancy His form
as a servant is of an heavenly or of some substance other
than that which was taken of us,<note place="foot">It was charged against Eutyches that
he taught that the Son brought His body with Him from heaven. This Eutyches
denied.</note> and it anathematizes

For the Fathers rightly granted privileges to the throne of
Old Rome, because it was the royal city, and the one hundred
and fifty most religious bishops, moved by the same
considerations, gave equal privileges to the most holy throne
of New Rome, judging with good reason that the city which is
honored with the sovereignty and the Senate, and also enjoys
equal privileges with old imperial Rome, should in ecclesiastical
<pb n='522'/><anchor id='Pg522'/>
matters also be magnified as she is, and rank next after
her; so that in the dioceses of Pontus, Asia, and Thrace the

<head>§ 91. Results of the Decision of Chalcedon: the Rise
of Schisms from the Monophysite Controversy</head>

<p>
The definition of the Council of Chalcedon, in spite of its
condemnation of Nestorius and its approval of the letters of
Cyril, was a triumph of the Antiochian school and a condemnation
<pb n='523'/><anchor id='Pg523'/>
of Alexandrian theology. At Chalcedon no more than
at Nicæa was a controversy settled. So far from being settled
at the council, Monophysitism began with it its long career
in the Eastern Church only to end in permanent schisms.
As soon as the results of Chalcedon were known the Church
was in an uproar. Riots broke out in Jerusalem against the
patriarch. At Alexandria, Timothy Ælurus, a Monophysite,
was able to drive out the orthodox patriarch. In Antioch,
Petrus Fullo did the same and added to the liturgical Trisagion
[Is. 6:3] the Theopaschite phrase: <q>God who was
crucified for us.</q> The Emperor Marcian died 457 and was
succeeded by Leo I (457-474). His grandson Leo II (474)
was succeeded by his father Zeno (474-475, 477-491). Zeno
was temporarily deposed by Basiliscus (475-477), who, basing
his authority upon the Monophysite faction, issued an
Encyclion condemning Chalcedon and Leo's Epistle, and making
Monophysitism the religion of the Empire. Zeno was
restored by a Dyophysite faction under the lead of Acacius,
patriarch of Constantinople. Zeno, to win back the Monophysites,
issued in 482 the <hi rend='italic'>Henoticon</hi>, setting aside Chalcedon
and making only the definition of Nicæa authoritative.
Dissatisfaction arose on both sides, and minor schisms in the
East took place. With Rome a schism arose lasting 484-519.

<p>
Whatever laws the pious emperors before us, who worshipped
the blessed and immortal and life-giving Trinity, have
decreed in behalf of the true and apostolic faith, these laws,
<pb n='524'/><anchor id='Pg524'/>
we say, as always beneficial for the whole world, we will at
no time to be inoperative, but rather we promulgate them as
our own. We, preferring piety and zeal in the cause of our
God and Saviour, Jesus Christ, who created and has made us
glorious before all diligence in human affairs, and also believing
that concord among the flocks of Christ is the preservation
of ourselves and our subjects, the firm foundation and unshaken
bulwark of our Empire, and, accordingly, being rightly
moved with godly zeal and offering to God and our Saviour,
Jesus Christ, the unity of the holy Church as the first-fruits of
our reign, do ordain as the basis and confirmation of human
felicity, namely, the symbol of the three hundred and eighteen
holy Fathers who were in time past assembled with the Holy
Ghost at Nicæa, into which both ourselves and all our believing
subjects were baptized; that this alone should have reception
and authority with the orthodox people in all the most
holy churches of God as the only formulary of the right faith,
and sufficient for the utter destruction of all heresy and for
the complete unity of the holy churches of God; the acts of
the one hundred and fifty holy Fathers assembled in this
imperial city, in confirmation of the sacred symbol itself and
in condemnation of those who blasphemed against the Holy
Ghost, retaining their own force; as well as of all done in the
metropolitan city of the Ephesians against the impious Nestorius
and those who subsequently favored his opinions.<note place="foot">It is to be
noted that condemnation of Eutyches is not confirmed.</note> But
the proceedings which have disturbed the unity and good
order of the holy churches of God, and the peace of the whole
world, that is to say, the so-called <hi rend='italic'>Tome</hi> of Leo, and all things
done at Chalcedon in innovation upon the before-mentioned
holy symbol of the three hundred and eighteen holy Fathers,
whether by way of definition of the faith or setting forth of
symbols, or interpretation, or instruction, or discourse; we
decree that these shall be anathematized both here and everywhere
by all the most holy bishops in every church and shall
be given to the flames by whomsoever they shall be found,
<pb n='525'/><anchor id='Pg525'/>
insomuch as it was so enjoined respecting all heretical doctrines
by our predecessors of pious and blessed memory,
Constantine and Theodosius the younger [<hi rend='italic'>v. supra</hi>,
<ref target="Section_73">§ 73</ref>],
and that, having thus been rendered null, they shall be utterly
cast out from the one and only Catholic and Apostolic Orthodox
Church, as superseding the everlasting and saving definitions
of the three hundred and eighteen Fathers, and those of
the blessed Fathers who, by the Holy Ghost, decreed at Ephesus
[it is possible that there is a fault in the text here; the
expected reading of the passage would be: and of the one
hundred and fifty bishops who decreed concerning the Holy
Spirit; and of those who were assembled at Ephesus] that
no one, either of the priesthood or laity, be allowed to
deviate in any respect from that most sacred constitution
of the holy symbol, and we decree that these be anathematized
together with all the innovations upon the sacred symbol
which were made at Chalcedon and the heresy of those
who do not confess that the only begotten Son of God was
truly incarnate and made man of the Holy Ghost and of the
holy and ever-virgin Mary, Theotokos, but falsely allege that
either from heaven or in mere phantasy and seeming He took
flesh; and, in short, every heresy and whatever else at any
time in any manner or place in the whole world, in either
thought or word, has been devised as an innovation upon
and in derogation of the sacred symbol. And inasmuch as it
belongs especially to imperial providence to furnish to their
subjects, with forecasting deliberation, security not only for
the present but for the future, we decree that everywhere
the most holy bishops shall subscribe to this our sacred circular
letter when exhibited to them, and shall distinctly declare
that they submit to the sacred symbol of the three hundred
and eighteen holy Fathers alone, which the one hundred
and fifty holy Fathers confirmed, as it was also defined by the
most holy Fathers who subsequently assembled in the metropolitan
city of the Ephesians, that they should submit to the
sacred symbol of the three hundred and eighteen holy Fathers,
<pb n='526'/><anchor id='Pg526'/>
as the definition of faith, and shall anathematize everything
done at Chalcedon as an offence to the orthodox people and
utterly cast it out of the churches as an impediment to the
general happiness and our own.<note place="foot">This left the
theological situation precisely as it was after the <q>Latrocinium
Ephesinum</q> of 449.</note> Those, moreover, who after
the issuing of this our sacred letter, which we trust has been
issued according to God, in an endeavor to bring about that
unity which all desire for the holy churches of God, shall attempt
to bring forward or so much as to name the innovation
upon the faith made at Chalcedon, either in discourse,
instruction, or writing, in whatsoever manner or place—those
persons, as the cause of confusion and tumult in the
churches of God and among the whole body of our subjects,
and as enemies of God and to our safety, we command
(in accordance with the laws ordained by our predecessor
Theodosius, of blessed and pious memory, against such sorts
of evil designs, which laws are subjoined to this our sacred
circular) that, if they be bishops or clergy, they be deposed;
if monks or laymen, that they be subjected to banishment
and every mode of confiscation and the severest penalties.
For so the holy and homoousian Trinity, the Creator and
Life-giver of the universe, which has ever been adored by us
in piety, now also is served by us in the destruction of the
before-mentioned tares and the confirmation of the true and
apostolic traditions of the holy symbol, becoming favorable
and gracious both to our souls and to every one of our subjects,
shall ever aid us and preserve in peace human affairs.

<p>
Being assured that the origin and constitution, the might
and invincible shield of our sovereignty, is the only right and
true faith, which the three hundred and eighteen holy Fathers
assembled at Nicæa set forth by divine inspiration, and the
one hundred and fifty holy Fathers who in like manner met
at Constantinople, confirmed; we night and day employ
every means of prayer, of zealous care, and of laws, that the
holy Catholic and Apostolic Church of God in every place
may be multiplied, which is the incorruptible and immortal
mother of our sceptre; and that the pious laity, continuing
in peace and unanimity in respect to God, may, together with
the bishops, highly beloved of God, the most pious clergy,
the archimandrites, and monks, offer up acceptably their supplications
in behalf of our sovereignty. So long as our great
God and Saviour, Jesus Christ, who was made man and
brought forth of Mary, the holy Virgin and Theotokos, approves
and readily accepts the praise we render by concord
and our service, the power of enemies will be crushed and
swept away, and all will bend their necks to our power, which
is according to God, and peace and its blessings, kindly temperature,
abundant produce, and whatever else is beneficial
will be liberally bestowed upon men. Since, then, the irreprehensible
faith is the preserver of both ourselves and Roman
affairs, petitions have been offered to us from pious archimandrites
and hermits and other venerable persons, imploring
with tears that there be unity for the most holy churches,
<pb n='528'/><anchor id='Pg528'/>
and the parts should be joined to parts which the enemy of
all good has of old time attempted to keep apart, knowing
that, if he assails the body of the Church sound and complete,
he will be defeated. For, since it happens that of unnumbered
generations which during the lapse of so many years in time
have withdrawn from life, some have departed deprived of
the laver of regeneration, and others have been borne away
on the inevitable journey of man without having partaken of
the divine communion; and innumerable murders have also
been committed; and not only the earth, but the very air
has been filled by a multitude of blood-sheddings, who would
not pray that this state of things might be transformed into
good? For this reason we were anxious that you should know
that neither we nor the churches everywhere have ever
held or shall hold, nor are we aware of any persons who
hold, any other symbol or teaching or definition of faith or
creed than the aforementioned holy symbol of the three hundred
and eighteen holy Fathers, which the aforesaid one hundred
and fifty holy Fathers confirmed. If any person should
hold such, we regard him as an alien; for we are confident
that this symbol alone is, as we said, the preserver of our sovereignty.
And all the people desiring the saving illumination
were baptized, receiving this faith only, and this the holy
Fathers assembled at Ephesus also followed; who deposed
the impious Nestorius and those who subsequently held his
sentiments. And this Nestorius we also anathematize, together
with Eutyches and all who entertain opinions contrary
to the above-mentioned, receiving at the same time the twelve
chapters of Cyril, of holy memory, formerly archbishop of
the holy Catholic Church of the Alexandrians. We confess,
moreover, that the only begotten Son of God, himself God,
who truly became man, namely, our Lord Jesus Christ, is
consubstantial with the Father as to his godhead, and the
same consubstantial with ourselves as respects his manhood;
that having descended and become flesh of the Holy Ghost
and Mary, the Virgin and Theotokos, He is one and not two;
<pb n='529'/><anchor id='Pg529'/>
for we affirm that both His miracles and the sufferings which
He voluntarily endured in the flesh, are of one; for we do
not in any degree admit those who either make a division
or a confusion or introduce a phantom; inasmuch as His
truly sinless incarnation from the Theotokos did not produce
an addition of a son, because the Trinity continued as a
Trinity, even when one of the Trinity, God the Word, did
become incarnate. Knowing, then, that neither the holy
orthodox churches of God in all places nor the priests, highly
beloved of God, who are at their head, nor our own sovereignty,
have allowed or do allow any other symbol or definition
of faith than the before-mentioned holy teaching, we
have united ourselves thereunto without hesitation. And
these things we write, not as making an innovation upon the
faith, but to satisfy you; and every one who has held or
holds any other opinion, either at the present or at another
time, whether at Chalcedon or in any synod whatever, we
anathematize; and specially the aforementioned Nestorius
and Eutyches, and those who maintain their doctrines. Link
yourselves, therefore, to the spiritual mother, the Church, and
in her enjoy divine communion with us, according to the
aforesaid one and only definition of the faith of the three
hundred and eighteen holy Fathers. For your all-holy
mother, the Church, waits to embrace you as true children,
and longs to hear your gentle voice so long withheld. Speed
yourselves, therefore, for by so doing you will both draw
toward yourselves the favor of our Master and Saviour and
God, Jesus Christ, and be commended by our sovereignty.

<head>§ 92. The Church of Italy under the Ostrogoths and during the first Schism
between Rome and the Eastern Church</head>

<p>
The schism between New and Old Rome lasted from 484 to
517, but attempts were made on both sides to end the deplorable
situation. The two successors of Acacius were willing
<pb n='530'/><anchor id='Pg530'/>
to resume communion with Rome and restore the name of
the bishop of Rome to the diptychs, but refused to take the
names of their predecessors from the same, as required by the
latter. Gelasius (492-496), Anastasius II (496-498), and
Symmachus (498-514) held firmly but unavailingly to the
Roman contention that, before any communion was possible,
the name of Acacius must be struck from the diptychs—in
the case of the dead an act as condemnatory as excommunication
in the case of the living. Meanwhile the Roman see
boldly asserted the independence of the Church, and protested
against the action of the Emperor in setting aside the decree
of Chalcedon as usurpation and tyranny. This is most clearly
set forth by Gelasius, in his epistle to the Emperor Anastasius.
The schism finally came to an end in 519, in accordance with
the ecclesiastical policy of Justinian, and at that time the
<hi rend='italic'>Formula</hi> of Hormisdas (514-523) was accepted by the heads
of the Eastern Church by an act constituting a complete surrender
of the claims of the Orientals.
</p>

<p>
While the schism was still existing and Rome was treating
with the East upon an independent footing, the situation
in Italy was far less brilliant. The Arian king, the Ostrogoth
Theodoric (489, 493-526) ruled Italy, and the attitude
of the Roman see was far less authoritative toward the local
ruler. It was, however, a period of great importance for the
future of the Church; Boethius, Cassiodorus, Dionysius Exiguus,
and Benedict of Nursia (<hi rend='italic'>v. infra</hi>, §§
<ref target="Section_104">104</ref>, <ref target="Section_105">105</ref>) all
belong to this period and the decree of Gelasius, <hi rend='italic'>De Recipiendis
Libris</hi>, was of permanent influence upon the theological
science of the West.

After Gelasius has alluded to the circumstances in which he is writing
and excused his not writing, he mentions his natural devotion to the
Roman Emperor—being himself by birth a Roman citizen—his desire as
a Christian to share with him the right faith, and as vicar of the Apostolic
See his constant anxiety to maintain the true faith; he then proceeds:
</quote>

<p>
I beseech your piety not to regard as arrogance duty in
divine affairs. Far be it from a Roman prince, I pray, to
regard as injury truth that has been intimated to him. For,
indeed, there are, O Emperor Augustus, two by whom principally
this world is ruled: the sacred authority of the pontiffs
and the royal power. Of these the importance of the priests
is so much the greater, as even for kings of men they will have
to give an account in the divine judgment. Know, indeed,
most clement son, that although you worthily rule over the
human race, yet as a man of devotion in divine matters you
submit your neck to the prelates, and also from them you
await the matters of your salvation, and in making use of the
celestial sacraments and in administering those things you
know that you ought, as is right, to be subjected to the order
of religion rather than preside over it; know likewise that
in regard to these things you are dependent upon their
judgment and you should not bend them to your will. For
if, so far as it pertains to the order of public discipline, the
priests of religion, knowing that the imperial power has been
bestowed upon you by divine providence, obey your laws,
lest in affairs of exclusively mundane determination they
might seem to resist, with how much more gladness, I ask,
does it become you to obey them who have been assigned to
the duty of performing the divine mysteries. Just as there
is no light risk for the pontiffs to be silent about those things
which belong to the service of the divinity, so there is no
small peril (which God forbid) to those who, when they ought
to obey, refuse to do so. And if it is right that the hearts of
the faithful be submitted to all priests generally who treat
<pb n='532'/><anchor id='Pg532'/>
rightly divine things, how much more is obedience to be shown
to the prelate of that see which the highest divinity wished
to be pre-eminent over all priests and which the devotion of
the whole Church continually honors?

II. Although the one dwelling of the universal Catholic
Church spread through the world is of Christ, the holy Roman
Church, however, has been placed before the other churches
by no synodical decrees, but has obtained the primacy by
the evangelic voice of our Lord and Saviour, saying, <q>Thou
art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church,</q> etc.<note place="foot">Matt.
16:18 <hi rend='italic'>f.</hi></note>
To it was given the fellowship of the most blessed Apostle
Paul, that chosen vessel who not at a different time, as heretics
prate, but at one time and on one and the same day by
a glorious death, was crowned together with Peter in agony
in the city of Rome under the Emperor Nero. And they
equally consecrated the said holy Roman Church to Christ
and placed it over all the others in the whole world by their
presence and venerable triumph.
</p>

<p>
III. Therefore the first see of Peter the Apostle is the
Roman Church, not having any spot or wrinkle or any such
thing. The second see was consecrated at Alexandria in the
name of the blessed Peter by Mark, his disciple and the evangelist.
He himself, having been directed by the Apostle Peter
<pb n='533'/><anchor id='Pg533'/>
to Egypt, preached the word of truth and consummated a
glorious martyrdom. But as the third see of the same most
blessed Apostle Peter is held the see of Antioch, since he held
that before he came to Rome, and there the name of the new
people, the name of Christians, arose.
</p>

<p>
IV. 1. And although no other foundation can be laid than
that which has been laid, which is Christ Jesus, yet after the
writings of the Old and New Testaments,<note place="foot">The list
is given in the early part of the epistle not here given: see Preuschen,
<hi rend='italic'>loc. cit.</hi></note> which we receive
regularly, the same holy Roman Church does not prohibit
these following writings to be received for the purposes of
edification:
</p>

<p>
2. The holy synod of Nicæa, according to the three hundred
and eighteen Fathers, under the Emperor Constantine.
</p>

<p>
3. The holy synod of Ephesus, in which Nestorius was
condemned with the consent of the most blessed Pope [<hi rend='italic'>papa</hi>]
Celestine, held under Cyril, the prelate of the see of Alexandria,
and Acadius, a bishop sent from Italy.
</p>

<p>
4. The holy synod of Chalcedon, which was held under
the Emperor Marcian and Anatolius, bishop of Constantinople,
and in which Nestorius, Eutyches, and Dioscurus were
condemned.
</p>

<p>
V. 1. Likewise the works of the blessed Cæcilius Cyprianus,
martyr, and bishop of Carthage; 2. … of Gregory
the bishop of Nazianzus; 3. … of Basil, bishop of Cappadocia;
4. … of Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria; 5. …
of John [Chrysostom], bishop of Constantinople; 6. … of
Theophilus, bishop of Alexandria; 7. … of Cyril, bishop
of Alexandria; 8. … of Hilary, bishop of Poitiers; 9. …
of Ambrose, bishop of Milan; 10. … of Augustine, bishop
of Hippo; 11. … of Jerome, the presbyter; 12. … of
Prosper; 13. … likewise the Epistle of the blessed Pope Leo
to Flavian, bishop of Constantinople, against Eutyches and
other heretics; and if any one dispute even so much as an
<pb n='534'/><anchor id='Pg534'/>
iota of the text of the epistle, and will not reverently receive
it in all points, let him be anathema.
</p>

<p>
14. Likewise the works and treatises of the orthodox
Fathers are to be read, who in no respect have deviated from
the union with the holy Roman Church, nor have separated
from its faith and teaching; but, by the grace of God, have
shared in communion with it even to the last days of their life.
</p>

<p>
15. Likewise the decretal epistles which the most blessed
Popes at different times have given from the city of Rome,
in reply to consultations of various fathers, are to be reverently
received.
</p>

<p>
16. Likewise the acts of the holy martyrs.… But, according
to an ancient custom and singular caution, they are
not to be read in the holy Roman Church, because the names
of those who wrote them are not known.…
</p>

<p>
17. Likewise the lives of the fathers Paul, Antony, Hilarion,
and all hermits which the most blessed Jerome has described,
we receive in honor.
</p>

<p>
18. Likewise the acts of the blessed Sylvester, prelate of
the Apostolic See, although the name of the writer is unknown;
however, we know that it is read by many Catholics in the
city of Rome, and on account of its ancient use many
churches have copied it.
</p>

<p>
19. Likewise the writing concerning the discovery of the
cross and another concerning the discovery of the head of the
blessed John the Baptist.…
</p>

<p>
20. Rufinus, a most religious man, has published many
books on ecclesiastical affairs and has also translated several
writings. But because the venerable Jerome has criticised
him in various points for his freedom in judgment, we are of
the same opinion as we know Jerome is, and not only concerning
Rufinus but all others whom, out of zeal toward God
and devotion to the faith, Jerome has condemned.
</p>

<p>
21. Likewise several works of Origen which the blessed
Jerome does not reject we receive as to be read; the remaining
works along with their author we declare are to be rejected.
</p>

<pb n='535'/><anchor id='Pg535'/>

<p>
22. Likewise the chronicles of Eusebius of Cæsarea and
the books of his <hi rend='italic'>Ecclesiastical History</hi>, although in the first
book of his narrative he has been a little warm and afterward
he wrote one book in praise and defence of Origen, the schismatic,
yet on account of the mention of several things, which
pertain to instruction, we say that they are to that extent
not to be rejected.…
</p>

<p>
23. Likewise we approve Orosius; 24. … the works of
Sedulius; 25. … the works of Juvencus.…
</p>

<p>
VI. Other works which have been written by heretics or
schismatics the Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church in no
respect receives, and these, although they are not received
and are to be avoided by Catholics, we believe ought to be
added below.

The beginning of salvation is to preserve the rule of a correct
faith and to deviate in no respect from the constitutions
of the fathers. And because the teaching of our Lord Jesus
Christ cannot be allowed to fail, who said, <q>Thou art Peter,
and upon this rock I will build my Church,</q> etc. [Matt. 16:18],
these things which were said are proved by the effects of
things, because in the Apostolic See religion has always been
preserved without spot or blemish. Desiring in no respect to
be separated from this hope and faith, and following the
constitutions of the Fathers, we anathematize all heretics,
and especially the heretic Nestorius, who was once bishop of
the city of Constantinople, and condemned in the Council of
Ephesus by Pope Celestine and by the holy Cyril, prelate of
the city of Alexandria. Likewise we anathematize Eutyches
and Dioscurus of Alexandria, condemned in the holy synod
of Chalcedon which we follow and embrace; adding to these
Timotheus the parricide, known as Ælurus, and also his
disciple and follower Peter [Mongus], also Acacius, who remained
in the society of their communion; because he mixed
himself with their communion he deserves the same sentence
of condemnation as they; no less condemning Peter
[Fullo] of Antioch with his followers and the followers of all
<pb n='537'/><anchor id='Pg537'/>
those above named. We receive and approve, therefore, all
the universal Epistles of Pope Leo which he wrote concerning
the Christian religion. And therefore, as we have said, following
in all things the Apostolic See and approving all of its
constitutions, I trust that I may be deemed worthy to be in
the communion with you, in which as the Apostolic See declares
there is, complete and true, the totality of the Christian
religion.

<head>Period III. The Dissolution Of The Imperial State Church And The Transition To
The Middle Ages: From The Beginning Of The Sixth Century To The Latter Part Of
The Eighth</head>

<p>
The third period of the ancient Church under the Christian
Empire begins with the accession of Justin I (518-527),
and the end of the first schism between Rome and Constantinople
(519). The termination of the period is not so clearly
marked. By the middle and latter part of the eighth century,
however, the imperial Church has ceased to exist in its original
conception. The Church in the East has become, in
great part, a group of national schismatic churches under
Moslem rulers, and only the largest fragment of the Church of
the East is the State Church of the greatly reduced Eastern
empire. In the West, the imperial influence has ceased, and
the Roman see has allied its fortunes with the rising Frankish
power, and the rise of a Western empire is already foreshadowed.
</p>

<p>
In this period, the imperial ecclesiastical system, which
had begun with Constantine, found its completion in the
Cæsaropapism which was definitively established by Justinian
as the constitution of the Eastern Church. But at the
same time the Monophysite churches seceded and became
permanent national churches. The long Christological controversy
found, at least as regards Monophysitism, its settlement
on a basis derived from the revived Aristotelian philosophy;
and the mystical piety of the East, with its apparatus
<pb n='539'/><anchor id='Pg539'/>
of hierarchy and sacraments, found its characteristic expression
in the works of Dionysius the Areopagite.
</p>

<p>
While in the East the Church was assuming its permanent
form, in the West the condition of the Church was being profoundly
influenced by the completely changed political organization
of what had been the Roman Empire of the West,
but was now parcelled out among new Germanic nationalities.
The Church in the various kingdoms, in spite of its adherence
to the see of Rome as the centre of Catholic unity, came, to
no small extent, under the secular authority, and Christianity
in Ireland, in Spain, among the Franks, Anglo-Saxons, and
even among the Lombards in Italy assumed a national character,
coming largely under the control and subject to the laws
and customs of the nation. In this period were laid the foundations
of the leading ecclesiastical institutions of the Middle
Ages, as the Church, although still under the influence of antiquity,
adapted itself and its institutions to the changed
condition due to the political situation and took up its duty
of training the rude peoples that had come within its fold.
</p>

<p>
The seventh and eighth centuries saw the completion of
the revolution in the ecclesiastical situation. In the East,
in the territories in which the national churches of the Monophysites
were established, the Moslem rule protected them
from the attempts of the orthodox emperors to enforce uniformity.
The attempts made to recover their allegiance before
they succumbed to Islam had only ended in a serious
dispute within the Orthodox Church, the Monothelete controversy,
which ended in the Sixth General Council of 681.
In Italy the Arian Lombards were gradually won to the Catholic
faith, but the Roman see soon found itself embarrassed by
the too near secular authority. Accordingly, when the controversy
with the East over Iconoclasm broke out, the Roman
Church became practically independent of the Eastern imperial
authority, and in its conflict with the Lombards came
into alliance with the rising Frankish power. With this, the
transition to the Middle Ages may be said to have been completed.
<pb n='540'/><anchor id='Pg540'/>
It was, however, only the last of a series of acts
whereby the Church was severing itself from the ancient
order and coming into closer alliance with the new order in
the life of the West. Henceforth the Church, which found
its centre in the Roman see, belongs to the West, and its relations
to the East, although no formal schism had occurred,
are of continued and increasing estrangement or alienation.

<head>Chapter I. The Church In The Eastern Empire</head>

<p>
The century extending from the accession of Justin I (518-528)
to the end of the Persian wars of Heraclius (610-641),
or from 518 to 628, is the most brilliant period of the Eastern
Empire. The rise of Islam had not yet taken place, whereby
the best provinces in Asia and Africa were cut off from the
Empire. A large part of the West was recovered under
Justinian, and under Heraclius the power of Persia, the ancient
enemy of the Roman Empire, which had been a menace
since the latter part of the third century, was completely
overthrown in the most brilliant series of campaigns since the
foundation of the Roman Empire. With the death of Justin
II (565-578), the family of Justin came to an end after occupying
the throne for sixty years. But under Tiberius (578-582)
and Maurice (582-602) the policy of Justinian was continued
in all essentials in the stereotyped form known as
Byzantinism. The Church became practically a department
of the State and of the political machinery. The only limitation
upon the will of the Emperor was the determined resistance
of the Monophysites and smaller factions. Maurice was
succeeded by the rude Phocas (602-610), whom a military
revolution placed upon the throne, and who instituted a reign
of terror and blood. Upon his downfall, Heraclius (610-641)
ascended the throne.

<head>§ 93. The Age of Justinian</head>

<p>
Justinian I, the greatest of all the rulers of the Eastern Empire,
succeeded his uncle Justin I (518-527); but he had, from
the beginning of the latter's reign, exercised an ever-increasing
influence over the imperial policy, and to him can be
attributed the direction of ecclesiastical affairs from the accession
of Justin. No reign among the Eastern emperors was
more filled with important events and successful undertakings.
His first great work was the reduction of the vast mass of
Roman law to what approached a system. This was accomplished
in 534, resulting in the Digest, made up of the various
decisions and opinions of the most celebrated Roman legal
authorities, the Codex, comprising all the statute law then in
actual force and applicable to the conditions of the Empire,
and the Institutes, a revision of the excellent introductory
manual of Gaius. No body of law reduced to writing has
been more influential in the history of the world. The second
great undertaking, or series of undertakings, was the reconquest
of the West. In 533 Belisarius recovered North Africa
to the Empire by the overthrow of the Vandal kingdom. In
554 the conquest of Italy by Belisarius and Narses was completed.
Portions of Spain had also been recovered. No
Eastern Emperor ruled over a larger territory than did Justinian
at the time of his death. The third great line of work
on the part of Justinian was his regulation of ecclesiastical
and theological matters. In this he took an active personal
part. The end of the schism with the West had been brought
about under the reign of his uncle. Three controversies fill
the reign of Justinian: the Theopaschite (519-533) over the
introduction of the phrase into the Trisagion, stating that
God was crucified for us, so that the Trisagion read as follows,
<pb n='542'/><anchor id='Pg542'/>
<q>Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, who was
crucified for us, have mercy upon us</q>; the Second Origenistic
controversy (531-543) in which those elements of Origen's
teaching which had never been accepted by the Church were
condemned along with Origen himself; and the Three Chapters
controversy, 544-553, in which, as an attempt to win
back the Monophysites, which began even before the Conference
with the Severians in 533, three of the leading Antiochians
were condemned. In connection with the two last
controversies, the Fifth General Council was held A. D. 553.

<quote rend="display">
The Origenistic controversy arose in Palestine, where the learned
monks were nicknamed Origenists by the more ignorant. The abbot
St. Sabas was especially opposed to the group which had received this
name. But several, among whom the more important were Domitian
and Theodore Askidas, won the favor of Justinian and the latter
received promotion, becoming bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia.
Supported by them, struggles broke out in various places between the
Sabaites and the Origenists. Ephraem, patriarch of Antioch, in a
synodal letter thereupon condemned Origenism. The Origenists tried
in vain to win the support of John, patriarch of Constantinople. But
he turned to Justinian, who thereupon abandoned the Origenists and
issued an edict condemning Origen and his writings, and appending a
summary of the positions condemned in ten anathematisms. Text in
Denziger, nn. 203 <hi rend='italic'>f.</hi> Synods were ordered for the condemnation of
Origen, and among these was the synod under Menas, patriarch of Constantinople,
in which were issued fifteen anathematisms based upon
the ten of Justinian (Hefele, §§ 257, 258). With this action, the controversy
may be said to be closed, were it not that in spite of the renewed
condemnation at the Fifth General Council (see below) disputes and disturbances
continued in Palestine until 563.

This important document was addressed to Menas of Constantinople

detached fragments, which are given below, taken from the text as
given by Hefele, § 259. The first is given in a letter of Justinian to
the Fifth Council, an abridgment of which may be found in Hefele,

Hefele has identified with the <hi rend='italic'>Judicatum</hi>. In this opinion Krüger
(art. <q>Vigilius</q> in PRE). and Bailey (art. <q>Vigilius</q> in DCB) and other

by the Three Chapters are heretical; of the others, that the credit

fast that which is good, therefore anathematize Theodore,
who was bishop of Mopsuestia, with all his impious writings,
and also those who defend him. We anathematize also the
impious epistle which is said to have been written by Ibas
to Maris the Persian, as contrary to the right faith, and also
all who defend it and say that it is right. We anathematize
also the writings of Theodoret which were written contrary
to the right faith and against the capitula of Cyril.<note place="foot">The

3. If it had been shown conclusively by us to be contained

it is to be believed that those then present could have
investigated things diligently even apart from writing, and
have defined them positively, which appears to us after so

established which were defined in the venerable councils at
Nicæa, and Constantinople, in the first at Ephesus, and at

without doubt condemned, and those are no less absolved
whose absolution was decreed by the same synods.

5. Subjecting also him to the sentence of anathema who

<quote rend="display">
The synod known as the Fifth General Council met May 5, 553,
and proceeded to condemn the Three Chapters, as directed by the
Emperor. Vigilius refused to attend, but consented to pronounce his
judgment on the matter apart from the council. This he did in his
<hi rend='italic'>Constitutum ad Imperatorem</hi>, May 14, 553. In it he condemns the
teaching of Theodore of Mopsuestia, but opposes the condemnation
of Theodore himself, inasmuch as he had died in the communion of
the Church. He also opposes the condemnation of Theodoret and
Ibas, because both were acquitted at Chalcedon. This <hi rend='italic'>Constitutum</hi>
is to be distinguished from the <hi rend='italic'>Constitutum</hi> of 554 (MSL, 69:143,
147), in which, after the council had acceded to the proposals of the Emperor
and condemned the Three Chapters and had excommunicated
Vigilius by removing his name from the diptychs, the latter confirmed
the decisions of the council and joined in the condemnation of the Three
Chapters. For a discussion of the whole situation, see Hefele, §§ 272-276.
The devious course followed by Vigilius has been the subject of
much acrimonious debate. The facts of the case are now generally recognized.
The conclusion of Cardinal Hergenröther, KG. I, 612, is the
best that can be said for Vigilius: <q>In the question as to the faith,
Vigilius was never wavering; but he was so, indeed, in the question as
to whether the action was proper or opportune, whether it was advisable
or necessary to condemn subsequently men whom the Council of
Chalcedon had spared, to put forth a judgment which would be regarded
by the Monophysites as a triumph of their cause, which was
most obnoxious for the same reason, and its supposed dishonoring of
the Council of Chalcedon, and was likely to create new divisions instead
of healing the old.</q>

<quote rend="display">
The portions of the <hi rend='italic'>Constitutum</hi> given below are the conclusions of
Vigilius as to each of the Three Chapters. The whole is a lengthy
document.

<p>
All these things have been diligently examined, and although
our Fathers speak in different phrases yet are guided
by one sentiment, that the persons of priests, who have died
in the peace of the Church, should be preserved untouched;
likewise the constitutions of the Apostolic See, which we have
quoted above, uniformly define that it is lawful for no one
to judge anew anything concerning the persons of the dead,
<pb n='548'/><anchor id='Pg548'/>
but each is left in that condition in which the last day finds
him; and especially concerning the name of Theodore of
Mopsuestia, what our Fathers determined is clearly shown
above. Him, therefore, we dare not condemn by our sentence,
and we do not permit him to be condemned by any one else;
the above-written chapters of dogmas, which are damned by
us, or any sayings of any one without name affixed, not
agreeing with, or consonant with, the evangelical and apostolic
doctrine and the doctrines of the four synods, of Nicæa,
of Constantinople, of the first of Ephesus, and of Chalcedon,
we, however, do not suffer to be admitted to our thought or
even to our ears.
</p>

<p>
But concerning the writings which are brought forward
under the name of that venerable man, Theodoret, late
bishop, we wonder, first, why it should be necessary or with
what desire anything should be done to the disparagement
of the name of that priest, who more than a hundred years
ago, in the judgement of the sacred and venerable Council of
Chalcedon, subscribed without any hesitation and consented
with profound devotion to the Epistle of the most blessed Pope
Leo.… The truth of these things having been considered,
we determine and decree that nothing be done or proposed by
any one in judgement upon him to the injury and defamation
of a man most approved in the synod of Chalcedon, that is
to say, Theodoret of Cyrus. But guarding in all respects the
reverence of his person, whatsoever writings are brought forward
under his name or under that of another evidently in
accord with the errors of the wicked Nestorius and Eutyches
we anathematize and condemn.
</p>

<quote rend="display">
Then follow these five anathematisms, the test of which may be
found in Hahn, § 228:
</quote>

<p>
1. If any one does not confess that the Word was made
flesh, and the inconvertibility of the divine nature having been
preserved, and from the moment of conception in the womb
of the virgin united according to subsistence [hypostatically]
<pb n='549'/><anchor id='Pg549'/>
human nature to Himself, but as with a man already existing;
so that, accordingly, the holy Virgin is not to be believed to be
truly the bearer of God, but is called so only in word, let him
be anathema.
</p>

<p>
2. If any one shall deny that a unity of natures according
to subsistence [hypostatically] was made in Christ, but that
God the Word dwelt in a man existing apart as one of the
just, and does not confess the unity of natures according to
subsistence, that God the Word with the assumed flesh remained
and remains one subsistence or person, let him be
anathema.
</p>

<p>
3. If any one so divides the evangelical, apostolic words
in reference to the one Christ, that he introduces a division
of the natures united in Him, let him be anathema.
</p>

<p>
4. It any one says that the one Jesus Christ, God the
Word and the same true Son of Man, was ignorant of future
things or of the day of the last judgment, and was able to
know only so far as Deity revealed to Him, as if dwelling in
another, let him be anathema.
</p>

<p>
5. If any one applies to Christ as if stripped of His divinity
the saying of the Apostle in the Epistle to the Hebrews,<note place="foot">Heb. 5:7,
8.</note> that He knew obedience by experience and with strong crying and
tears offered prayers and supplications to God who was able
to save Him from death, and who was perfected by the labors
of virtue, so that from this he evidently introduces two
Christs or two Sons, and does not believe the one and the same
Christ to be confessed and adored Son of God and Son of
Man, of two and in two natures inseparable and undivided,
let him be anathema.

… We have also examined concerning the Epistle of the
venerable man Ibas, once bishop of the city of Edessa, concerning
which you also ask if in early times anything concerning
it was undertaken by our Fathers, or discussed, or examined,
or determined. Because it is known to all and especially to
your piety, that we are ignorant of the Greek language, yet by
<pb n='550'/><anchor id='Pg550'/>
the aid of some of our company, who have knowledge of that
tongue, we discover clearly and openly that in the same synod
the affair of the venerable man Ibas was examined, from the
action taken regarding Photius, bishop of Tyre, and Eustathius,
bishop of Berytus, that this epistle, concerning which
inquiry is made, was brought forward against him by his
accusers; and when, after discussion of the affair was ended,
it was asked of the venerable Fathers what ought to be done
concerning the matter of the same Ibas, the following sentence
was passed:
</p>

<p>
Paschasius and Lucentius, most reverend bishops, and Boniface,
presbyter, holding the place of the Apostolic See (because
the apostolic delegates are accustomed always to speak
and vote first in synods), by Paschasius said: <q>Since the documents
have been read, we perceive from the opinion of the
most reverend bishops that the most reverend Ibas is approved
as innocent; for now that his epistle has been read we
recognize it as orthodox. And on this account we decree
that the honor of the episcopate be restored to him, and the
church, from which unjustly and in his absence he was driven
out, be given back.</q> [The patriarchs of Constantinople
and Antioch agreed, and their opinions are also quoted by
Vigilius from the Acts of the Council of Chalcedon.]
</p>

<p>
… Therefore we, following in all things the discipline and
judgment of the holy Fathers, and the disposition of all
things according to the account which we have given of the
judgment of the Council of Chalcedon, since it is most evidently
true, from the words of the Epistle of the venerable
man Ibas, regarded with the right and pious mind, and from
the action taken regarding Photius and Eustathius, and from
the opinions of bishop Ibas, discussed in his presence by those
present, that our Fathers present at Chalcedon most justly
pronounced the faith of the same venerable man Ibas orthodox
and his blaming the blessed Cyril, which they perceive
to have been from error of human intelligence, purged by
appropriate satisfaction, by the authority of our present sentence,
<pb n='551'/><anchor id='Pg551'/>
we determine and decree in all things so also in the
often-mentioned Epistle of the venerable Ibas, the judgment
of the Fathers present at Chalcedon remain inviolate.

<head>§ 94. The Byzantine State Church under Justinian</head>

<p>
According to Justinian's scheme of Church government,
the Emperor was the head of the Church in the sense that he
had the right and duty of regulating by his laws the minutest
detail of worship and discipline, and also of dictating the theological
opinions to be held in the Church. This is shown, not
merely in his conduct of the Fifth General Council, but also in
his attempt, at the end of his life, to force Aphthartodocetism
upon the Church. This position of the Emperor in relation
to the Church is known as Cæsaropapism. (See Bury, <hi rend='italic'>Later
Roman Empire</hi>, chap. XI.) The ecclesiastical legislation of
Justinian should also be considered. At the same time Justinian
strictly repressed the lingering heathenism and, in the
interest of the schools at Constantinople, closed the schools
at Athens, the last stronghold of paganism.

Aphthartodocetism of Justinian.

<quote rend="display">
Among the many variations of Monophysitism flourishing under
Justinian was Aphthartodocetism, according to which the body of Christ,
before as well as after his resurrection, was <q>a glorified body,</q> or incapable
of suffering. See selection for description.
</quote>

<p>
At that time Justinian, abandoning the right road of doctrine
and following the path untrodden by the Apostles and
Fathers, became entangled in thorns and briars; and he
attempted to fill the Church also with these, but failed in his
purpose, and thereby fulfilled the prediction of prophecy.… Justinian,
after he had anathematized Origen, Didymus, and
Evagrius, issued what the Latins call an edict, after the deposition
<pb n='554'/><anchor id='Pg554'/>
of Eustochius [A. D. 556], in which he termed the body
of the Lord incorruptible and incapable of the natural and
blameless passions; affirming that the Lord ate before His
passion in the same manner as after His resurrection, His holy
body having undergone no conversion or change from the
time of its actual formation in the womb, not even in respect
to the natural and voluntary passions, nor yet after the resurrection.
To this he proceeded to compel bishops in all parts
to give their assent. However, they all professed to look to
Anastasius, the Bishop of Antioch, and thus avoided the first
attack.

Among the greatest gifts of God bestowed by the kindness
of heaven are the priesthood and the imperial dignity. Of
these the former serves things divine; the latter rules human
affairs and cares for them. Both are derived from the one
and the same source, and order human life. And, therefore,
nothing is so much a care to the emperors as the dignity of
the priesthood; so that they may always pray to God for
them. For if one is in every respect blameless and filled with
confidence toward God, and the other rightly and properly
maintains in order the commonwealth intrusted to it, there
is a certain excellent harmony which furnishes whatsoever
is needful for the human race. We, therefore, have the greatest
cares for the true doctrines of God and the dignity of the
priesthood which, if they preserve it, we trust that by it great
benefits will be bestowed by God, and we shall possess undisturbed
those things which we have, and in addition acquire
those things which we have not yet acquired. But all things
are well and properly carried on, if only a proper beginning is
laid, and one that is acceptable to God. But this we believe
will be so if the observance of the sacred canons is cared for,
which also the Apostles, who are rightly to be praised, and the

<p>
We command that all bishops and presbyters shall offer
the sacred oblation and the prayers in holy baptism not
silently, but with a voice which may be heard by the faithful
people, that thereby the minds of those listening may be moved
to greater contrition and to the glory of God. For so, indeed,
the holy Apostle teaches (I Cor. 14:16; Rom. 10:10).… Therefore
it is right that to our Lord Jesus Christ, to our
God with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be offered prayer
in the holy oblation and other prayers with the voice by the
most holy bishops and the presbyters; for the holy priests
should know that if they neglect any of those things they shall
render an account at the terrible judgment of the great God
and our Saviour Jesus Christ, and that we shall not quietly
permit such things when we know of them and will not leave
them unpunished. We command, therefore, that the governors
of the epachies, if they see anything neglected of those
things which have been decreed by us, first urge the metropolitans
and other bishops to celebrate the aforesaid synods,
and do whatsoever things we have ordered by this present law
concerning synods, and, if they see them delaying, let them
report to us, that from us may come a proper correction of
those who put off holding synods. And the governors and

Laws governing the ordination of bishops.
</quote>

<p>
We decree that whenever it is necessary to ordain a bishop,
the clergy and the leading citizens whose is the bishop who
is to be ordained shall make, under peril of their souls, with the
holy Gospels placed before them, certificates concerning three
persons, testifying in the same certificates that they have not
chosen them for any gifts or promises or for reasons of friendship,
or any other cause, but because they know that they
are of the true and Catholic faith and of honest life, and learned
in science and that none of them has either wife or children,
and know that they have neither concubine nor natural children,
but that if any of them had a wife the same was one and
first, neither a widow nor separated from her husband, nor
prohibited by the laws and sacred canons; and know that they
are not a curial or an official, or, in case they should be such,
are not liable to any curial or official duty; and they know
that they have in such case spent not less than fifteen years
in a monastery. This also is to be contained in the certificate:
that they know the person selected by them to be not
less than thirty years of age; so that from the three persons
for whom these certificates were made the best may be ordained
by the choice and at the peril of him who ordains. But
a curial or an official who, as has been said, has lived fifteen
years in a monastery and is advanced to the episcopate is
freed from his rank so that as freed from the curia he may
retain a fourth part of his property, since the rest of his property,
according to our law, is to be claimed by the curia and
fisc. Also we give to those who make the certificate the privilege
that if they deem a layman, with the exception of a
curial or an official, worthy of the said election, they may
choose such layman with the two other clergy or monks, but
so, however, that the layman who has in this way been chosen
<pb n='557'/><anchor id='Pg557'/>
to the episcopate shall not be ordained at once, but shall first
be numbered among the clergy not less than three months,
and so having learned the holy canons and the sacred ministry
of the Church, he shall be ordained bishop; for he who ought
to teach others ought not himself to be taught by others after
his consecration. But if by chance there are not found in
any place three persons eligible to such election, it is permitted
those who make the certificates to make them for two or even
for only one person, who shall each have the testimonials
mentioned by us. But if those who ought to elect a bishop
do not make this certificate within six months, then, at the
peril of his soul, let him who ought to ordain ordain a bishop,
provided, however, that all things which we have said be
observed. But if any one is made bishop contrary to the
aforesaid rules, we command that he be driven entirely from
the episcopate; but as for him who dared to ordain him against
these commands, let him be separated from the sacred ministry
for a year and all his property, which at any time or in
any way shall come into his possession, shall be seized on
account of the crime he has committed against the rule of the
Church of which he was a bishop.

Ch. 13. We do not permit clergy to be ordained unless
they are educated, have the right faith, and an honorable life,
and neither have, nor have had, a concubine or natural children,

her one and only, neither a widow not separated from her
husband, nor forbidden by laws and sacred canons.

committed, and if committed that they be punished; but if
their repression exceed provincial power, these things are to
be referred to us, that the responsibility for, and incitement
of, these crimes may not rest upon them.
</p>

<p>
(1) It is permitted no one, either in testament or by gift,
to leave or give anything to persons or places for the maintenance
of pagan impiety, even if it is not expressly contained
in the words of the will, testament, or donation, but can be
truly perceived in some other way by the judges. (2) But
those things which are so left or given shall be taken from the
persons and places to whom they have been given or left,
and shall belong to the cities in which such persons dwell or
in which such places are situated, so that they may be paid as
a form of revenue. (3) All penalties which have been introduced
by previous emperors against the errors of pagans or
in favor of the orthodox faith are to remain in force and effect
forever and guarded by this present pious legislation.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 10. Because some are found who are imbued with the
error of the impious and detestable pagans, and do those things
which move a merciful God to just wrath, and that we may
not suffer ourselves to leave uncorrected matters which concern
these things, but, knowing that they have abandoned the
worship of the true and only God, and have in insane error
offered sacrifices, and, filled with all impiety, have celebrated
solemnities, we subject those who have committed these
<pb n='559'/><anchor id='Pg559'/>
things, after they have been held worthy of holy baptism, to
the punishment appropriate to the crimes of which they have
been convicted; but for the future we decree to all by this
present law that they who have been made Christians and at
any time have been deemed worthy of the holy and saving
baptism, if it appear that they have remained still in the
error of the pagans, shall suffer capital punishment.
</p>

<p>
(1) Those who have not yet been worthy of the venerable
rite of baptism shall report themselves, if they dwell in this
royal city or in the provinces, and go to the holy churches
with their wives and children and all the household subject
to them, and be taught the true faith of Christians, so that
having been taught their former error henceforth to be rejected,
they may receive saving baptism, or know, if they
regard these things of small value, that they are to have no
part in all those things which belong to our commonwealth,
neither is it permitted them to become owners of anything
movable or immovable, but, deprived of everything, they are
to be left in poverty, and besides are subject to appropriate
penalties.
</p>

<p>
(2) We forbid also that any branch of learning be taught
by those who labor under the insanity of the impious pagans,
so that they may not for this reason pretend that they instruct
those who unfortunately resort to them, but in reality
corrupt the minds of their pupils; and let them not receive
any support from the public treasury, since they are not permitted
by the Holy Scriptures or by pragmatic forms [public
decrees] to claim anything of the sort for themselves.
</p>

<p>
(3) For if any one here or in the provinces shall have been
convicted of not having hastened to the holy churches with
his wife and children, as said, he shall suffer the aforesaid
penalties, and the fisc shall claim his property, and they shall
be sent into exile.
</p>

<p>
(4) If any one in our commonwealth, hiding himself, shall
be discovered to have celebrated sacrifices or the worship of
idols, let him suffer the same capital punishment as the Manichæans
<pb n='560'/><anchor id='Pg560'/>
and, what is the same, the Borborani [certain Ophitic
Gnostics; <hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> DCB], for we judge them to be similar to these.
</p>

<p>
(5) Also we decree that their children of tender years shall
at once and without delay receive saving baptism; but they
who have passed beyond their earliest age shall attend the
holy churches and be instructed in the Holy Scriptures, and
so give themselves to sincere penitence that, having rejected
their early error, they may receive the venerable rite of baptism,
for in this way let them steadfastly receive the true faith
of the orthodox and not again fall back into their former error.
</p>

<p>
(6) But those who, for the sake of retaining their military
rank or their dignity or their goods, shall in pretence accept
saving baptism, but have left their wives and children and
others who are in their households in the error of pagans, we
command that they be deprived of their goods and have no
part in our commonwealth, since it is manifest that they have
not received holy baptism in good faith.
</p>

<p>
(7) These things, therefore, we decree against the abominable
pagans and the Manichæans, of which Manichæans
the Borborani are a part.

<head>§ 95. The Definitive Type of Religion in the East: Dionysius the Areopagite</head>

<p>
The works of Dionysius the Areopagite first appear in the
controversies in the reign of Justinian, when they are quoted
in the Conference with the Severians, 531 or 533. There are
citations from the works of the Areopagite fifteen or twenty
years earlier in the works of Severus, the Monophysite patriarch
of Antioch. In this is given the latest date to which
they may be assigned. They cannot be earlier than 476,
because the author is acquainted with the works of Proclus
(411-485) and uses them; also he refers to the practice of
singing the Credo in divine service, which was first introduced
by the Monophysites at Antioch in 476. No closer determination
of the date is possible. The author is wholly unknown.
</p>

<pb n='561'/><anchor id='Pg561'/>

<p>
That he was Dionysius the Areopagite (Acts 17:34) is maintained
by no scholar to-day. His standpoint is that of the
later Eastern religious feeling and practice, with its strong
desire for mysteries and sacramental system. But he brings
to it Neo-Platonic thought to such a degree as to color completely
his presentation of Christian truth. The effect of
the book was only gradual, but eventually very great. In the
East it gave authority, which seemed to be that of the apostolic
age, for its highly developed system of mysteries, which
had grown up in the Church. In the West it served as a
philosophical basis for scholastic mysticism. On account of
the connection between Dionysius and the later Greek philosophy
and the mediæval philosophy, Dionysius the Areopagite
occupies a place in the histories of philosophy quite out
of proportion to the intrinsic merit of the writer.

the explanation of the Holy Scripture tells us that the most

rank, our great leader names the one, like, and only truly
first hierarchy, which is more godlike and stands more immediately
near the first effects of the illuminations of divinity

That our hierarchy … which is given by God, is God-inspired

have been initiated into the holy consecration.… Jesus,
the most divine and most transcendent spirit, the principle

holiness, and divine operation, brings to the blessed beings
superior to us a more bright and at the same time more

Him, by the love of the beautiful which draws us up to Him,
He brings together into one our many heterogeneities; that
He might perfect them so as to become a uniform and divine
life, condition, and activity, He gives us the power of the
divine priesthood. In consequence of this honor we arrive
at the holy activity of the priesthood, and so we ourselves
come near to the beings over us, that we, so far as we are
able, approximate to their abiding and unchangeable holy
state and so look up to the blessed and divine brilliancy of

6. The hierarchical order, which is filled full of the perfecting
power, performs especially the consecrations of the
hierarchy, imparts by revelation the knowledge of the sacred
things, and teaches the conditions and powers appropriate
to them. The order of priests which leads to light leads to
the divine beholding of the sacred mysteries all those who
have been initiated by the divine order of the hierarchs and
with that order performs its proper sacred functions. In
what it does it displays the divine working through the most
holy symbols [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, sacraments] and makes those who approach
beholders and participants in the most holy mysteries, sending
on to the hierarch those who desire the knowledge of those
sacred rites which are seen. The order of the liturges [or
deacons] is that which cleanses and separates the unlike

before they come to the sacred rites of the priests, purifies
those who approach that it may render them pure from all
that is opposing and unworthy of beholding and participating
in the sacred mysteries.

<head>Chapter II. The Transition To The Middle Ages. The Foundation Of The
Germanic National Churches</head>

<p>
While the doctrinal system of the Church was being wrought
out in the disputes and councils of Rome and the East, the
foundations of the Germanic national churches were being
laid in the West. In the British Isles the faith was extended
from Britain to Ireland and thence to Scotland (<ref target="Section_96">§ 96</ref>).
Among the inmates of the monasteries of these countries were many
monks who were moved to undertake missionary journeys
to various parts of Western Europe, and among them St.
<pb n='565'/><anchor id='Pg565'/>
Columbanus. But even more important for the future of
Western Christendom was the conversion of the Franks from
paganism to Catholic Christianity. At a time when the
other Germanic rulers were still Arian, Clovis and the Franks
became Catholics and, as a consequence, the champions of
the Catholic faith. The Franks rapidly became the dominant
power in the West, and soon other Germanic races either were
conquered or followed the example of the Franks and became
Catholics (<ref target="Section_97">§ 97</ref>). The State churches that thus arose were
more under the control of the local royal authority than the
Catholic Church had previously been, and the rulers were
little disposed to favor outside control of the ecclesiastical
affairs of their kingdoms (<ref target="Section_98">§ 98</ref>). Toward the end of the
sixth century the greatest pontiff of the ancient Church, Gregory
the Great, more than recovered the prestige and influence
which had been lost under Vigilius. By his able administration
he did much to unite the West, to heal the schism resulting
from the Fifth Council, and to overcome the heresies
which divided the Arians and the Catholics. At the same
time he advanced the authority of the see of Rome in the
East as well as in the West (<ref target="Section_99">§ 99</ref>). Of the many
statesman-like undertakings of Gregory none had more far-reaching
consequences than the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons and
the establishment in England of a church which would be in
close and loyal dependence upon the Roman see, and in consequence
of that close connection would be the heir of the
best traditions of culture in the West (<ref target="Section_100">§ 100</ref>).

<head>§ 96. The Celtic Church in the British Isles</head>

<p>
Christianity was probably planted in the British Isles
during the second century; as to its growth in the ante-Nicene
period little is definitely known. Representatives
of the British Church were at Arles in 314. The Church was
in close connection with the Church on the Continent during
the fourth century and in the fifth during the Pelagian controversy.
The Christianity thus established was completely
overthrown or driven into Wales by the invasion of the pagan
Angles, Jutes, and Saxons <hi rend='italic'>circa</hi> 449-500. (For the conversion
of the newcomers, <hi rend='italic'>v. infra</hi>,
<ref target="Section_100">§ 100</ref>.)
Early in the fifth century the conversion of Ireland took place by missionaries
from Britain. In this conversion St. Patrick traditionally
plays an important part.

St. Ninian and St. Columba in Scotland.

<p>
In the year of our Lord 565, when Justin the younger, the
successor of Justinian, took the government of the Roman
Empire, there came into Britain a priest and abbot, distinguished
in habit and monastic life, Columba by name, to
preach the word of God to the provinces of the northern Picts,
that is, to those who are separated from the southern parts
by steep and rugged mountains. For the southern Picts,
who had their homes within those mountains, had long before,
as is reported, forsaken the error of idolatry, and embraced
the true faith, by the preaching of the word to them by Ninian,<note place="foot">This
reference to Ninian is the most important there is; in fact, Bede is
here the chief authority for the work of this missionary.</note>
a most reverend bishop and holy man of the British nation,
who had been regularly instructed at Rome in the faith
and mysteries of the truth, whose episcopal see was named
after St. Martin, the bishop, and was famous for its church,
wherein he and many other saints rest in the body, and
which the English nation still possesses. The place belongs
to the province of Bernicia, and is commonly called Candida
Casa,<note place="foot">Whitherne, Galloway.</note>
because he there built a church of stone, which was
not usual among the Britons.
</p>

<p>
Columba came to Britain in the ninth year of the reign of
Bridius, the son of Meilochon, the very powerful king of the
Picts, and he converted by work and example that nation to
the faith of Christ; whereupon he also received the aforesaid
island [Iona] for a monastery. It is not large, but contains
about five families, according to English reckoning. His successors
<pb n='570'/><anchor id='Pg570'/>
hold it to this day, and there also he was buried,
when he was seventy-seven, about thirty-two years after he
came into Britain to preach. Before he came into Britain
he had built a noble monastery in Ireland, which from the
great number of oaks is called in the Scottish
tongue<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>I.e.</hi>, Irish tongue.</note> Dearmach,
that is, the Field of Oaks. From both of these monasteries
many others had their origin through his disciples both
in Britain and Ireland; but the island monastery where his
body lies holds the rule.
</p>

<p>
That island always has for its ruler an abbot, who is a
priest, to whose direction all the province and even bishops
themselves are subject by an unusual form of organization,
according to the example of their first teacher, who was not
a bishop, but a priest and monk; of whose life and discourses
some writings are said to have been preserved by his disciples.
But whatever he was himself, this we regard as certain concerning
him, that he left successors renowned for their great
continency, their love of God, and their monastic rules. However,
they followed uncertain cycles<note place="foot">Rules for computing Easter.</note>
in their observance of the
great festival [Easter], for no one brought them the synodal
decrees for the observance of Easter, because they were
placed so far away from the rest of the world; they only practised
such works of piety and chastity as they could learn
from the prophetical, evangelical, and apostolical writings.
This manner of keeping Easter continued among them for a
long time, that is, for the space of one hundred and fifty years,
or until the year of our Lord's incarnation 715.

<head>§ 97. The Conversion of the Franks. The Establishment
of Catholicism in the Germanic Kingdoms</head>

<p>
Chlodowech (Clovis, 481-511) was originally a king of the
Salian Franks, near Tournay. By his energy he became king
of all the Franks, and, overthrowing Syagrius in 486, pushed
his frontier to the Loire. In 496 he conquered a portion of the
<pb n='571'/><anchor id='Pg571'/>
Alemanni. About this time he became a Catholic. He had
for some time favored the Catholic religion, and with his
conversion his rule was associated with that cause in the kingdoms
subject to Arian rulers. In this way his support of
Catholicism was in line with his policy of conquest. By constant
warfare Chlodowech was able to push his frontier, in
507, to the Garonne. His death, in 511, at less than fifty
years of age, cut short only for a time the extension of the
Frankish kingdom. Under his sons, Burgundy, Thuringia,
and Bavaria were conquered. The kingdom, which had been
divided on the death of Chlodowech, was united under the
youngest son, Chlotar I (sole ruler 558-561), again divided
on his death, to be united under Chlotar II (sole ruler 613-628).
In Spain the Suevi, in the northwest, became Catholic
under Carrarich in 550. They were conquered in 585 by the
Visigoths, who in turn became Catholic in 589.

Gregory of Tours (538-593) became bishop of Tours in 573. Placed
in this way in the most important see of France, he was constantly
thrown in contact with the Merovingian royal family and had abundant
opportunity to become acquainted with the course of events at
first hand. His most important work, the <hi rend='italic'>History of the Franks</hi>, is
especially valuable from the fifth book on, as here he is on ground with
which he was personally familiar. In Book II, from which the selection
is taken, Gregory depends upon others, and must be used with caution.
</quote>

<quote rend="display">
The baptism of Chlodowech was probably the result of a long process
of deliberation, beginning probably before his marriage with
Chrotechildis, a Burgundian princess, who was a Catholic. While
still a pagan he was favorably disposed toward the Catholic Church.
About 496 he was baptized, probably on Christmas Day, at Rheims, by
St. Remigius. The place and date have been much disputed of late.
The earliest references to the conversion are by Nicetus of Trier (<hi rend='italic'>ob.
circa</hi> 566), <hi rend='italic'>Epistula ad Chlodosvindam reginam Longobardorum</hi>
(MSL, 5:375); and Avitus, <hi rend='italic'>Epistula</hi> 41, addressed to Chlodowech
himself. (MSL, 59:257). A careful examination of all the evidence may be
found in A. Hauck, <hi rend='italic'>Kirchengeschichte Deutschlands</hi>, fourth ed., I,
595 <hi rend='italic'>ff.</hi> Hauck concludes that <q>the date, December 25, 496, may be
regarded as almost certainly the date of the baptism of Chlodowech. The
connection as to time between the first war with the Alemanni and the
<pb n='572'/><anchor id='Pg572'/>
baptism may have given occasion to seek for some actual connection between
the two events.</q> The selection is therefore given as the traditional
version and is not to be relied upon as correct in detail. It
represents what was probably the current belief within a few decades
of the event.
</quote>

<p>
Ch. 30. The queen (Chrotechildis) ceased not to warn Chlodowech
that he should acknowledge the true God and forsake
idols. But in no way could he be brought to believe these
things. Finally war broke out with the Alemanni. Then by
necessity was he compelled to acknowledge what before he had
denied with his will. The two armies met and there was a
fearful slaughter, and the army of Chlodowech was on the
point of being annihilated. When the king perceived that,
he raised his eyes to heaven, his heart was smitten and he
was moved to tears, and he said: <q>Jesus Christ, whom Chrotechildis
declares to be the Son of the living God, who says that
Thou wilt help those in need and give victory to those who
hope in Thee, humbly I flee to Thee for Thy mighty aid, that
Thou wilt give me victory over these my enemies, and I will
in this way experience Thy power, which the people called
by Thy name claim that they have proved to be in Thee.
Then will I believe on Thee and be baptized in Thy name.
For I have called upon my gods but, as I have seen, they are
far from my help. Therefore, I believe that they have no
power who do not hasten to aid those obedient to them. I
now call upon Thee and I desire to believe on Thee. Only
save me from the hand of my adversaries.</q> As he thus
spoke, the Alemanni turned their backs and began to take
flight. But when they saw that their king was dead, they
submitted to Chlodowech and said: <q>Let not, we pray thee,
a nation perish; now we are thine.</q> Thereupon he put an
end to the war, exhorted the people, and returned home in
peace. He told the queen how by calling upon the name of
Christ he had obtained victory. This happened in the fifteenth
year of his reign (496).
</p>

<p>
Ch. 31. Thereupon the queen commanded that the holy Remigius,
<pb n='573'/><anchor id='Pg573'/>
bishop of Rheims, be brought secretly to teach the king
the word of salvation. The priest was brought to him secretly
and began to lay before him that he should believe in the true
God, the creator of heaven and earth, and forsake idols, who
could neither help him nor others. But he replied: <q>Gladly
do I listen to thee, most holy Father, but one thing remains,
for the people who follow me suffer me not to forsake their
gods. But I will go and speak to them according to thy
words.</q> When he met his men, and before he began to speak,
all the people cried out together, for the divine power had
anticipated him: <q>We reject the mortal gods, pious king, and
we are ready to follow the immortal God whom Remigius
preaches.</q> These things were reported to the bishop, who
rejoiced greatly and commanded the font to be prepared.… The
king first asked to be baptized by the pontiff. He
went, a new Constantine, into the font to be washed clean
from the old leprosy, and to purify himself in fresh water
from the stains which he had long had. But as he stepped
into the baptismal water, the saint of God began in moving
tone: <q>Bend softly thy head, Sicamber, reverence what thou
hast burnt, and burn what thou hast reverenced.</q>…
</p>

<p>
Therefore the king confessed Almighty God in Trinity, and
was baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
the Holy Ghost, and was anointed with the holy chrism with
the sign of the cross. Of his army more than three thousand
were baptized. Also his sister Albofledis was baptized.… And
another sister of the king, Lanthechildis by name, who had
fallen into the heresy of the Arians, was converted, and when
she had confessed that the Son and the Holy Ghost were of
the same substance with the Father, she was given the chrism.

Ch. 35. When Alarich, the king of the Goths, saw that

<pb n='574'/><anchor id='Pg574'/>
messengers to him saying: <q>If my brother wishes, it is also
in my heart that we see each other, if God will.</q> Chlodowech
was not opposed to this and came to him. They met

in the territory of Tours, and spake and ate and drank together,
promised mutual friendship, and parted in peace.

<p>
Ch. 36. But already many Gauls wished with all their
heart to have the Franks for their masters. It therefore happened
that Quintianus, bishop of Rhodez, was driven out of
his city on account of this. For they said to him: <q>You wish
that the rule of the Franks possessed this land.</q> And a few
days after, when a dispute had arisen between him and the
citizens, the rumor reached the Goths who dwelt in the city,
for the citizens asserted that he wished to be subject to the
rule of the Franks; and they took counsel and planned how
they might kill him with the sword. When this was reported
to the man of God, he rose by night, and with the most faithful
of his servants left Rhodez and came to Arverne.…
</p>

<p>
Ch. 37. Thereupon King Chlodowech said to his men:
<q>It is a great grief to me that these Arians possess a part of
Gaul. Let us go forth with God's aid, conquer them, and
bring this land into our power.</q> And since this speech
pleased all, he marched with his army toward Poitiers, for
there dwelt Alarich at that time.… King Chlodowech met
the king of the Goths, Alarich, in the Campus Vocladensis
[Vouillé or Voulon-sur-Clain] ten miles from Poitiers; and
while the latter fought from afar, the former withstood in hand
to hand combat. But since the Goths, in their fashion, took
to flight, King Chlodowech at length with God's aid won
the victory. He had on his side a son of Sigbert the Lame,
whose name was Chloderich. The same Sigbert, ever since
he fought with the Alemanni near Zulpich [in 496], had
been wounded in the knee and limped. The king killed King
Alarich and put the Goths to flight.… From this battle
Amalrich, Alarich's son, fled to Spain, and by his ability
obtained his father's kingdom. Chlodowech, however, sent
<pb n='575'/><anchor id='Pg575'/>
his son Theuderic to Albi, Rhodez, and Arverne, and departing
he subjugated those cities, from the borders of the
Goths to the borders of the Burgundians, to the rule of his
father. But Alarich reigned twenty-two years.
</p>

<p>
Chlodowech spent the winter in Bourdeaux, and carried
away the entire treasure of Alarich from Toulouse, and he
went to Angoulême. Such favor did the Lord show him that,
when he looked on the walls, they fell of themselves. Thereupon
when the Goths had been driven from the city he
brought it under his rule. After the accomplishment of these
victories he returned to Tours and dedicated many gifts to
the holy Church of St. Martin.

<p>
Ch. 38. At that time he received from the Emperor Anastasius
the title of consul, and in the Church of St. Martin he
assumed the purple cloak and put on his head a diadem. He
then mounted a horse and with his own hand scattered among

<hi rend='italic'>Acts</hi>. Mansi, IX, 992.</head>

<quote rend="display">
This council is the most important event in the history of the Visigothic
Church of Spain, marking the abandonment of Arianism by
the ruling race of Spain and the formal acceptance of the doctrine of
the Trinity or the Catholic faith and unity. The Suevi had accepted
Catholicism more than thirty-five years before; see Synod of Braga,
A. D. 563, in Hefele, § 285 (<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> also Hahn, § 176, who
gives the text of the anathematisms in which, after a statement of the Catholic doctrine
of the Trinity, the balance of the anathematisms are concerned with
Priscillianism). Reccared, the Visigothic king (586-601), became a
Catholic in 587, and held the council of 589 to effect the conversion of
the nation to his new faith. For a letter of Gregory the Great on the
conversion of Reccared, see PNF, ser. II, vol. XII, pt. 2. p. 87, and
two from Gregory to Reccared himself (<hi rend='italic'>ibid.</hi>, vol. XIII, pp.
16, 35). The creed, as professed at Toledo, is the first instance of the authorized
use of the term "and the Son" in a creed in connection with the doctrine

of the <q>procession of the Holy Spirit,</q> the form in which the so-called

I judge that you are not ignorant, most reverend priests
[<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, bishops] that I have called you into our presence for the
restoration of ecclesiastical discipline; and because in time
past the existence of heresy prevented throughout the entire
Catholic Church the transaction of synodical business. God,
who has been pleased by our action to remove the obstacle
of the same heresy, warns us to set in order the ecclesiastical
laws concerning church matters. Therefore let it be a matter

<head>II. From the Statement of Faith.</head>

<p>
There is present here all the famous nation of the Goths,
esteemed for their real bravery by nearly all nations, who,
however, by the error of their teachers have been separated
from the faith and unity of the Catholic Church; but now,
agreeing as a whole with me in my assent to the faith, participate
in the communion of that Church which receives in its
maternal bosom a multitude of different nations and nourishes
them with the breasts of charity. Concerning her the
prophet foretelling said: <q>My house shall be called the house
of prayer for all nations.</q> For not only does the conversion
of the Goths add to the amount of our reward, but also an
infinite multitude of the people of the Suevi, whom under the
protection of Heaven we have subjected to our kingdom, led
away into heresy by the fault of an alien,<note place="foot">In
465, under the influence of the Visigoths, the Suevi, formerly Catholic,
had embraced Arianism.</note> we have endeavored
to recall to the source of truth. Therefore, most holy
Fathers, I offer as by your hands to the eternal God,
<pb n='577'/><anchor id='Pg577'/>
as a holy and pleasing offering, these most noble nations,
who have been attached by us to the Lord's possessions.
For it will be to me in the day of the retribution of the
just an unfading crown and joy if these peoples, who now by
our planning have returned to the unity of the Church, remain
founded and established in the same. For as by the
divine determination it has been a matter of our care to bring
these peoples to the unity of the Church of Christ, so it is a
matter of your teaching to instruct them in the Catholic
dogmas, by which they may be instructed in the full knowledge
of the truth, that they may know how to reject totally
the errors of pernicious heresy, to remain in charity in the
ways of the true faith, and to embrace with fervent desire the
communion of the Catholic Church.… As it is of benefit
to us to profess with the mouth what we believe in the heart …
therefore I anathematize Arius with all his doctrines …
so I hold in honor, to the praise and honor and glory of God,
the faith of the holy Council of Nicæa.… I embrace and
hold the faith of the one hundred and fifty Fathers assembled
at Constantinople.… I believe the faith of the first Council
of Ephesus … likewise with all the Catholic Church I
reverently receive the faith of the Council of Chalcedon.…
To this my confession I have added the holy constitutions
[<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, confessions of faith] of the above-mentioned councils,
and I have subscribed with complete singleness of heart to
the divine testimony.

<p>
Canon 1. After the damnation of the heresy of Arius and
the exposition of the Catholic faith, this holy council ordered
that, because in the midst of many heretics and heathen
throughout the churches of Spain, the canonical order has
been necessarily neglected (for while liberty of transgressing
abounded, and the desirable discipline was denied, and every
one fostered excesses of heresy in the protection and continuation
of evil times, a strict discipline was far off, but now
the peace of the Church has been restored by the mercy
of Christ), everything which by the authority of early canons
may be forbidden is forbidden, discipline arising again, and
everything is required which they order done. Let the constitutions
of all the councils remain in their force, likewise
all the synodical letters of the holy Roman prelates. Henceforth
let no one aspire unworthily to ecclesiastical promotions
and honors against the canons. Let nothing be done which the
holy Fathers, filled with the Spirit of God, decreed should not
be done. And let those who presume to violate the laws be
restrained by the severity of the earlier canons.
</p>

<p>
Canon 2. Out of reverence for the most holy faith and to
strengthen the weak minds of men, acting upon the advice of
the most pious and glorious King Reccared<note place="foot"><q>Let all
the churches of Spain and Gallicia observe this rule, that at every
time of offering of the sacrifice and before the communion of the body and
blood of Christ, according to the custom of the Oriental parts, all should repeat
together with a clear voice the most sacred symbol of the faith, that first the
people may speak the faith which they hold, and they may bring hearts purified
by faith to the reception of the body and blood of Christ. For so long as this
constitution be perpetually observed in the Church of God, the entire belief
of the faithful will be confirmed, and the false faith of the infidels be confuted, in
order that one may be very easily inclined to believe what one hears very often
repeated, neither shall any one excuse himself from all blame by pleading ignorance
of the faith, when he knows from the mouth of all what the Catholic
Church holds and believes.</q> (From the Speech of Reccared,
<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Mansi, <hi rend='italic'>loc. cit.</hi>)</note>
the synod has ordered that throughout the churches of Spain, Gaul, and
Gallicia, the symbol of the faith be recited according to the
form of the Oriental churches, the symbol of the Council of
Constantinople, that is, of the one hundred and fifty bishops;
<pb n='579'/><anchor id='Pg579'/>
and before the Lord's prayer is said, let it be pronounced to
the people in a clear voice, by which also the true faith may
have a manifest testimony, and the hearts of the people may
approach to the reception of the body and blood of Christ
with hearts purified by faith.

<head>§ 98. The State Church in the Germanic Kingdoms</head>

<p>
So long as the Germanic rulers remained Arian, the Catholic
Church in their kingdoms was left for the most part alone or
hindered in its synodical activity. But as the kingdoms became
Catholic on the conversion of their kings, the rulers
were necessarily brought into close official relations with the
Church and its administration; and they exercised a strict
control over the ecclesiastical councils and the episcopal elections.
The Merovingians, on their conversion from paganism,
at once became Catholics, and they consequently assumed this
control immediately. With the extension of the Frankish
kingdom, the authority of the king in ecclesiastical affairs
was likewise extended. In Spain the Visigoths were Arians
until 589. On the conversion of the nation at that date, the
king at once assumed an extensive ecclesiastical authority
(for Reccared's confirmation of the Third Synod of Toledo,
589, see Bruns, I, 393), and in the development of the system
the councils of Toledo became at once the parliaments of the
entire nation, now united through its common faith, and the
synods of the Church. This system was cut short by the
Moslem invasion of 711, and the development of the Church
and its relation to the State is to be studied in the Frankish
kingdom in which from this time the ecclesiastical development
of Western Europe is to be traced. The best evidence
for the legal state of the Church under the Germanic rulers is
chiefly in the acts of councils.
</p>

<p>
But there was also in the Catholic Church in the Germanic
kingdoms a strong monastic spirit which was by no means
willing to see the Church become an <q>establishment.</q> This
<pb n='580'/><anchor id='Pg580'/>
fitted in poorly with the condition of the State Church. It
is illustrated by the career of St. Columbanus.

why has our command been disregarded?</q> They answered
him: <q>We have indeed asked him, but he would not come.</q>
And as they said this suddenly the priest Cato appeared and

Arverne.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>I.e.</hi>,

be consecrated bishop of Tours, but, as I hear, you have despised
that church; therefore you shall be withheld from the

considerable group of monastic houses. He came into conflict with
the Frankish clergy on account of the Celtic mode of fixing the date of
Easter [see Epistle of Columbanus among the Epistles of Gregory the

Columbanus sets forth.
</quote>

<p>
Ch. 9. Columbanus gathered such treasures of divine knowledge
that even in his youth he could expound the Psalter in
polished discourse and could make many other discourses,
worthy of being sung and useful to teach. Thereupon he
took pains to be received into the company of monks, and
sought the monastery of Benechor [in Ulster] the head of
which, the blessed Commogellus, was famous for his many
virtues. He was an excellent father of his monks and highly
regarded because of his zeal in religion and the maintenance of
discipline according to the rule. And here he began to give
himself entirely to prayer and fasting and to bear the yoke of
Christ, easy to those who bear it, by denying himself and
taking up his cross and following Christ, that he, who was to
be the teacher of others, might himself learn by teaching, and
by mortification to endure in his own body what he should
abundantly show forth; and he who should teach what by others
ought to be fulfilled, himself first fulfilled. When many years
had passed for him in the cloister, he began to desire to wander
forth, mindful of the command which the Lord gave
Abraham: <q>Get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred
and from thy father's house unto a land that I will
show thee</q> [Gen. 12:1]. He confessed to Commogellus, the
venerable Father, the warm desire of his heart, the desire enkindled
by the fire of the Lord [Luke 12:49]; but he received
no such answer as he wished. For it was a grief to Commogellus
to bear the loss of a man so full of comfort. Finally
Commogellus began to take courage and place it before his
heart that he ought to seek more to advance the benefit of
others than to pursue his own needs. It happened not without
the will of the Almighty, who had trained His pupil for
<pb n='587'/><anchor id='Pg587'/>
future wars, that from his victories he might obtain glorious
triumphs and gain joyful victories over the phalanxes of slain
enemies. The abbot called Columbanus unto him and said
that though it was a grief to him yet he had come to a decision
useful to others, that he would remain in peace with
him, would strengthen him with consolation, and give him
companions for his journey men who were known for their
religion.…
</p>

<p>
So Columbanus in the twentieth<note place="foot">Rather the thirtieth
according to some MSS., which seems to be more in
accord with what has gone before.</note> year of his life set forth,
and with twelve companions under the leadership of Christ
went down to the shore of the sea. Here they waited the
grace of Almighty God that he would prosper their undertaking,
if it took place with His consent; and they perceived that
the will of the merciful Judge was with them. They embarked
and began the dangerous journey through the straits, and
crossed a smooth sea with a favorable wind, and after a quick

Columbanus founds monasteries in Gaul.
</quote>

<p>
Ch. 12. At that time there was a wide desert called Vosagus
[the Vosges] in which there lay a castle long since in ruins.
And ancient tradition called it Anagrates [Anegray]. When
the holy man reached this place, in spite of its wild isolation,
its rudeness, and the rocks, he settled there with his companions,
content with meagre support, mindful of the saying
that man lives not by bread alone, but, satisfied with the
Word of Life, he would have abundance and never hunger
again unto eternity.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 17. When the number of the monks had increased rapidly,
he began to think of seeking in the same desert for a
better place, where he might found a monastery. And he
found a place, which had formerly been strongly fortified, at
a distance from the first place about eight miles, and which
was called in ancient times Luxovium.<note place="foot">Luxeuil.</note>
Here there were
<pb n='588'/><anchor id='Pg588'/>
warm baths erected with special art. A multitude of stone
idols stood here in the near-by forest, which in the old heathen
times had been honored with execrable practices and profane
rites. Residing here, therefore, the excellent man began to
found a cloister. On hearing of this the people came to him
from all sides in order to dedicate themselves to the practice
of religion, so that the great crowd of monks gathered together
could hardly be contained in the company of one monastery.
Here the children of nobles pressed to come, that, despising
the scorned adornments of the world and the pomp of present
wealth, they might receive eternal rewards. When
Columbanus perceived this and that from all sides the people
came together for the medicines of penance, and that the
walls of one monastery could not without difficulty hold so
great a body of converts to the religious life, and although
they were of one mind and one heart, yet it was ill fitted to
the intercourse of so great a multitude, he sought out another
place, which was excellent on account of its abundance of
water, and founded a second monastery, which he named
Fontanæ,<note place="foot">Fontenay or Fontaines.</note>
and placed rulers over it, of whose piety none doubted.
As he now settled companies of monks in this place, he dwelt
alternately in each and, filled with the Holy Ghost, he established
a rule which they should observe that the prudent
reader or hearer of it might know by what sort of discipline
a man might become holy.

The quarrel of Columbanus with the Court.
</quote>

<p>
Ch. 32. It happened one day that the holy Columbanus
came to Brunichildis, who was at that time in
Brocariaca.<note place="foot">Near Autun.</note>
When she saw him coming to the court she led to the man of
God the sons of Theuderich, whom he had begotten in adultery.
He asked as he saw them what they wanted of him, and
Brunichildis said: <q>They are the king's sons; strengthen
them with thy blessing.</q> But he answered: <q>Know then that
these will never hold the royal sceptre, for they have sprung
<pb n='589'/><anchor id='Pg589'/>
from unchastity.</q> In furious anger she commanded the
boys to depart. The man of God thereupon left the royal
court, and when he had crossed the threshold there arose a
loud roar so that the whole house shook, and all shuddered
for fear; yet the rage of the miserable woman could not be restrained.
Thereupon she began to plot against the neighboring
monasteries, and she caused a decree to be issued that the
monks should not be allowed to move freely outside the land
of the monastery, and that no one should give them any support
or otherwise assist them with offerings.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 33. Against Columbanus Brunichildis excited the mind
of the king and endeavored to disturb him; and she encouraged
the minds of his princes, his courtiers, and great men to
set the mind of the king against the man of God, and she
began to urge the bishops that by vilifying the religion of
Columbanus they might dishonor the rule he had given his
monks to observe.…

there were many advantages, being uncommonly fruitful and

river in the neighborhood was called Trebia, on which

restored with all possible diligence the already half-ruined
church in all its former beauty. The roof and the top of the
temple and the ruins of the walls he repaired and set to work
to construct other things necessary for a monastery.

<head>§ 99. Gregory the Great and the Roman Church in the Second Half of the
Sixth Century</head>

<p>
Gregory the Great was born about 540. In 573 he was appointed
prefect of the city of Rome, but resigned the following
year to become a monk. Having been ordained deacon,
he was sent in 579 to Constantinople as papal apocrisiarius, or
resident ambassador at the court of the Emperor. In 586 he
was back in Rome and abbot of St. Andrew's, and in 590 he
was elected Pope. As Pope his career was even more brilliant.
He reorganized the papal finances, carried through important
disciplinary measures, and advanced the cause of monasticism.
His work as the organizer of missions in England, his
labors to heal the Istrian schism, his relations with the Lombards,
his dealings with the Church in Gaul, his controversy
with Constantinople in the matter of the title <q>Ecumenical
Patriarch,</q> and other large relations and tasks indicate the
range of his interests and the extent of his activities. As a
theologian Gregory interpreted Augustine for the Middle
Ages and was the most important and influential theologian
of the West after Augustine and before the greater scholastics.
He did much to restore the prestige of his see, which had been
lost in the earlier part of the sixth century. He died 604.

The following letter was written in 595 in reply to a letter from

</quote>

<p>
As to thy having asked therein [in a letter of Vigilius to
Gregory] according to ancient custom for the use of the pallium
and the vicariate of the Apostolic See, far be it from me
to suspect that thou hast sought eminence of transitory
power, or the adornment of external worship, in our vicariate
and the pallium. But, since it is known to all whence the
holy faith proceeded in the regions of Gaul, when your fraternity
asks for a repetition of the early custom of the Apostolic
See, what is it but that a good offspring reverts to the
bosom of its mother? With willing mind therefore we grant
what has been requested, lest we should seem either to withhold
from you anything of the honor due to you, or to
despise the petition of our most excellent son, King Childebert.…
</p>

<p>
I have learned from certain persons informing me that in the
parts of Gaul and Germany no one attains to holy orders
except for a consideration given. If this is so, I say it with
<pb n='592'/><anchor id='Pg592'/>
tears, I declare it with groans, that, when the priestly order
has fallen inwardly, neither will it be able to stand outwardly
for long.…
</p>

<p>
Another very detestable thing has also been reported to
us, that some persons being laymen, through the desire of
temporal glory, are tonsured on the death of bishops, and all
at once are made priests.…
</p>

<p>
On this account your fraternity must needs take care to
admonish our most excellent son, King Childebert, that he
remove entirely the stain of this sin from his kingdom, to the
end that Almighty God may give him so much the greater
recompense with himself as He sees him both love what He
loves and shun what He hates.
</p>

<p>
And so we commit to your fraternity, according to ancient
custom, under God, our vicariate in the churches which are
under the dominion of our most excellent son Childebert, with
the understanding that their proper dignity, according to
primitive usage, be preserved to the several metropolitans.
We have also sent a pallium which thy fraternity will use
within the Church for the solemnization of mass only. Further,
if any of the bishops should by any chance wish to travel
to any considerable distance, let it not be lawful for him to
remove to other places without the authority of thy holiness.
If any question of faith, or it may be relating to other matters,
should have arisen among the bishops, which cannot easily be
settled, let it be ventilated and decided in an assembly of
twelve bishops. But if it cannot be decided after the truth
has been investigated, let it be referred to our judgment.

</quote>

<quote rend="display">
The controversy over the title <q>Ecumenical Patriarch</q> was a result
of Gregory's determination to carry through, as far as possible, the
Petrine rights and duties as he conceived them. The title was probably
<pb n='593'/><anchor id='Pg593'/>
intended to mark the superiority of Constantinople to the other
patriarchates in the East, according to the Eastern principle that the
political rank of a city determined its ecclesiastical rank. It seemed
to Gregory to imply a position of superiority to the see of Peter. As
it certainly might imply that, he consistently opposed it. But it had
been a title in use for nearly a century. (<hi rend='italic'>Cf.</hi>
Gieseler, KG, Eng. trans.,

(Cod. I, 1, 7). For the difference in point of view between the

<p>
At the time when your fraternity was advanced in sacerdotal
dignity, you recall what peace and concord of the
churches you found. But, with what daring or with what
swelling of pride I know not, you have attempted to seize
upon a new name for yourself, whereby the hearts of all
your brethren would be offended. I wonder exceedingly at
this, since I remember that in order not to attain to the
episcopal office thou wouldest have fled. But now that thou
hast attained unto it, thou desirest so to exercise it as if
thou hadst run after it with ambitious desire. And thou who
didst confess thyself unworthy to be called a bishop, hast at
length been brought to such a pitch that, despising thy brethren,
thou desirest to be named the only bishop. And in
regard to this matter, weighty letters were sent to thy
holiness by my predecessor Pelagius, of holy memory, and in
them he annulled the acts of the synod,<note place="foot">Evagrius,
<hi rend='italic'>Hist. Ec.</hi>, VI. 7.</note> which had been assembled
among you in the case of our former brother and
fellow priest, Gregory, because of that execrable title of pride,
and forbade the archdeacon whom he sent according to
custom to the feet of our
Lord<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>I.e.</hi>, to be
the apocrisiarius at the court of the Emperor.</note>
to celebrate the solemnities
of the mass with thee. But after his death, when I, an unworthy
man, succeeded to the government of the Church, I
took care, formerly through thy representatives, and now
through our common son and deacon, Sabianus, to address thy
fraternity, not indeed in writing, but by word of mouth, desiring
thee to refrain thyself from such presumption; and in
<pb n='594'/><anchor id='Pg594'/>
case thou wouldest not amend I forbade his celebrating the
solemnities of the mass with thee; that so I might appeal to
thy holiness through a certain sense of shame, and then, if
the execrable and profane assumption could not be corrected
through shame, I might resort to canonical and prescribed
measures. And because sores that are to be cut away should
first be stroked with a gentle hand, I beg of thee, I beseech
thee, and, as kindly as I can, I demand of thee that thy fraternity
rebuke all who flatter thee and offer thee this name of
error, and not consent to be called by a foolish and proud
title. For truly I say it weeping, and out of deepest sorrow of
heart attribute it to my sins, that this my brother, who has
been placed in the episcopal order, that he might bring back
the souls of others to humility, has, up to the present time,
been incapable of being brought back to humility; that he
who teaches truth to others has not consented to teach himself,
even when I implore him.
</p>

<p>
Consider, I pray thee, that by this rash presumption the
peace of the whole Church is disturbed, and that it is in contradiction
to the grace poured out on all in common; in which
grace thou thyself wilt be able to grow so far as thou thyself
wilt determine to do so. And thou wilt become by so much
the greater as thou restrainest thyself from the usurpation of
proud and foolish titles; and thou wilt advance in proportion
as thou art not bent on arrogation by the humiliation of thy
brethren.… Certainly Peter, the first of the Apostles, was
a member of the holy and universal Church; Paul, Andrew,
John—what are they but the heads of particular communities?
And yet all are members under one Head. And to bind all
together in a short phrase, the saints before the Law, the
saints under the Law, the saints under grace, all these making
up the Lord's body were constituted as members of the
Church, and not one of them has ever wished himself to be
called <q>universal.</q>…
</p>

<p>
Is it not the fact, as your fraternity knows, that the prelates
of this Apostolic See, which by the providence of God I
<pb n='595'/><anchor id='Pg595'/>
serve, had the honor offered them by the venerable Council of
Chalcedon of being called <q>universal</q>?<note place="foot">See
Gieseler, KG, Eng. trans. I, p. 396, n. 72.</note> But yet not one
of them has ever wished to be called by such a title, or
seized upon this rash name, lest, if in virtue of the rank of
the pontificate, he took to himself the glory of singularity, he
might seem to have denied it to all his brethren.

Epistle to Phocas congratulating him on his accession.
</quote>

<quote rend="display">
Phocas (602-610) was a low-born, ignorant centurion whom chance
had placed at the head of a successful rebellion originating in the army
of the Danube. The rebellion was successful, and the Emperor Maurice
was murdered, together with his sons. Maurice had been unsuccessful
in war, unpopular with the army, and his financial measures
had been oppressive. Phocas was utterly incompetent as a ruler,
licentious and sanguinary as a man. His reign was a period of horror
and blood.
</quote>

<p>
Gregory to Phocas. Glory to God in the highest, who, according
as it is written, changes times, and transfers kingdoms,
because He has made apparent to all what He has vouchsafed
to speak by His prophet, that the most High ruleth in the kingdom
of men, and giveth it to whomsoever He will [Dan.
4:17]. For in the incomprehensible dispensation of Almighty
God there is an alternating control of human life, and sometimes,
when the sins of many are to be smitten, one is raised
up through whose hardness the necks of subjects may be
bowed down under the yoke of tribulation, as in our affliction
we have long had proof. But sometimes, when the merciful
God has decreed to refresh with His consolation the mourning
hearts of many, He advances one to the summit of government,
and through the bowels of His mercy infuses in the
minds of all the grace of exultation in Him. In which abundance
of exultation we believe that we, who rejoice that the
benignity of your piety has arrived at imperial supremacy,
shall speedily be confirmed. <q>Let the heavens rejoice and let
the earth be glad</q> [Psalm 96:11], and let the whole people
<pb n='596'/><anchor id='Pg596'/>
of the republic, hitherto afflicted exceedingly, grow cheerful
for your benignant deeds. Let the proud minds of enemies
be subdued to the yoke of your domination. Let the sad and
depressed spirit of subjects be relieved by your mercy. Let
the power of heavenly grace make you terrible to your enemies;
let piety make you kind to your subjects. Let the
whole republic have rest in your most happy times, since the
pillage of peace under the color of legal processes has been
exposed. Let plottings about testaments cease, and benevolences
extorted by violence end. Let secure possession of
their own goods return to all, that they may rejoice in possessing
without fear what they have acquired without fraud.
Let every single person's liberty be now at length restored
to each one under the yoke of the holy Empire. For there is
this difference between the kings of the nations and the emperors
of the republic: the kings of the nations are lords of
slaves, but the emperors lords of free men. But we shall
better speak of these things by praying than by putting you
in mind of them. May Almighty God keep the heart of your
piety in the hand of His grace in every thought and deed.
Whatsoever things should be done justly, whatever things
with clemency, may the Holy Ghost, who dwells in your
breast direct, that your clemency may both be exalted in a
temporal kingdom and after the course of many years attain
to heavenly kingdoms. Given in the month June, indiction six.

<head>3. Gregory and the Schism in North Italy.</head>

<quote rend="display">
Among the results of the Fifth General Council of Constantinople,
553, was a wide-spread schism in the northern part of Italy and adjacent
lands. The bishops of the western part of Lombardy, under the lead
of the bishop of Milan, together with the bishops of Venetia, Istria,
and a portion of Illyricum, Rhætia Secunda, and Noricum, under the
bishop of Aquileia, renounced communion with the see of Rome, and
became autocephalic. Even bishops in Tuscany abandoned communion
with the see of Rome because the council and Vigilius had
condemned Theodore, Theodoret, and Ibas (<hi rend='italic'>v. supra</hi>,
<ref target="Section_93">§ 93</ref>). Justin II attempted to heal the
schism, and his verbose edict may be found
<pb n='597'/><anchor id='Pg597'/>
in Evagrius, <hi rend='italic'>Hist. Ec.</hi>, V, 4.
A serious problem was presented to the
Roman see. In dealing with them, however, it was possible to treat
each group separately. On account of the Lombard invasion the
bishop of Aquileia removed his see to Grado. Gregory the Great had
some success in drawing the schismatics into more friendly relations.
But not till 612 was the see of Aquileia-Grado in communion with Rome.
A rival bishop was elected, who removed his see to old Aquileia. See
extract from Paulus Diaconus
(<hi rend='italic'><ref target="Section_99_f">f</ref></hi>).
And the opposition was maintained
until about 700. The Milanese portion of the schism had long
since ended. Of Gregory's epistles several bearing on the schism are
available in PNF, ser. II, vols. XII and XIII: Reg. I, 16; II, 46,

son, the deacon Boniface, has given me information from a
private letter of thy fraternity: namely, that three bishops,
having sought out rather than having found an occasion, have
separated themselves from the pious communion of thy fraternity,
saying that thou hast assented to the condemnation
of the three chapters and hast given a solemn pledge.
And, indeed, whether there has been any mention made of the
three chapters in any word or writing whatever, thy fraternity
remembers well; although thy fraternity's predecessor,
Laurentius (<hi rend='italic'>circa</hi> 573), did send a most strict security to the
Apostolic See, and to it a legal number of the most noble men
subscribed; among whom, I also, at that time holding the
prætorship of the city, likewise subscribed; because, when
such a schism had taken place about nothing, it was right that
the Apostolic See should be careful to guard in all respects
the unity of the universal Church in the minds of priests.
But as to its being said that our daughter, Queen
Theodelinda,<note place="foot">Theodelinda held to the schismatic

were Arians. Theodelinda, the queen of the Lombards, was a Bavarian
princess and a Catholic. Her second husband, Agilulf, seems to
have been favorably disposed to Catholicism, far more so than Authari,
her first husband.

Church, wrote also four books concerning the lives of the
saints; these books he called <hi rend='italic'>Dialogus</hi>, that is, conversation,
because in them he has introduced himself speaking with his

6. Through this queen the Church of God obtained many
and great advantages. For the Lombards, when they were still
held by heathen unbelief, had taken possession of the entire
property of the Church. But, induced by successful requests
of the queen, the king, holding fast to the Catholic
faith,<note place="foot">He was not a professed Catholic. It
probably means either that he held fast to his political
alliance with Rome, or that he was determined to favor

gave the Church of Christ many possessions and assigned to

7. In these days Tassilo was made king of Bavaria by the
Frankish king Childebert. With an army he immediately
marched into the land of the Slavs, and with great booty returned
to his own land.
</p>

<p>
9. At the same time the patrician and exarch of Ravenna,
Romanus,<note place="foot">There are several letters written
by Gregory to Romanus available in translation, see above.</note>
went to Rome. On his return to Ravenna he
took possession of the cities which had been taken by the
Lombards. The names of them are: Sutrium [Sutri], Polimarcium
[near Bomarzio and west of Orte], Horta [Orte],
Tuder [Todi], Ameria [Amelia], Perusia [Perugia], Luceoli
[near Gubbio], and several others. When King Agilulf
received word of this, he at once marched forth from
Ticinus with a strong army and pitched before the city
of Perusia. Here he besieged several days the Lombard
duke Marisio, who had gone over to the side of the Romans,
took him prisoner, and without delay had him executed.
On the approach of the king, the holy Pope Gregory
was so filled with fear that, as he himself reports in his homilies,
he broke off the explanation of the temple, to be read
about in Ezekiel; King Agilulf returned to Ticinus after
he had settled the matter, and not long after, chiefly on account
of the entreaties of his wife, Queen Theodelinda, who
had often been advised in letters by the holy Father Gregory
to do so, he concluded with Gregory and the Romans a lasting
<pb n='602'/><anchor id='Pg602'/>
peace. To thank her for this, the venerable priest sent
the following letter to the queen:
</p>

<p>
Gregory to Theodelinda, queen of the Lombards. How
your excellency has labored earnestly and kindly, as is your
wont, for the conclusion of peace, we have learned from the
report of our son, the abbot Probus. Nor, indeed, was it
otherwise to be expected of your Christianity than that you
would in all ways show assiduity and goodness in the cause of
peace. Wherefore, we give thanks to Almighty God, who so
rules your heart with His lovingkindness that, as He has given
you a right faith, so He also grants you to work always what
is pleasing in His sight. For you may be assured, most excellent
daughter, that for the saving of much bloodshed on both
sides you have acquired no small reward. On this account,
returning thanks for your good-will, we implore the mercy of
God to repay you with good in body and soul here and in the
world to come. Moreover, greeting you with fatherly affection,
we exhort you so to deal with your most excellent consort
that he may not reject the alliance of the Christian republic.
For, as I believe you yourself know, it is in many
ways profitable that he should be inclined to betake himself
to its friendship. Do you then, after your manner, always
strive for what tends to good-will and conciliation between the
parties, and labor wherever an occasion of reaping a reward
presents itself, that you may commend your good deeds the
more before the eyes of Almighty God.

<head>§ 100. The Foundation of the Anglo-Saxon Church</head>

<p>
The Anglo-Saxon Church owes its foundation to the missionary
zeal and wise direction of Gregory the Great. Augustine,
whom Gregory sent, arrived in the kingdom of Kent
597, and established himself at Canterbury. In 625, Paulinus
began his work at York, and Christianity was accepted by the
Northumbrian king and many nobles. On the death of King
Eadwine, Paulinus was obliged to leave the kingdom. Missionaries
<pb n='603'/><anchor id='Pg603'/>
were brought into Northumbria in 635 from the
Celtic Church, the centre of which was at Iona, where the
new king Oswald had taken refuge on the death of Eadwine.
Aidan now became the leader of the Northern Church. As
the Christianization of the land advanced and Roman customs
were introduced into the northern kingdom, practical
inconveniences as to the different methods of reckoning the
date of Easter, in which the North Irish and the Celts of Scotland
differed from the rest of the Christian Church, came to
a settlement of the difficulty at Streaneshalch, or Whitby, 664.
Colman, Bishop of Lindisfarne, the leader of the Celtic party,
withdrew, and Wilfrid, afterward bishop of York, took the
lead under the influence of the Roman tradition. The Church
of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, now in agreement as to custom,
was organized by Theodore of Canterbury (668-690), and developed
a remarkable intellectual life, becoming, in fact, for
the first part at least of the eighth century, the centre of
Western theological and literary culture.

Gregory, in planning his mission, seems not to have been aware of
the profound changes in the kingdom resulting from the Anglo-Saxon
invasion. He selected York as the seat of an archbishop, because it
was the ancient capital of the Roman province in the North, and London,
because it was the great city of the South. The rivalry of the two
archbishops caused difficulties for centuries, and was a hinderance to
the efficiency of the ecclesiastical system. By this letter, the British
bishops were to be under the authority of Augustine, a position which
was distasteful to the British, who were extremely hostile to the Anglo-Saxons,
and incomprehensible to them, as they saw no reason or justification
in any such arrangement without their consent. They withdrew
from all intercourse with the new Anglo-Saxon Church and
retired into Wales.

he shall preside over the bishops he has ordained, so
that he shall not be subject in anywise to the bishop of London.
Moreover, let there be a distinction of honor between the
bishops of the city of London and of York, in such a way that
he shall take the precedence who has been ordained first. But
let them arrange in concord by common counsel and harmonious

The Easter dispute and the synod of Whitby. The triumph of the
Roman tradition.
</quote>

<quote rend="display">
The sharpest dispute between the Celtic and the Roman churches
was on the date of Easter as presenting the most inconveniences. The
principal points were as follows: Both parties agreed that it must
be on Sunday, in the third week of the first lunar month, and the
paschal full moon must not fall before the vernal equinox. But the
Celts placed the vernal equinox on March 25, and the Romans on
March 21. The Celts, furthermore, reckoned as the third week the
14th to the 20th days of the moon inclusive; the Romans the 15th to
the 21st inclusive. The Irish Church in the southern part of Ireland
had already adopted the Roman reckoning at the synod of Leighlin,
630-633 [Hefele, § 289]. The occasion of the difference of custom
was, in reality, that the Romans had adopted in the previous century
a more correct method of reckoning and one that had fewer
practical inconveniences. For a statement by a Celt, see Epistle
of Columbanus to Gregory the Great, in the latter's <hi rend='italic'>Epistolæ</hi>, Reg.
IX, Ep. 127 (PNF, ser. II, vol. XIII, p. 38). In the following
selection space has been saved by omissions which are, however,

<p>
At this time [<hi rend='italic'>circa</hi> 652] a great and frequent controversy
happened about the observance of Easter; those that came
from Kent or France asserting that the Scots kept Easter
Sunday contrary to the custom of the universal Church.
Among them was a most zealous defender of the true Easter,
whose name was Ronan, a Scot by nation, but instructed in
ecclesiastical truth, either in France or Italy, who disputed
<pb n='606'/><anchor id='Pg606'/>
with Finan,<note place="foot">Bishop of Lindisfarne, 652-662.</note>
and convinced many, or at least induced them, to
make a stricter inquiry after the truth; yet he could not prevail
upon Finan … James, formerly the deacon of the venerable
archbishop Paulinus … kept the true and Catholic
Easter, with all those that he could persuade to adopt the
right way. Queen Eanfleda [wife of Oswy, king of Northumbria]
and her attendants also observed the same as she
had seen practised in Kent, having with her a Kentish priest
that followed the Catholic mode, whose name was Romanus.
Thus it is said to have happened in those times that Easter
was kept twice in one year;<note place="foot">In 645, 647, 648,
651. It would occur again in 665.</note> and that when the king,
having ended the time of fasting, kept his Easter, the queen
and her attendants were still fasting and celebrating Palm
Sunday.…
</p>

<p>
After the death of Finan [662] … when Colman, who was
also sent out of Scotland, came to be bishop, a great controversy
arose about the observance of Easter, and the rules of
ecclesiastical life.… This reached the ears of King Oswy
and his son Alfrid; for Oswy, having been instructed and baptized
by the Scots, and being very perfectly skilled in their
language, thought nothing better than what they taught.
But Alfrid, having been instructed in Christianity by Wilfrid,
a most learned man, who had first gone to Rome to learn the
ecclesiastical doctrine, and spent much time at Lyons with
Dalfinus, archbishop of France, from whom he had received
the ecclesiastical tonsure, rightly thought this man's doctrine
ought to be preferred to all the traditions of the Scots.…
</p>

<p>
The controversy having been started concerning Easter, the
tonsure, and other ecclesiastical matters, it was agreed that a
synod should be held in the monastery of Streaneshalch,
which signifies the bay of the lighthouse, where the Abbess
Hilda, a woman devoted to God, presided; and that there the
controversy should be decided. The kings, both father and
son, came hither. Bishop Colman, with his Scottish clerks,
<pb n='607'/><anchor id='Pg607'/>
and Agilbert,<note place="foot">Bishop of the West Saxons,
temporarily in Northumbria.</note>
and the priests Agatho and Wilfrid. James and
Romanus were on their side. But the Abbess Hilda and her
associates were for the Scots, as was also the venerable bishop
Cedd, long before ordained by the Scots.… Then Colman
said: <q>The Easter which I keep, I received from my elders
who sent me hither as bishop; all our fathers, men beloved of
God, are known to have kept it in the same manner; and that
the same may not seem to any to be contemptible or worthy
of being rejected, it is the same which St. John the Evangelist,
the disciple especially beloved of our Lord, with all the
churches over which he presided, is recorded as having observed.…</q>
</p>

<p>
Wilfrid, having been ordered by the king to speak, said:
<q>The Easter which we observe we saw celebrated by all at
Rome, where the blessed Apostles, Peter and Paul, lived,
taught, suffered, and were buried; we saw the same done in
Italy and France, when we travelled through those countries
for pilgrimage and prayer. We found the same practised
in Africa, Asia, Egypt, Greece, and in all the world, wherever
the Church of Christ is spread abroad, through several nations
and tongues, at one and the same time … except only
those and their accomplices in obstinacy, I mean the Picts
and the Britons, who foolishly, in these two remote islands of
the world, and only in part of them, oppose all the rest of the
universe.… John, pursuant to the custom of the law, began
the celebration of the feast of Easter on the fourteenth day
of the month, in the evening, not regarding whether the same
happened on a Saturday or any other day.… Thus it appears
that you, Colman, neither follow the example of John,
as you imagine, nor that of Peter, whose traditions you knowingly
contradict.… For John, keeping the paschal time
according to the decree of the Mosaic law, had no regard to
the first day after the Sabbath [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, that it should fall on
Sunday], and you who celebrate Easter only on the first day
after the Sabbath do not practise this. Peter kept Easter
<pb n='608'/><anchor id='Pg608'/>
Sunday between the fifteenth and the twenty-first day of the
moon, and you do not do this, but keep Easter Sunday from
the fourteenth to the twentieth day of the moon, so that you
often begin Easter on the thirteenth moon in the evening …
besides this in your celebration of Easter, you utterly exclude
the twenty-first day of the moon, which the law ordered to be
especially observed.</q>
</p>

<p>
To this Colman rejoined: <q>Did Anatolius, a holy man, and
much commended in ecclesiastical history, act contrary to
the Law and the Gospel when he wrote that Easter was to
be celebrated from the fourteenth to the twentieth? Is it to
be believed that our most reverend Father Columba and his
successors, men beloved of God, who kept Easter after the
same manner, thought or acted contrary to the divine writings?
Whereas there were many among them whose sanctity
was attested by heavenly signs and the workings of miracles,
whose life, customs, discipline I never cease to follow, not
questioning that they are saints in heaven.</q>
</p>

<p>
Wilfrid said: <q>It is evident that Anatolius was a most holy
and learned and commendable man; but what have you to do
with him, since you do not observe his decrees? For he, following
the rule of truth in his Easter, appointed a cycle of
nineteen years, which you are either ignorant of, or if you
know yet despise, though it is kept by the whole Church of
Christ.… Concerning your Father Columba and his followers …
I do not deny that they were God's servants,
and beloved by Him, who, with rustic simplicity but pious
intentions, have themselves loved Him.… But as for you
and your companions, you certainly sin, if, having heard the
decrees of the Apostolic See, or rather of the universal Church,
and the same confirmed by Holy Scripture, you refuse to follow
them. For though your Fathers were holy, do you think
that their small number in a corner of the remotest island is
to be preferred before the universal Church of Christ throughout
the world? And if that Columba of yours (and, I may
say, ours also, if he was Christ's servant) was a holy man and
<pb n='609'/><anchor id='Pg609'/>
powerful in miracles, yet could he be preferred before the
most blessed prince of the Apostles, to whom our Lord said:
<q>Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church,
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it, and to thee I
will give the keys of the kingdom of heaven</q>?</q>
</p>

<p>
When Wilfrid had thus spoken, the king said: <q>Is it true,
Colman, that these words were spoken to Peter by our Lord?</q>
He answered: <q>It is true, O king.</q> Then he said: <q>Can you
show any such power given to your Columba?</q> Colman answered:
<q>None.</q> Then the king added: <q>Do you both agree
that these words were principally directed to Peter, and that
the keys of heaven were given to him by our Lord?</q> They
both answered: <q>We do.</q> Then the king concluded: <q>And I
also say unto you that he is the doorkeeper whom I will not
contradict, but will, as far as I know and am able in all things,
obey his decrees, lest, when I come to the gates of the kingdom
of heaven, there should be one to open them, he being
my adversary who is proved to have the keys.</q> The king
having said this, all present, both small and great, gave their
assent, and renounced the more imperfect institution, and
resolved to conform to that which they found to be better.…
[ch. 26]. Colman, perceiving that his doctrine was
rejected and his sect despised, took with him such as would
not comply with the Catholic Easter and the tonsure (for
there was much controversy about that also) and went back
to Scotland to consult with his people what was to be done
in this case. Cedd, forsaking the practices of the Scots, returned
to his bishopric, having submitted to the Catholic
observance of Easter. This disputation happened in the year
of our Lord's incarnation, 664.

<p>
In the name of our Lord God and Saviour Jesus Christ,
in the perpetual reign of the same Lord Jesus Christ and His
government of His Church. It seemed good that we should
come together according to the prescription of the venerable
canons, to treat of the necessary affairs of the Church. We are
met together on this 24th day of September, the first indiction
in the place called Hertford. I, Theodore, although unworthy,
appointed by the Apostolic See bishop of the church
of Canterbury, and our fellow priest the most reverend Bisi,
bishop of the East Angles, together with our brother and
fellow bishop Wilfrid, bishop of the nation of the Northumbrians,
present by his proper legates, as also our brethren
and fellow bishops, Putta, bishop of the Castle of the Kentishmen
called Rochester, Leutherius, bishop of the West Saxons,
and Winfrid, bishop of the province of the Mercians, were
present. When we were assembled and had taken our places,
each according to his rank, I said: I beseech you, beloved
brethren, for the fear and love of our Redeemer, that we all
labor in common for our faith, that whatsoever has been
decreed and determined by the holy and approved Fathers
may be perfectly followed by us all. I enlarged upon these
and many other things tending unto charity and the preservation
of the unity of the Church. And when I had finished
my speech I asked them singly and in order whether they
consented to observe all things which had been canonically
decreed by the Fathers? To which all our fellow priests
answered: We are all well agreed readily and most cheerfully
to keep whatever the canons of the holy Fathers have prescribed.
<pb n='611'/><anchor id='Pg611'/>
Whereupon I immediately produced the book of
canons,<note place="foot">Coming from Rome under the circumstances
in which he was sent, this book of the canons can be no other than
the collection of Dionysius Exiguus.</note>
and pointed out ten chapters from the same book,
which I had marked, because I knew that they were especially
necessary for us, and proposed that they should be diligently
observed by all, namely:
</p>

<p>
Ch. 1. That we shall jointly observe Easter day on the
Lord's day after the fourteenth day of the moon in the first
month.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 2. That no bishop invade the diocese of another, but
be content with the government of the people committed to
him.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 3. That no bishop be allowed to trouble in any way
any monasteries consecrated to God, nor to take away by
violence anything that belongs to them.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 4. That the monks themselves go not from place to
place; that is, from one monastery to another, without letters
dismissory of their own abbot;<note place="foot">See below,
<ref target="Section_105">§ 105</ref>.</note> but that they shall continue
in that obedience which they promised at the time of
their conversion.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 5. That no clerk, leaving his own bishop, go up and
down at his own pleasure, nor be received wherever he comes,
without commendatory letters from his bishop; but if he be
once received and refuse to return when he is desired so to
do, both the receiver and the received shall be laid under an
excommunication.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 6. That stranger bishops and clerks be content with
the hospitality that is freely offered them; and none of them
be allowed to exercise any sacerdotal function without permission
of the bishop in whose diocese he is known to be.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 7. That a synod be assembled twice in the year. But,
because many occasions may hinder this, it was jointly agreed
by all that once in the year it be assembled on the first of
August in the place called Clovesho.
</p>

<pb n='612'/><anchor id='Pg612'/>

<p>
Ch. 8. That no bishop ambitiously put himself before
another, but that every one observe the time and order of his
consecration.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 9. The ninth chapter was discussed together: That
the number of bishops be increased as the number of the
faithful grew;<note place="foot">Cf. Bede, <hi rend='italic'>Epistula
ad Egberium Episcopum</hi>; Plummer, <hi rend='italic'>op. cit.</hi>,
I. 412 <hi rend='italic'>f.</hi></note> but we did nothing as to this point at
present.
</p>

<p>
Ch. 10. As to marriages: That none shall be allowed to
any but what is a lawful marriage. Let none commit incest.
Let none relinquish his own wife but for fornication, as the
holy Gospel teaches. But if any have dismissed a wife united
to him in lawful marriage, let him not be joined to another if
he wish really to be a Christian, but remain as he is or be
reconciled to his own wife.
</p>

<p>
After we had jointly treated on and discussed these chapters,
that no scandalous contention should arise henceforth
by any of us, and that there be no changes in the publication
of them, it seemed proper that every one should confirm by
the subscription of his own hand whatever had been determined.
I dictated this our definitive sentence to be written
by Titillus, the notary. Done in the month and indiction
above noted. Whosoever, therefore, shall attempt in any way
to oppose or infringe this sentence, confirmed by our present
consent, and the subscription of our hands as agreeable to the
decrees of the canons, let him know that he is deprived of
every sacerdotal function and our society. May the divine
grace preserve us safe living in the unity of the Church.

and being desirous that the churches of the English
over which he ruled should be free from such a stain, having
collected an assembly of venerable priests and very many
doctors, diligently inquired what belief they each held, and
found unanimous agreement of all in the Catholic faith; and
this he took care to commit to a synodical letter for the instruction
and remembrance of posterity. This is the beginning
of the letter:
</p>

<p>
In the name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, in the
reign of our most pious lords, Egfrid, king of the Humbrians,
in the tenth year of his reign, on the fifteenth day before the
Kalends of October [September 17] in the eighth indiction, and
Ethelred, king of the Mercians, in the sixth year of his reign;
and Adwulf, king of the Kentishmen, in the seventh year of
his reign; Theodore being president, by the grace of God,
archbishop of the island of Britain and of the city of Canterbury,
and other venerable men sitting with him, bishops of
the island of Britain, with the holy Gospels laid before them,
and in the place which is called by the Saxon name of Hatfield,
we, handling the subject in concert, have made an exposition
of the right and orthodox faith, as our incarnate Lord Jesus
Christ delivered it to His disciples, who saw Him present
and heard His discourses, and as the creed of the holy Fathers
has delivered it, and all the holy and universal synods and all
the chorus of approved doctors of the Catholic Church teach.
We therefore piously and orthodoxly following them and,
making our profession according to their divinely inspired
teaching, believe in unison with it, and confess according to
the holy Fathers that the Father and the Son and the Holy
Ghost are properly and truly a consubstantial Trinity in
unity, and unity in Trinity; that is, in one God in three consubstantial
subsistencies or persons of equal glory and honor.
</p>

<pb n='614'/><anchor id='Pg614'/>

<p>
And after many things of this kind that pertained to the
confession of the right faith, the holy synod also adds these
things to its letter:
</p>

<p>
We have received as holy and universal five synods of the
blessed Fathers acceptable to God; that is, of the three hundred
and eighteen assembled at Nicæa against the most impious
Arius and his tenets; and of the one hundred and fifty
at Constantinople against the madness of Macedonius and
Eudoxius and their tenets; and of the two hundred in the
first Council of Ephesus against the most wicked Nestorius
and his tenets; and of the six hundred and thirty at Chalcedon
against Eutyches and Nestorius and their tenets; and again
of those assembled in a fifth council at Constantinople [A. D.
553], in the time of the younger Justinian, against Theodore
and the epistles of Theodoret and Ibas and their tenets against
Cyril.
</p>

<p>
And a little after: Also we have received the synod<note place="foot">A. D.

anything; and we anathematize with heart and

received we receive, glorifying God the Father without beginning,
and his only begotten Son, begotten of the Father before
the world began, and the Holy Ghost proceeding ineffably
from the Father and the Son, as those holy Apostles, prophets,
and doctors have declared whom we have mentioned above.
And we all who with Theodore have made an exposition of
the Catholic faith have subscribed hereto.

<head>Chapter III. The Foundation Of The Ecclesiastical Institutions Of The
Middle Ages</head>

<p>
In the period between the conversion of the Franks and the
rise of the dynasty of Charles Martel, or the period comprising
the sixth and seventh centuries, the foundation was laid
for those ecclesiastical institutions which are peculiar to the
Middle Ages, and found in the mediæval Church their full
embodiment. In the Church the Latin element was still more
or less dominant, and society was only slowly transformed
by the Germanic elements. In the adjustment of Roman institutions
to the new political conditions in which Germanic
factors were dominant, the Germanic and the Roman elements
are accordingly found in constantly varying proportions.
In the case of the diocesan and parochial organization,
only very slowly could the Church in the West attain
that complete organization which had long since been established
in the East, and here Roman ideas were profoundly
modified by Germanic legal principles (<ref target="Section_101">§ 101</ref>).
But at the same time the Church's body of teaching and methods of
moral training were made clearly intelligible and more applicable
to the new conditions of Christian life. The teaching of
Augustine was received only in part at the Council of Orange,
A. D. 529 (<hi rend='italic'>v. supra</hi>, <ref target="Section_85">§ 85</ref>),
and it was profoundly modified by the moralistic type of
theology traceable to Tertullian and even further back
(<hi rend='italic'>v. supra</hi>, <ref target="Section_39">§ 39</ref>).
It was, furthermore, completed
by a clearer and more precise statement of the doctrines
of purgatory and the sacrifice of the mass, and to the
death of Christ was applied unequivocally the doctrine of
merit which had been developed in the West in connection
with the early penitential discipline, and which was seen to
throw a new light upon the sacrifice of Christ upon the cross.
These conceptions served as a foundation for new discussions,
and confirmed tendencies already present in the Church
(<ref target="Section_102">§ 102</ref>). Connected with
this theology was the penitential discipline, which, growing
out of the ancient discipline as
<pb n='616'/><anchor id='Pg616'/>
modified by the earlier form of monastic life, especially in
Ireland, came under the influence of the Germanic legal conceptions
(<ref target="Section_103">§ 103</ref>). In the same period
monasticism was organized upon a new rule by Benedict of Nursia
(<ref target="Section_104">§ 104</ref>), and
the need of provision for the education of the young and for
the training of the clergy was felt and, to some extent, provided
for by monastery schools and other methods of education
(<ref target="Section_105">§ 105</ref>).

<p>
An outline of some of the legislation is here given, whereby
the parish as organized in the West was built up, and the diocese
was made to consist of a number of parishes under the
bishop, who, however, did not exercise an absolute control
over the incomes and position of the priests under him.

The preface is, therefore, given as being significant.

<p>
Since this holy synod has been assembled in the name of
the Lord and with the permission of our most glorious, magnificent,
and most pious king in the city of Agde, there, with
knees bent and on the ground, we have prayed for his kingdom,
<pb n='617'/><anchor id='Pg617'/>
his long life, for the people, that the lord who has given
us permission to assemble, may happily extend his kingdom,
that he may govern justly and protect valiantly; we have
assembled in the basilica of St. Andrew to treat of the discipline
and the ordination of pontiffs and other things of utility
to the Church.
</p>

<p>
Canon 21. If any one wishes to have an oratory in the
fields outside of the parishes, in which the gathering of the
people is lawful and appointed, we permit him to have a mass
there with the proper license on the other festivals, on account
of the weariness of the family [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, in going to the distant
parish church], but on Easter, Christmas, Epiphany, Ascension
Day, Pentecost and the Nativity of St. John the Baptist,
or if there are any other very high festival days observed, let
them hold no masses except in the cities and parishes. But
if the clergy, without the command or permission of the
bishop, hold and perform the masses on the festivals above
mentioned in the oratories, let them be driven from the communion.
</p>

<p>
Canon 30. Because it is appropriate that the service of
the Church be observed in the same way by all, it is to be
desired that it be done so everywhere. After the antiphones
the collects shall be said in order by the bishops and presbyters,
and the hymns of Matins and Vespers be sung daily;
and at the conclusion of the mass of Matins and
Vespers,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Matitutinarum vel

applied, not to the eucharist, but to Matins and Vespers. See

after the hymns a chapter of the Psalms shall be read, and the
people who are gathered shall, after the prayer, be dismissed
with a benediction of the bishop until Vespers.
</p>

<p>
Canon 38. Without letters commendatory of their bishops,
it is not permitted to the clergy to travel. The same rule is to
be observed in the case of monks. If reproof of words does
not correct them, we decree that they shall be beaten with
rods. It is also to be observed in the case of monks that it

is not permitted them to leave the community for solitary
cells, unless the more severe rule is remitted by their abbot
to them who have been approved in the hermit life, or on
account of the necessity of infirmity; but only then let it be
done so that they remain within the walls of the same monastery,
and they are permitted to have separate cells under the
authority of the abbots. It is not permitted abbots to have
different cells or many monasteries, or except on account of the
inroads of enemies to erect dwellings within walls.

that he shall not dedicate a church or basilica before he shall
have received the endowment of the basilica and its service

<head>§ 102. Western Piety and Thought in the Period of the Conversion of the
Barbarians</head>

<p>
In the century following Augustine, the dogmatic interest
of the Church was chiefly absorbed in the Christological controversies
in the East. There were, however, some discussions
in the West arising from the manifest difficulty of reconciling
the doctrine of predestination, as drawn from Augustine, with
<pb n='621'/><anchor id='Pg621'/>
the efficacy of baptism. For the adjustment of the teaching
of Augustine to the sacramental system of the Church and to
baptism more particularly, see the Council of Orange, A. D.
529, of which the principal conclusions are given above
(<ref target="Section_85">§ 85</ref>).
In the sixth century and in the early part of the seventh, doctrines
were clearly enunciated which had been abundantly
foreshadowed by earlier writers, but had not been fitted into
an intelligible and practical system. These were especially
the doctrine of purgatory and the sacrifice of the mass. The
doctrine of purgatory completed the penitential system of the
early Church by making it possible to expiate sin by suffering
in a future existence, in the case of those who had died without
completely doing penance here. By the sacrifice of the
mass the advantages of Christ's death were constantly applied,
not merely to the sin of the world in general, but to
specified objects; the believer was brought into closest contact
with the great act of redemption, and a centre was placed
around which the life of the individual and the authority of
the hierarchy could be brought into relation.

against us, we diligently redeem our sins, lest by chance when
collected together against us at once they make a great mass

which the Apostle said: <q>Because it will be revealed by fire,
<pb n='622'/><anchor id='Pg622'/>
and if any man's work is burned he will suffer loss</q> (I Cor.

by good works we do not redeem our sins, we will remain so
long in that fire of purification<note place="foot">The

and fires of purification is very much later, and not defined until the thirteenth

Ch. 8. All saints who serve God truly strive to give themselves
to reading and prayer, and to perseverance in good
works, and building no mortal sins and no little sins, that is,
wood, hay, and stubble, upon the foundation of Christ; but
good works, that is, gold, silver, and precious stones, will without
injury go through that fire of which the Apostle spoke:
<q>Because it will be revealed by fire.</q> But those who, although
they do not commit capital sins, yet are prone to commit very
little sins and are negligent in redeeming them, will attain
to eternal life because they believed in Christ, but first either
in this life they are purified by bitter tribulation, or certainly
in that fire of which the Apostle speaks they are to be tormented,
that they may come to eternal life without spot or
wrinkle. But those who have committed homicide, sacrilege,
adultery and other similar sins, if there does not come to their
aid suitable penitence, will not deserve to go through that
fire of purification to life, but they will be thrown into death
by eternal fire.

It should be considered that it is safer to do to men, while
one is living, the good which one hopes will be done by others
after one's death. It is more blessed to depart free than to
seek liberty after chains. We ought, with our whole mind,
despise the present world, especially since we see it already
<pb n='623'/><anchor id='Pg623'/>
passing away. We ought to immolate to God the daily sacrifice
of our tears, the daily offerings of His flesh and blood.
For this offering peculiarly preserves the soul from eternal
death, and it renews to us in a mystery the death of the Only
begotten, who, although being risen from the dead, dieth no
more, and death hath no more dominion over Him (Rom. 6:9);
yet, while in Himself He liveth immortal and incorruptible,
for us He is immolated again in this mystery of the sacred
oblation. For it is His body that is there given, His flesh
that is divided for the salvation of the people, His blood that
is poured, no longer into the hands of unbelievers, but into the
mouths of the faithful. For this let us ever estimate what
this sacrifice is for us, which for our absolution ever imitates
the passion of the only begotten Son. For what one of the
faithful can have any doubt that at the very hour of the offering
[<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">immolatio</foreign>],
at the word of the priest, the heavens are
opened, the choirs of angels are present at the mystery of
Jesus Christ, the lowest things are united to the highest,
earthly things with heavenly, and from the invisible and the
visible there is made one?

From these sayings [John 12:35; II Cor. 6:2; Eccles. 9:10]
it is evident that as one left the earth so one will appear

certain slight sins there is to be before that judgment a fire

Not long before our time the case is told of a certain man who,
having been taken captive, was carried far away [<hi rend='italic'>cf. Dialog.</hi>,
IV, 57], and because he was held a long time in chains his
wife, since she had not received him back from that captivity,
believed him to be dead and every week she had the sacrifice
offered for him as already dead. And as often as the sacrifice
was offered by his spouse for the absolution of his soul, the
chains were loosed in his captivity. For having returned a
long time after, greatly astonished he told his wife that on
certain days each week his chains were loosed. His wife
considered the days and hours, and then knew that he was
loosed when, as she remembered, the sacrifice was offered for
him. From that perceive, my dearest brothers, to what extent
the holy sacrifice offered by us is able to loose the bonds
of the heart, if the sacrifice offered by one for another can
loose the chains of the body.

<head>§ 103. The Foundation of the Mediæval Penitential System</head>

<p>
The penitential system, as it was organized in the Western
Church in the sixth, seventh, and eighth centuries, was but
the carrying out of principles which had appeared elsewhere in
Christendom and were involved in the primitive method of
dealing with moral delinquents by the authorities of the
Church. [See the epistles of Basil the Great to Amphilochius
(Ep. 189, 199, 217) in PNF, ser. II, vol. VIII.] Similar problems
had to be handled everywhere whenever the Church
came to deal with moral conduct, and much the same solution
was found everywhere. There is, however, no known connection
between the earliest penitentials of the Western Church,
those of Ireland, and the similar books of the East. There
is no need of supposing that there was a connection. But
in the case of the works attributed to Theodore of Tarsus,
archbishop of Canterbury, himself a Greek and probably a
<pb n='625'/><anchor id='Pg625'/>
native of Tarsus, there is a provable connection which is
evident to any one reading his work, as he refers to Basil and
others. The characteristics of the Western penitentials are
their minute division of sins, their exact determination of
penances for each sin, and the great extent to which they
were used in the practical work of the Church. They serve
as the first crude beginnings of a moral theology of a practical
character, such as would be needed by the poorly trained
parish clergy of the times in dealing with their flocks. On
account of the nature of these works, it is hardly necessary
or expedient to give more than a few brief extracts in addition
to references to sources. Much of the matter is extremely
offensive to modern taste.

XI. <hi rend='italic'>On Counsel to be Given.</hi>
</p>

<p>
We read in the penitential of doing penance on bread and
water, for the great sins one year or two or three years, and
for little sins a month or a week. Likewise in the case of
some the conditions are harsh and difficult. Therefore to him
who cannot do these things we give the counsel that psalms,
prayers, and almsgiving ought to be performed some days in
penance for these; that is, that psalms are for one day when he
ought to do penance on bread and water. Therefore he should
sing fifty psalms on his knees, and if not on his knees seventy
psalms inside the church or in one place. For a week on bread
and water, let him sing on his knees three hundred psalms in
order and in the church or in one place. And for one month
on bread and water, one thousand five hundred psalms kneeling,
or if not kneeling one thousand eight hundred and twenty,
and afterward let him fast every day until the sixth hour and
abstain from flesh and wine; but whatsoever other food God
has given him let him eat, after he has sung the psalms.
And he who does not know psalms ought to do penance and
to fast, and every day let him give to the poor the value of a
denarius, and fast one day until the ninth hour, and the next
until vespers, and after that whatsoever he has let him eat.

<head>§ 104. The New Monasticism and the Rule of Benedict of Nursia</head>

<p>
In the first centuries of monasticism in the West, the greatest
variety was to be found among the constitutions of the
various monastic houses and the rules drawn up by great
leaders in the ascetic movement. This variety extended even
to the nature of the vows assumed and their obligation. Benedict
of Nursia (circa 480 to circa 544), gave the rule according
to which for some centuries nearly all the monasteries of the
West were ultimately organized. The first great example of
this rule in operation was Benedict's own monastery at Monte
Cassino. For a time the rule of Benedict came into conflict
<pb n='631'/><anchor id='Pg631'/>
with that of Columbanus in Gaul.<note place="foot">For the rule
of Columbanus, see MSL, 80:209 <hi rend='italic'>ff.</hi></note>
But the powerful recommendation
of Gregory the Great, who had introduced it in
Rome, and the intrinsic superiority of the rule itself made the
Benedictine system triumphant. It should be noted that the
Benedictine cloisters were for centuries independent establishments
and only formed into organized groups of monasteries
in the great monastic reforms of the tenth and following
centuries. It is a question how far the Benedictine rule
was introduced into England in the early centuries of the
Anglo-Saxon Church, although it is often taken for granted
that it was introduced by Augustine. Critical edition of the
Benedictine rule by Wölfflin, Leipsic, 1895; in Migne's edition
there is an elaborate commentary with many illustrative
extracts and formulæ, as well as traditional glosses.

(MSL, 66:246.)</head>

<p>
1. <hi rend='italic'>Concerning the kinds of monks and their modes of living.</hi>
It is manifest that there are four kinds of monks. The
first is that of the cenobites, that is the monastic, serving
under a rule and an abbot. The second kind is that of the
anchorites, that is the hermits, those who have learned to
fight against the devil, not by the new fervor of conversion,
but by a long probation in a monastery, having been taught
already by association with many; and having been well
prepared in the army of the brethren for the solitary fight
of the hermit, and secure now without the encouragement of
another, they are able, God helping them, to fight with their
own hand or arm against the vices of the flesh or of their
thoughts. But a third and very bad kind of monks are the
sarabites, not tried as gold in the furnace by a rule, experience
being their teacher, but softened after the manner of lead;
<pb n='632'/><anchor id='Pg632'/>
keeping faith with the world by their works, they are known
by their tonsure to lie to God. Being shut up by twos and
threes alone and without a shepherd, in their own and not in
the Lord's sheepfold, they have their own desires for a law.
For whatever they think good and choose, that they deem
holy; and what they do not wish, that they consider unlawful.
But the fourth kind of monk is the kind called the <hi rend='italic'>gyrovagi</hi>,
who during their whole life are guests for three or four days
at a time in the cells of different monasteries throughout the
various provinces; they are always wandering and never
stationary, serving their own pleasures and the allurements of
the palate, and in every way worse than the sarabites. Concerning
the most wretched way of all, it is better to keep
silence than to speak. These things, therefore, being omitted,
let us proceed with the aid of God to treat of the best kind,
the cenobites.
</p>

<p>
2. <hi rend='italic'>What the abbot should be like.</hi> An abbot who is worthy
to preside over a monastery ought always to remember what
he is called and to carry out in his deeds the name of a superior.
For in the monastery he is believed to be Christ's representative,
since he is called by His name, the Apostle saying:
<q>We have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we
cry Abba, Father</q> [Rom. 8:15]. And so the abbot ought
not (and oh that he may not!) teach or decree or order anything
apart from the precepts of the Lord; but his order or
teaching should be sprinkled with the leaven of divine justice
in the minds of his disciples.… No distinctions of
persons shall be made by him in the monastery. One shall
not be loved by him more than another, unless the one
whom he finds excelling in good work and obedience. A free-born
man shall not be preferred to one coming from servitude,
unless there be some reasonable cause. But when it is just
and it seems good to the abbot he shall show preference no
matter what the rank shall be. But otherwise they shall
keep their own places; for, whether we be bound or free, we
are all one in Christ, and under God we perform an equal
<pb n='633'/><anchor id='Pg633'/>
service of subjection; for God is no respecter of persons
[Acts 10:34].…
</p>

<p>
3. <hi rend='italic'>Concerning calling the brethren to take counsel.</hi> As often as
anything unusual is to be done in the monastery, let the abbot
call together the whole congregation and himself explain the
question before them. And having heard the advice of the
brethren, he shall consider it by himself, and let him do what
he judges most advantageous. And for this reason, moreover,
we have said that all ought to be called to take counsel;
because it is often to a younger person that the Lord reveals
what is best. The brethren, moreover, ought, with all humble
subjection, to give their advice so that they do not too boldly
presume to defend what seems good to them, but it should
rather depend upon the judgment of the abbot; so that, whatever
he decides upon as the more salutary, they should all
agree to it.…
</p>

<p>
4. <hi rend='italic'>Concerning the instruments of good works.</hi>
</p>

<p>
5. <hi rend='italic'>Concerning obedience.</hi> The first grade of humility is
prompt obedience. This becomes those who, on account of
the holy service which they professed, or on account of the
fear of hell or the glory of eternal life, consider nothing dearer
to them than Christ; so that as soon as anything is commanded
by their superior, they may not know how to suffer delay in
doing it, even as if it were a divine command.…

</p>

<p>
33. <hi rend='italic'>Whether monks should have anything of their own.</hi> More
than anything else is this special vice to be cut off root and
branch from the monastery, that one should presume to give
or receive anything without order from the abbot, or should
have anything of his own; he should have absolutely nothing,
neither a book nor tablets nor a pen, nothing at all—for indeed
it is not allowed to have their own bodies or wills in their own
power. But all things necessary they must receive from the
father of the monastery; nor is it allowable to have anything
which the abbot has not given or permitted.…

38. <hi rend='italic'>Concerning the weekly reader.</hi>
</p>

<p>
39. <hi rend='italic'>Concerning the amount of food.</hi> We believe, moreover,
that for the daily refection of the sixth and for that of
the ninth hour as well two cooked dishes, on account of the
infirmities of the different ones, are enough in all months for
all tables; so that whoever, perchance, cannot eat of one may
partake of the other. Therefore let two cooked dishes suffice
for all the brethren; and if it is possible to obtain apples or
fresh vegetables, a third may be added. One full pound of
bread shall suffice for a day, whether there be one refection or
breakfast and supper. But if they are to have supper, the
<pb n='635'/><anchor id='Pg635'/>
third part of that same pound shall be reserved by the cellarer
to be given back to those when they are about to sup. But if
perchance some greater labor shall have been performed, it
shall be in the will and power of the abbot, if it is expedient,
to increase anything.… But to younger boys the same
quantity shall not be served, but less than to the older ones,
as moderation is to be observed in all things. But every one
shall abstain altogether from eating the flesh of four-footed
beasts except alone in the case of the weak and the sick.
</p>

<p>
40. <hi rend='italic'>Concerning the amount of drink.</hi> Each one has his
own gift from God, one in this way and another in that.
Therefore it is with some hesitation that the amount of daily
sustenance for others is fixed by us. Nevertheless, considering
the weakness of the infirm, we believe that a half pint of
wine a day is enough for each one. Those, moreover, to whom
God has given the ability of enduring abstinence should know
that they will have their own reward. But the prior shall
judge if either the needs of the place, or labor, or heat of the
summer require more; considering, in all things, lest satiety or
drunkenness creep in. Indeed, we read that wine is not
suitable for monks at all. But, because in our times it is not
possible to persuade monks of this, let us agree at least as to
the fact that we should not drink until we are sated, but sparingly.
For wine can make even the wise to go astray. Where,
moreover, the limitations of the place are such that the amount
written above cannot be found, but much less or nothing at
all, those who live there shall bless God and shall not murmur.
And we admonish them as to this, above all, that they be
without murmuring.

<p>
41. <hi rend='italic'>At what hours the brethren ought to take their refection.</hi>
42. <hi rend='italic'>That after Compline no one shall speak.</hi>
43. <hi rend='italic'>Concerning those who come late to Divine Service or to table.</hi>
44. <hi rend='italic'>Concerning those who are excommunicated and how they shall render
satisfaction.</hi> 45. <hi rend='italic'>Concerning those who make mistakes in the
oratory.</hi> 46. <hi rend='italic'>Concerning those who err in other matters.</hi> 47.
<hi rend='italic'>Concerning the announcement of the hour of Divine Service.</hi>
</p>

<pb n='636'/><anchor id='Pg636'/>

<p>
48. <hi rend='italic'>Concerning the daily manual labor.</hi> Idleness is the
enemy of the soul. Therefore at fixed times the brethren
ought to be occupied in manual labor; and again at fixed
times in sacred reading. Therefore we believe that according
to this disposition both seasons ought to be so arranged
that, from Easter until the first of October, going out early
from the first until about the fourth hour, they shall labor at
what might be necessary. Moreover, from the fourth until
about the sixth hour, they shall give themselves to reading.
After the sixth hour, moreover, rising from table, they shall
rest in their beds with all silence; or perchance he that wishes
to read may so read to himself that he shall not disturb another.
And nones shall be said rather early, about the middle
of the eighth hour; and again they shall work at what is
necessary until vespers. But if the exigency or the poverty
of the place demands that they shall be occupied by themselves
in picking fruits, they shall not be cast down; for
then they are truly monks if they live by the labor of their
hands, as did also our Fathers and the Apostles.
</p>

<p>
From the first of October until the beginning of Lent, they
shall give themselves unto reading until the second full hour.
At the second hour tierce shall be said, and all shall labor at
the task which is enjoined upon them until the ninth. When
the first signal of the ninth hour shall have been given they
shall each leave off his work and be ready when the second signal
strikes. Moreover, after the refection they shall give
themselves to their reading or to the Psalms.
</p>

<p>
And in the days of Lent, from dawn until the third full
hour, they shall give themselves to their reading; and until
the tenth hour they shall do the labor that is enjoined upon
them. In the days of Lent they shall all receive separate
books from the library, which they shall read through completely
in order; these books shall be given out on the first
day of Lent. Above all, there shall certainly be appointed
one or two elders to go around the monastery at the hours in
which the brethren are engaged in reading and see to it that
<pb n='637'/><anchor id='Pg637'/>
no troublesome brother is to be found who is given to idleness
and chatting and is not intent upon his reading and is
not only of no use to himself but disturbing the others. If
such an one (and may there not be such!) be found, he shall
be admonished once and a second time. If he does not amend,
he shall be subject under the rule to such punishment that
others may fear. Nor shall the brethren assemble at unsuitable
hours.
</p>

<p>
On Sundays all shall give themselves to reading except
those who are deputed to various duties. But if any one be
so negligent and lazy that he will not or cannot meditate or
read, some task shall be imposed upon him which he can perform,
so that he be not idle. On feeble and delicate brothers
such a labor or art is to be imposed that they shall neither be
idle nor so oppressed by the burden of labor as to be driven to
take to flight. Their weakness is to be taken into consideration
by the abbot.

guest cell. After this let him be in the cell of the novices,
where he shall meditate and eat and sleep. And an elder
shall be appointed for him such as shall be capable of winning
<pb n='638'/><anchor id='Pg638'/>
souls, who shall altogether intently watch him, and be zealous
to see if he in truth seek God, if he be zealous for the work of
God, for obedience, for suffering shame. And above all the
harshness and roughness of the means through which one approaches
God shall be told him in advance. If he promise
perseverance in his steadfastness after the lapse of two months,
this Rule shall be read over to him in order, and it shall be said
to him: Behold the law under which thou didst wish to serve;
if thou canst observe it, enter; but if thou canst not, depart
freely. If he shall have stood firm thus far, then he shall be
led into the aforesaid cell of the novices, and again he shall be
proven with all patience.
</p>

<p>
And after the lapse of six months, the Rule shall be reread to
him, that he may know upon what he is entering. And
if he persist thus far, after four months the same Rule shall still
again be read to him. If, after deliberating with himself, he
shall promise that he will observe all things and to obey all the
commands laid upon him, then he shall be received into the
congregation, knowing that it is decreed that by the law of
the Rule he shall from that day not be allowed to depart from
the monastery, nor to shake free from his neck the yoke of the
Rule, which after such painful deliberation he was at liberty
to refuse or receive.
</p>

<p>
He who is to be received shall make in the oratory, in the
presence of all, a promise before God and His saints concerning
his stability [<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">stabilitas loci</foreign>]
and the change in the manner of his life
[<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">conversio morum</foreign>] and obedience
[<foreign lang="la" rend="font-style: italic">obedientia</foreign>],<note
place="foot">This with the two preceding are the three vows of the Benedictine
monk.</note> so that if at any time he act contrary he shall know that he
shall be condemned by Him whom he mocks. And concerning
this, his promise, he shall make a petition addressed by name to
the saints whose relics are there, and to the abbot who is
present. And this petition he shall write out with his own
hand; or, if he be really unlearned in letters, let another at
his request write it, and to that the novice shall make his sign.
With his own hand he shall place it upon the altar. And when
<pb n='639'/><anchor id='Pg639'/>
he has placed it there, the novice shall immediately begin
this verse: <q>Receive me O Lord according to Thy promise
and I shall live; and cast me not down from my hope</q>
[Psalm 119:116, Vulgate version]. And this verse the whole
congregation shall repeat three times adding: Glory be to the
Father, etc. Then that brother novice shall prostrate himself
at the feet of each one that they may pray for him. And
already from that day he shall be considered as in the congregation.
</p>

<p>
If he have any property, he shall first either present it to the
poor or, making a solemn donation, shall confer it on the monastery,
receiving nothing at all for himself; and he shall know
for a fact that from that day he shall have no power even over
his own body. Immediately thereafter, in the monastery, he
shall take off his own garments in which he was clad, and shall
put on the garments of the monastery. Those garments, furthermore,
which he has taken off shall be placed in the vestiary
to be preserved; so that if, at any time, on the devil's
persuasion, he shall wish to go forth from the monastery (and
may it never happen) then, taking off the garments of the
monastery let him be cast out. But the petition he made and
which the abbot took from upon the altar, he shall not receive
again, but it shall be preserved in the monastery.
</p>

<p>
59. <hi rend='italic'>Concerning the sons of nobles and poor men who are presented.</hi>
If by chance any one of the nobles offers his son to
God in the monastery, and the boy himself is a minor in age,
his parents shall make the petition of which we have spoken
above. And with an oblation, they shall wrap the petition
and the hand of the boy in the linen cloth of the altar; and
thus shall they offer him. Concerning their property, either
they shall promise in the present petition, under an oath, that
they will never, either indirectly or otherwise, give him anything
at any time, or furnish him with means of possessing it. Or,
if they be unwilling to do this, and wish to offer something as
alms to the monastery for their salvation, they shall make a
donation of those things which they wish to give to the monastery,
<pb n='640'/><anchor id='Pg640'/>
retaining for themselves the usufruct if they so wish.
And let all things be so observed that no suspicion may remain
with the boy; by which, as we have learned from experience,
being deceived, he might perish (and may it not happen). The
poorer ones shall do likewise. Those who have nothing at all
shall simply make their petitions; and with an oblation they
shall offer their sons before witnesses.

for those who hasten to the perfection of living, there are the
teachings of the holy Fathers; the observance of which leads
a man to the heights of perfection. For what page or what
discourse of divine authority in the Old or New Testament
is not a more perfect rule of human life? Or what book of the
holy and Catholic Fathers does not trumpet forth how by the
right road we shall come to our Creator?
</p>

<p>
Also the reading aloud of the Fathers, and their decrees
and lives; also the Rule of our holy Father Basil—what else
are they except instruments of virtue for good living and obedient
monks? But to us who are idle and evil livers and negligent
there is the blush of confusion. Thou, therefore, whoever
hastens to the heavenly fatherland, perform with Christ's
aid this Rule written out as the least beginnings; and then at

things that we have mentioned—to the summits of teaching

The following <hi rend='italic'>formulæ</hi> are given to illustrate the Rule in its
working. The first group bear upon the vow of <hi rend='italic'>stabilitas loci</hi>.
The case not infrequently arose that a brother wished to go
to a monastery in which the observance of the Rule was
stricter. In case a new foundation was begun anywhere, the
first monks were almost always from another monastery. If
therefore the monk is to remove, he must obtain permission of
his abbot, and this was not regarded as a violation of the vow
of <hi rend='italic'>stabilitas loci</hi> and obedience to his abbot. These
<hi rend='italic'>formulæ</hi> were not uniform throughout the Church, but the following
are given as samples of early practice.

</p>

<p>
I, a humble abbot. You should know, beloved, that this

to dwell with you. And, because we know that you
observe the Rule of the order, we assent to his dwelling with

you. I now commend him to you, that you may treat him
as I would, and for him you are to render an account to God

(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) From Peter Boherius, <hi rend='italic'>Commentary on the
Regula S. Benedicti</hi>, ch. 58 of the Rule, <hi rend='italic'>v. supra</hi>.
</p>

<p>
When the novice makes his solemn profession, the abbot
vests to say mass, and after the offertory the abbot interrogates
him saying:
</p>

<p>
Brother (such a one): Is it your will to renounce the world
and all its pomps?
</p>

<p>
He answers: It is.
</p>

<p>
Abbot: Will you promise obedience according to the Rule
of St. Benedict? Answer: I will.
</p>

<p>
Abbot: May God give you his aid.
</p>

<p>
Then the novice, or some one at his request, reads the aforesaid
profession, and when it has been read he places it upon
his head, and then upon the altar. After this, when he has
prostrated himself on his knees in four directions in the form
of a cross, he says the verse: Receive me, O Lord, etc. And
then the <hi rend='italic'>Gloria Patri</hi>,
the <hi rend='italic'>Kyrie Eleison</hi>, the <hi rend='italic'>Pater Noster</hi>
and the Litany are said, the novice remaining prostrate on the
ground before the altar, until the end of the mass. And the
brothers ought to be in the choir kneeling while the Litany
is said. When the Litany has been said, then shall follow very
devoutly the special prayers as commanded by the Fathers,
and immediately after the communion and before the prayer
is said, the garments of the novice, which have been folded
and placed before the altar, shall be blessed with their proper
prayers; and they shall be anointed and sprinkled with holy
water by the abbot. After <q><hi rend='italic'>Ite, missa est</hi></q><note
place="foot">The conclusion of the mass.</note> the novice rises
from the ground, and having put off his old garments which
were not blessed he puts on those which have been blessed,
while the abbot recites: <hi rend='italic'>Exuat te Dominus</hi>, etc.
</p>

<pb n='644'/><anchor id='Pg644'/>

<p>
And when the kiss has been given by the abbot, all the
brothers in turn give him the kiss of peace, and he shall keep
silence for three days continuously after this, going about
with his head covered and receiving the communion every day.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) From Theodore of Canterbury, <hi rend='italic'>ibid.</hi>,
827.
</p>

<p>
In the ordination of monks the abbot ought to say mass,
and say three prayers over the head of the novice; and for
seven days he veils his head with his cowl, and on the seventh
day the abbot takes the veil off.

<head>§ 105. Foundation of Mediæval Culture and Schools</head>

<p>
Schools never wholly disappeared from Western society,
either during the barbarian invasion or in the even more
troublous times that followed. Secular schools continued
throughout the fifth century. During the sixth century they
gave way for the most part to schools fostered by the Church,
or were thoroughly transformed by ecclesiastical influences.
In the fifth and sixth centuries, the great compends were made
that served as text-books for centuries. Boethius, Cassiodorus,
Isidore of Seville, and Bede represent great steps in the
preparation for the mediæval schools. But, apart from the
survival of old schools, there was a real demand for the establishment
of new schools. The new monasticism needed
them. It required some reading and study every day by
the monks. As children were constantly being received, ordinarily
at the age of seven, these <hi rend='italic'>oblati</hi> needed instruction.
The monastic schools, which thus arose, early made provision
for the instruction of those not destined for the monastic life
in the external schools of the monasteries. Then again, the
need of clergy with some literary training, however simple,
<pb n='645'/><anchor id='Pg645'/>
was felt, especially as the secular schools declined or were
found not convenient, and conciliar action was taken in various
countries to provide for such education. In the conversion
of the English, schools seem very early to have been
established, and the encouragement given these schools by the
learned Theodore of Tarsus, archbishop of Canterbury, bore
splendid fruit, not merely in the great school of Canterbury
but still more in the monastic schools of the North, at Jarrow
and Wearmouth and at York. It was from the schools in
the North that the culture of the Frankish kingdom under
Charles the Great largely came. There was always a marked
difference of opinion as to the value of secular literature in
education, as is shown by the attitude already taken by Gregory
the Great in his letter to Desiderius of Vienne, a letter
which did much to discourage the literary study of the classics.

The Christian's use of heathen writers.
</quote>

<quote rend="display">
The whole book should be examined carefully to see the working out
of the same idea in detail. St. Augustine was a man of literary culture,
although he was imperfectly acquainted with Greek. He speaks
from his own experience of the help he had derived from this culture.
The work <hi rend='italic'>On Christian Doctrine</hi> is, in fact, not
at all a treatise on theology but on pedagogy, and was of immense influence

<p>
If those who are called philosophers and especially the Platonists
have said anything true and in harmony with the faith,
we ought not only not to shrink from it, but rather to appropriate
it for our own use, taking it from them as from unlawful
possessors. For as the Egyptians had not only the idols
and heavy burdens, which the people of Israel hated and fled
from, but also vessels and ornaments of gold and silver and
clothing which the same people on going out of Egypt secretly
appropriated to themselves as for a better use, not on
their own authority but on the command of God, for the
Egyptians in their ignorance lent those things which they
<pb n='646'/><anchor id='Pg646'/>
themselves were not using well [Ex. 3:22; 12:35]; in the
same way all branches of heathen learning have not only
false and superstitious fancies and heavy burdens of unnecessary
toil which each of us, in going out under the leadership
of Christ from the fellowship of the heathen, ought to
hate and avoid; but they contain also liberal instruction
which it is well to adapt to the use of truth and some most
useful precepts of morality; and some truths in regard even
to the worship of the one God are found among them. Now
these are, so to speak, their gold and silver, which they themselves
did not create, but dug, as it were, out of certain
mines of God's providence, which are everywhere scattered
abroad, and are perversely and unlawfully misused to the
worship of devils. These, therefore, the Christian, when he
separates himself in spirit from the miserable fellowship of
these men, ought to take away from them for their proper
use in preaching the Gospel. Their clothing also, that is,
human institutions, adapted to that intercourse with men
which is indispensable for this life, it is right to take and to
have so as to be turned to Christian use.

Ch. 33. We also saw the abbot Theodore, a man endowed
with the utmost holiness and with perfect knowledge not only
of things of the practical life but also of the meaning of the
Scriptures, which he had acquired, not so much by study and
reading, or secular scholarship, as by purity of heart alone;
<pb n='647'/><anchor id='Pg647'/>
since he was able only with difficulty to understand or speak
even but a few words in the Greek language. This man, when
he was seeking an explanation of some most difficult question,
continued indefatigably seven days and nights in prayer

Ch. 34. This man, therefore, when some of the brethren
were wondering at the splendid light of his knowledge, and
were asking him some meanings of Scripture, said: <q>A monk
desiring to attain to a knowledge of the Scriptures ought in
no wise to spend his labor on the books of the commentators,
but rather to keep all the efforts of his mind and the intentions
of his heart set on purification from carnal vices. When
these are driven out, at once the eyes of the heart, when the
veil of passions has been removed, will begin, as it were, naturally
to gaze on the mysteries of Scripture, since these were
not declared unto us by the grace of the Holy Ghost to remain
unknown and obscure; but they are rendered obscure by our
vices, as the veil of our sins cover the eyes of the heart, and
for these, when restored to their natural health, the mere
reading of Holy Scripture is amply sufficient for the perception
of the true knowledge; nor do they need the instruction
of commentators, just as these eyes of flesh need no
man's assistance to see provided they are free from the dimness
or darkness of blindness.</q>

<head>Chapter IV. The Revolution In The Ecclesiastical And Political Situation Due To The
Rise Of Islam And The Doctrinal Disputes In The Eastern Church</head>

<p>
In the course of the seventh and eighth centuries, the ecclesiastical
and political situation altered completely. This
change was due, in the first place, to the rise of the religion
and empire of the Moslems, whereby a very large part of the
Eastern Empire was conquered by the followers of the Prophet,
who had rapidly extended their conquests over Syria and the
best African provinces. Reduced in extent and exposed to
ever fresh attacks from a powerful enemy, the Eastern Empire
had to face new political problems. In the second place, as
the provinces overrun contained the greater number of those
dissatisfied with the doctrinal results of the great councils,
the apparently interminable contests over the question as
to the two natures of Christ came to an unexpected end.
This did not take place until a new cause for dispute had arisen
among the adherents of Chalcedon, due to an attempt to win
back the Monophysites by accounting for the unity of the person
of Christ by positing one will in Jesus. Monotheletism at
once became among the adherents of Chalcedon a burning question.
It was finally condemned at the Sixth General Council,
Constantinople, A. D. 683, at which Pope Agatho played a part
very similar to that played by Pope Leo at Chalcedon, but at
the cost of seeing his predecessor, Honorius, condemned as a
Monothelete. It was the last triumph of the West in the dogmatic
controversies of the East. The Eastern ecclesiastics,
irritated at the diplomatic triumph of Rome, expressed their
resentment at the Concilium Quinisextum, in 692, where, in
passing canons to complete the work of the Fifth and Sixth
Councils, an opportunity was embraced of expressly condemning
several Roman practices. In the confusion resulting in
the next century from the attempt of Leo the Isaurian to put
<pb n='653'/><anchor id='Pg653'/>
an end to the use of images in the churches, the Roman see
was able to rid itself of the nominal control which the Emperor
still had over the papacy by means of the exarchate of Ravenna.
When the Lombards pressed too heavily upon the papacy
it was easy for the Bishop of Rome to make an alliance with
the Franks, who on their side saw that it was profitable to
employ the papacy in the advancement of their own schemes.
In this way arose that alliance between the pontiff and the
new Frankish monarchy upon which the ecclesiastical development
of the Middle Ages rests. But Iconoclasm suffered
defeat at the Seventh General Council, 787, in which the
doctrinal system of the East was completed. As this was the
last undisputed general council, it may be taken as marking
the termination of the history of the ancient Church. In
following the further course of the Western Church there is
no longer need of a detailed tracing of the history of the
Eastern Church, which ceased to be a determining factor in
the religious life of the West. The two parts of Christendom
come in contact from time to time, but without formal schism
they have ceased to be organically united.

<head>§ 106. The Rise and Extension of Islam</head>

<p>
Mohammed (571-632) began his work as a prophet at
Mecca about 613, having been <q>called</q> about three years
earlier. He was driven from Mecca in 622 and fled to Yathrib,
afterward known as Medina. Here he was able to unite warring
factions and, placing himself at their head, to build up
<pb n='654'/><anchor id='Pg654'/>
despotic authority over the surrounding country. He steadily
increased the territory under his sway, and by conquests and
diplomacy was able to gain Mecca in 629. Before his death
in 632 he had conquered all Arabia. His authority continued
in his family after his death, and the course of conquest went
on. Damascus was conquered in 635; in 636 the Emperor
Heraclius was driven to abandon Syria, which now fell into
the hands of the Moslems. In 637 the Persians were forced
back. In 640 Egypt was taken, and by 650 all between Carthage
and the eastern border of Persia had been acquired for
Islam. In 693, after a period of civil war, the work of conquest
was resumed. In 709 all the African coast as far as
the Straits of Gibraltar was gained, and in 711 the Moslems
entered Spain. They at once made themselves masters of
the peninsula with the exception of a small strip in the north
in the mountains of Asturias, the kingdom of Gallicia. Crossing
the Pyrenees, they attempted to possess Gaul, but were
forced to retreat from central Gaul by Charles Martel at the
battle at Tours and Poitiers in 732. They maintained themselves
north of the Pyrenees until 759 when they were driven
out of Narbonne and across the mountains.

the thunderbolt caught them in their injustice. Then they
took a calf, after what had come to them of manifest signs;

Ch. 46. At that time [A. D. 711] the people of the Saracens,
crossing over from Africa at a place which is called
Ceuta, invaded all Spain. Then after ten years, coming with
their wives and children, they invaded as if to settle in
Aquitania, a province of Gaul. Charles<note place="foot">Charles

an agreement and fought with perfect harmony against the
Saracens. For the Franks fell upon them<note place="foot">A. D. 732,
Battle of Tours and Poitiers.</note> and slew three
hundred and seventy-five thousand of them; but on the side
of the Franks only fifteen hundred fell. Eudo with his men
broke into their camp and slew many and laid waste all.

<p>
Ch. 47. At the same time [A. D. 717], the same people of
the Saracens with an immense army came and encompassed
Constantinople and for three years besieged it until, when
the people had called upon God with great earnestness, many
of the enemy perished from hunger and cold and by war and
pestilence and so wearied out they abandoned the siege.
When they had left they carried on war against the people of
the Bulgarians who were beyond the Danube, but, vanquished
by them also, they fled back to their ships. But when they
had put out to the deep sea, a sudden storm fell upon them
and many were drowned and their vessels were destroyed.

<head>§ 107. The Monothelete Controversy and the Sixth General Council, Constantinople
A. D. 681</head>

<p>
The Monothelete controversy was the natural outcome of
the earlier Christological controversies. With the assertion
of the two complete and persisting natures of Christ, the question
must sooner or later arise as to whether there was one will
or two in Christ. If there were two wills, it seemed to lead
back to Nestorianism; if there was but one, either the humanity
was incomplete or the position led to virtual monophysitism.
But political causes played even a greater part than
the theological dialectic. The Emperor Heraclius, in attempting
to win back the Monophysite churches, on account of the
war with Persia and later on account of the advancing Moslems,
proposed that a union should be effected on the basis of
a formula which asserted that there was but one will in the
God-man. This had been suggested to him in 622 by
Sergius, patriarch of Constantinople [Hefele, §§ 291, 295].
In 633 Cyrus of Phasis, since 630 patriarch of Alexandria,
brought about a union between the Orthodox Church and the
Egyptian Monophysites on the basis of a Monothelete formula,
<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, a statement that there was but one will or energy
in Christ. At once a violent controversy broke out. The
formula was supported by Honorius of Rome, but attacked
by Sophronius, patriarch of Jerusalem, and after the fall of
Jerusalem in 638, by the monk Maximus Confessor. In 638
Heraclius tried to end the controversy by an <hi rend='italic'>Ecthesis</hi>
[<hi rend='italic'>Hefele</hi>, § 299], and Constans II
(641-668) attempted the same in 648, by his <hi rend='italic'>Typos</hi>.
But at the Lateran Council of 649, under Martin I, Monotheletism
as well as the <hi rend='italic'>Ecthesis</hi> and <hi rend='italic'>Typos</hi>
were condemned. For this Martin was ultimately banished, dying in
misery, 654, in the Chersonesus, and Maximus, after a long,
cruel imprisonment, and horrible torture and mutilation, died
in exile, 662. But Constantius Pogonatus (668-685), the successor
of Constans II, determined to settle the matter by a
<pb n='661'/><anchor id='Pg661'/>
general council. Pope Agatho (678-682) thereupon held a
great council at Rome, 679, at which it was decided to insist
at the coming general council upon the strictest maintenance
of the decisions of the Roman Council of 649. On this basis
Agatho dictated the formula which was accepted by the Council
of Constantinople, A. D. 681, which sent its proceedings and
conclusions to the Pope to be approved. Along with them was
an express condemnation of Honorius. Leo II (682-683),
Agatho's successor, approved the council with special mention
of Honorius as condemned for his heresy.

The author of this formula, known also as Cyrus of Phasis, under
which name he was condemned at Constantinople, A. D. 680, attempted
to win over the Monophysites in Alexandria and met with great success
on account of his formula of union. The first five anathemas,
the form in which the formula is composed, are clearly based upon the
first four councils. The sixth is slightly different; and the seventh, the
most important, is clearly tending toward Monotheletism. The document
is to be found in the proceedings of the Sixth General Council in
Mansi, and also in Hardouin. For a synopsis, see Hefele, § 293, who

and viewing these in the mind as remaining unchanged, unalterable,
and unmixed after their union according to nature

separation the one and the same Christ and Son, inasmuch as
he regards in his mind two as brought together to each other
without commingling, making the theory of them as a matter
of fact, but not by a lying imagination and vain combinations
of the mind; but in nowise separating them, since now
the division into two has been destroyed on account of the
indescribable and incomprehensible union; saying with the
holy Athanasius, for there is now flesh and again the flesh of
God the Word, now flesh animated and intelligent, and again
the flesh of the animated and intelligent God the Word; but
should under such expressions understand a distinction into

Jesus Christ assert that there is only one will, and that
one and the same affects both the divine and human deeds;

views by asserting that our Lord Jesus Christ was only one
person in two natures, and therefore without confusion or
separation, working and willing as well the divine as the human

two natures are joined without any separation, so their
differences from each other remain, and according to the character
of each nature one and the same Christ works as well

rank, be subjected to corporal punishment and perpetual exile.

<p>
The holy, great, and ecumenical synod assembled by the
grace of God and the religious decree of the most religious,
faithful, and mighty Emperor Constantine, in this God-preserved
and royal city of Constantinople, New Rome, in the hall
of the imperial palace called Trullus, has decreed as follows:
</p>

<p>
The only begotten Son and Word of God the Father, who
was made man, like unto us in all things, without sin, Christ
our true God, has declared expressly in the words of the Gospel:
<q>I am the light of the world; he that followeth Me shall
not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life</q> [John
8:12]; and again: <q>My peace I leave with you, My peace I
give unto you</q> [John 14:27]. Our most gracious Emperor,
the champion of orthodoxy and opponent of evil doctrine,
being reverentially led by this divinely uttered doctrine of
peace, and having assembled this our holy and ecumenical
synod, has united the judgment of the whole Church. Wherefore
this our holy and ecumenical synod, having driven away
the impious error which has prevailed for a certain time until
now, and following closely the straight path of the holy and
approved Fathers, has piously given its assent to the five holy
and ecumenical synods—that is to say, to that of the three
hundred and eighteen holy Fathers assembled at Nicæa
against the insane Arius; and the next at Constantinople of
the one hundred and fifty God-inspired men against Macedonius,
the adversary of the Spirit, and the impious Apollinaris;
and also the first at Ephesus of two hundred venerable
men assembled against Nestorius, the Judaizer; and that in
Chalcedon of six hundred and thirty God-inspired Fathers
against Eutyches and Dioscurus, hated of God; and in addition
to these the last, that is the fifth, holy synod assembled in
this place against Theodore of Mopsuestia, Origen, Didymus,
and Evagrius, and the writings of Theodoret against the
twelve chapters of the celebrated Cyril, and the epistle which
was said to have been written by Ibas to Maris the Persian—without
alteration this synod renews in all points the ancient
decrees of religion, chasing away the impious doctrines of
<pb n='667'/><anchor id='Pg667'/>
irreligion. And this our holy and ecumenical synod, inspired
of God, has set its seal to the creed of the three hundred and
eighteen Fathers, and again religiously confirmed by the one
hundred and fifty, which also the other holy synods gladly
received and ratified for the removal of every soul-destroying
heresy.

<p>
The holy and ecumenical synod further says that this pious
and orthodox creed of the divine grace would be sufficient for
the full knowledge and confirmation of the orthodox faith.
But as the author of evil, who in the beginning availed himself
of the aid of the serpent, and by it brought the poison of
death upon the human race, has not desisted, but in like manner
now, having found suitable instruments for the accomplishment
of his will—that is to say, Theodorus, who was bishop of
Pharan; Sergius, Pyrrhus, Paul and Peter, who were prelates
of this royal city; and also Honorius, who was pope of Old
Rome; Cyrus, bishop of Alexandria, Marcarius, lately bishop
of Antioch, and Stephen, his disciple—has not ceased with their
<pb n='668'/><anchor id='Pg668'/>
declaration of orthodoxy by this our God-assembled and holy
synod; for according to the sentence spoken of God: <q>Where
two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in
the midst of them</q> [Matt. 18:20], the present<note place="foot">From
here text in Denziger.</note> holy and ecumenical
synod, faithfully receiving and saluting with uplifted
hands also the suggestion which by the most holy and blessed
Pope Agatho, Pope of Old Rome, was sent to our most pious
and faithful Emperor Constantine, which rejected by name
those who taught or preached one will and operation in the
dispensation of the incarnation of Christ<note place="foot">Latin
reads: <hi rend='italic'>our Lord Jesus Christ</hi>.</note> our very God, has
likewise adopted that other synodal suggestion which was sent
by the council held under the same most holy Pope, composed
of one hundred and twenty-five bishops beloved of
God,<note place="foot">For this council, see Hefele, § 314.</note> to
his God-instructed tranquillity [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the Emperor], as consonant
to the holy Council of Chalcedon and the <hi rend='italic'>Tome</hi> of the
most holy and blessed Leo, Pope of the same Old Rome, which
was directed to the holy Flavian, which also the council
called the pillar of a right faith; and also agrees with the
synodical letters written by the blessed Cyril against the
impious Nestorius and addressed to the Oriental bishops.
</p>

<p>
Following<note place="foot">From here the text may be found also in Hahn, § 150.</note>
the five holy and ecumenical synods and the
most holy and approved Fathers, with one voice defining that
our Lord Jesus Christ must be confessed to be our very God,
one of the holy and consubstantial and life-giving Trinity,
perfect in deity and the same perfect in humanity, truly God
and truly man, of a reasonable soul and body; consubstantial
with His Father as to His godhead, and consubstantial with us
as to His manhood; in all things like unto us, without sin
[Heb. 4:15]; begotten of His Father before the ages according
to His godhead, but in these last days for us men and for
our salvation begotten of the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin
Mary, strictly and in truth Theotokos, according to the flesh;
one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only begotten, in two
<pb n='669'/><anchor id='Pg669'/>
natures unconfusedly, unchangeably, inseparably, indivisibly
to be recognized; the peculiarities of neither nature lost
by the union, but rather the properties of each nature preserved,
concurring in one person,<note place="foot"><foreign
lang="el" rend="font-style: italic">Prosopon</foreign>, and so throughout.</note>
and in one subsistence,<note place="foot"><foreign lang="el"
rend="font-style: italic">Hypostasis</foreign>, and so throughout.</note>
not parted or divided into two persons, but one and the same
only begotten Son, the Word of God,<note place="foot">Latin:
<hi rend='italic'>God the Word</hi>.</note> the Lord Jesus Christ,
according as the prophets of old have taught, and as Jesus
Christ Himself hath taught, and the creed of the holy Fathers
hath delivered to us;<note place="foot">The preceding is but a
recapitulation of Chalcedon; see above, <ref target="Section_90">§ 90</ref>.</note>
we likewise declare that in Him are
two natural wills or willings and two natural operations indivisibly,
unchangeably, inseparably, unconfusedly, according
to the teaching of the holy Fathers. And these two natural
wills are not contrary one to the other (which God forbid), as
the impious heretics say, but His human will follows, not as
resisting or reluctant, but rather therefore as subject to His
divine and omnipotent will. For it was right that the will
of the flesh should be moved, but be subject to the divine will,
according to the most wise Athanasius. For as His flesh is
called and is the flesh of God the Word, so also the natural
will of His flesh is called and is the proper will of God the Word,
as He Himself says: <q>I came down from heaven, not to do
Mine own will, but the will of the Father which sent Me,</q> [John
6:38], wherein he calls His own will the will of the flesh,
inasmuch as His flesh was also His own. For as His most
holy and immaculately animated flesh was not destroyed because
it was deified [θεωθεῖσα], but continued in its own state
and nature, so also His human will, although deified, was not
taken away, but rather was preserved according to the saying
of Gregory the Theologian:<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>I.e.</hi>,
Gregory Nazianzus.</note> <q>His will, namely that of the
Saviour, is not contrary to God, but altogether deified.</q>
</p>

<p>
We glorify two natural operations, indivisibly, unchangeably,
inseparably, unconfusedly, in the same our Lord Jesus
Christ, our true God, that is to say, a divine operation and a
<pb n='670'/><anchor id='Pg670'/>
human operation, according to the divine preacher Leo, who
most distinctly says as follows: <q>For each form does in communion
with the other what pertains to it, namely the Word
doing what pertains to the Word, and the flesh what pertains
to the flesh.</q><note place="foot">Leo, <hi rend='italic'>Ep. ad
Flavianum</hi>, ch. 4: Agit enim utraque forma cum alterius communione
quod proprium est, Verbo scilicet operante quod Verbi est, et carne
exsequente quod carnis est; unum horum coruscat miraculis, aliud succumbit
iniuriis; <hi rend='italic'>v. supra</hi>,
<ref target="Section_90_b">§ 90, <hi rend='italic'>b</hi></ref>.</note>
For we will not admit one natural operation
of God and of the creature, that we may not exalt into the
divine essence what is created, nor will we bring down the
glory of the divine nature to the place suited for those things
which have been made. We recognize the miracles and the
sufferings as of one and the same person, but of one or of the
other nature of which He is, and in which He has His existence,
as the admirable Cyril said. Preserving in all respects,
therefore, the unconfusedness and indivisibility, we express
all in brief phrase: Believing that our Lord Jesus Christ, one
of the Trinity also after the incarnation, is our true God, we
say that His two natures shone forth in His one subsistence
[hypostasis], in which were both the miracles and the suffering
throughout the whole incarnate life,<note place="foot">Greek:
<hi rend='italic'>economic life</hi>.</note> not in appearance merely
but in reality, the difference as to nature being recognized
in one and the same subsistence; for, although joined together,
each nature wills and operates the things proper to it.<note
place="foot">Latin adds: <hi rend='italic'>indivisibly and unconfusedly</hi>.</note>
For this reason we glorify two natural<note place="foot">Here, as
elsewhere, <q>natural will</q> means such a will as belongs to a
nature, divine or human.</note> wills and operations concurring
most fitly in Him for the salvation of the human race.
</p>

<p>
Since these things have been formulated by us with all
diligence and care, we decree that to no one shall it be permitted
to bring forward or write or to compose or to think
or to teach otherwise. Whosoever shall presume to compose
a different faith or to propose, or to teach, or to hand to those
wishing to be converted to the knowledge of the truth from
the heathen or the Jews or from any heresy any different symbol,
or to introduce a new mode of expression to subvert
<pb n='671'/><anchor id='Pg671'/>
these things which have now been determined by us, all these,
if they be bishops or clergy, shall be deposed, the bishops from
the episcopate, the clergy from the clerical office; but if they
be monks or laymen, they shall be anathematized.

The condemnation of the Monotheletes, including Honorius of Rome.
</quote>

<quote rend="display">
The condemnation of Honorius has become a <hi rend='italic'>cause célèbre</hi>,
especially in connection with the doctrine of papal infallibility. It should
be observed, however, that the doctrine of papal infallibility, as defined
at the Vatican Council, A. D. 1870 (<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Mirbt, n. 509), requires
that only when the Pope speaks <hi rend='italic'>ex cathedra</hi> is he infallible,
and it has not been shown that any opinion whatever held by Honorius was
an <hi rend='italic'>ex cathedra</hi> definition of faith and morals according to
the Vatican Council. The matter is therefore a mere question of fact and may be
treated apart from the Vatican dogma. It should be borne in mind,
further, that the Sixth General Council was approved by Pope Leo II,
A. D. 682 (<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Mirbt, n. 189), who included Honorius by name among
those whose condemnation was approved. That he did so approve
it is also stated in the <hi rend='italic'>Liber Pontificalis</hi>
(<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Mirbt, n. 190), and according to the
<hi rend='italic'>Liber Diurnus</hi>, the official book of formulæ used in
the papal business, the Pope took an oath recognizing among others
the Sixth General Council, and condemning Honorius among other
heretics (<hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> Mirbt, n. 191). That Honorius was actually
a heretic is still another matter; for it seems not at all unlikely that he misunderstood
the point at issue and his language is quite unscientific. The
text of the letters of Honorius may be found in Kirch, nn. 949-965, and
in Hefele in a translation, §§ 296, 298. On the condemnation of Honorius,
see Hefele, § 324.

<p>
The holy council said: After we had reconsidered, according
to our promise made to your highness,<note place="foot">The Emperor

written by Sergius, at one time patriarch of this royal God-preserved
city, to Cyrus, who was then bishop of Phasis,
and to Honorius, sometime Pope of Old Rome, as well as the
letter of the latter to the same Sergius, and finding that the
documents are quite foreign to the apostolic dogmas, to the
definitions of the holy councils, and to all the approved Fathers,
and that they follow the false teachings of the heretics, we
entirely reject them, and execrate them as hurtful to the soul.
</p>

<pb n='672'/><anchor id='Pg672'/>

<p>
But the names of those men whom we execrate must also be
thrust forth from the holy Church of God, namely, that of
Sergius, sometime bishop of this God-preserved royal city,
who was the first to write on this impious doctrine; also that
of Cyrus of Alexandria, of Pyrrhus, Paul, and Peter, who died
bishops of this God-preserved city, and were like-minded with
them; and that of Theodore, sometime bishop of Pharan, all
of whom the most holy and thrice-blessed Agatho, Pope of
Old Rome, in his suggestion to our most pious and God-preserved
lord and mighty Emperor, rejected because they were
minded contrary to our orthodox faith, all of whom we declare
are subject to anathema. And with these we decree
that there shall be expelled from the holy Church of God and
anathematized Honorius, who was Pope of Old Rome, because
of what we found written by him to Sergius, that in all
respects he followed his view and confirmed his impious doctrine.
</p>

<p>
We have also examined the synodal letter<note place="foot">The most
important parts of this are to be found in Hahn, § 235.</note> of Sophronius,
of holy memory, sometime patriarch of the holy city of our
God, Jerusalem, and have found it in accordance with the
true faith and with apostolic teachings, and with the teachings
of the holy and approved Fathers. Therefore, we have
received it as orthodox and salutary to the holy and Catholic
and Apostolic Church, and have decreed that it is right that
his name be inserted in the diptychs of the holy churches.

<head>§ 108. Rome, Constantinople, and the Lombard State Church in the Seventh
Century</head>

<p>
The Sixth General Council was the last great diplomatic
triumph of Rome in the East in matters of faith, though two
centuries after, in the matter of Photius, Rome played a brilliant
part in the internal affairs of the Eastern Church. Immediately
after the council of 681, it was felt that the West,
of which the Greeks had grown very jealous, had triumphed
<pb n='673'/><anchor id='Pg673'/>
over the East, especially as several of the leading patriarchs
had been condemned. Monotheletism, furthermore, was too
strongly intrenched in the East to be removed by a single
conciliar action. It was felt necessary to take action to confirm
the results of Constantinople in 681. The fifth and
sixth general councils had been occupied entirely with doctrinal
matters and had not issued any disciplinary canons.
A new council might be gathered to complete the work of the
Sixth General Council, not only to reaffirm it, but in connection
with some much-needed legislation to retort upon the
West by condemning some Roman practices. In this way
the Second Trullan Council, or Concilium Quinisextum, came
about in 692. The Roman see, in the meanwhile, although it
had triumphed at Constantinople in 681, did not enjoy an
independent political position in Italy. It was still under the
Roman Emperor at Constantinople, as had been most painfully
perceived in the treatment of Martin I by Constans.
Although the Pope had his apocrisiarius, or nuncio, at Constantinople,
he came into immediate contact with the exarch
of Ravenna, the Emperor's representative in Italy. In Italy,
furthermore, the Arian heresy long persisted among the Lombards,
although greater toleration was shown the Catholic
Church.

This council was commonly regarded as the continuation of the

separate council, but as a part of the sixth. The West has never accepted
this opinion and has only to a limited extent admitted the authority
of its canons, though some have been current in the West because,
like much conciliar action, they were re-enactments of older
canons. Occasionally some of the canons have been cited by popes

Also we agree to guard untouched the faith of the Sixth
Holy Synod, which first assembled in this royal city in the time
of Constantine, our Emperor, of blessed memory, which faith
received still greater confirmation from the fact that the pious
Emperor ratified with his own signet what was written, for
the security of every future age. And again we confess that
we should guard the faith unaltered and openly acknowledged;
that in the Economy of the incarnation of our one Lord Jesus
Christ, the true God, there are two natural wills or volitions
and two natural operations; and have condemned by a just
sentence those who adulterated the true doctrine and taught
the people that in the one Lord, our God, Jesus Christ, there is
but one will and operation, that is to say, Theodore of Pharan,
Cyrus of Alexandria, Honorius of Rome, Sergius, Pyrrhus,
Paul, and Peter, who were bishops of this God-preserved city,
Macarius, who was bishop of Antioch, Stephen who was his
disciple, and the insane Polychronius, depriving them henceforth

<head>Canon 2. <hi rend='italic'>On the Sources of Canon Law.</hi></head>

<quote rend="display">
This canon opposed Rome in two respects: it accepted eighty-five
Apostolic Canons, whereas Rome received but fifty; it drew up a list
of councils and of Fathers whose writings should have authority as
canons, and omitted the important Western councils, except Carthage,
and all the papal decrees. With this canon should be compared the
decretal of Gelasius, <hi rend='italic'>De Libris Recipiendis,

<p>
It has also seemed good to this holy synod that the eighty-five
canons received and ratified by the holy and blessed
<pb n='675'/><anchor id='Pg675'/>
Fathers before us, and also handed down to us in the name of
the holy and glorious Apostles, should from this time forth
remain firm and unshaken for the cure of souls and the healing
of disorders. And since in these canons we are bidden to
receive the <hi rend='italic'>Constitutions of the Holy Apostles</hi> by Clement,
in which, in old time, certain spurious matter entirely contrary
to piety was introduced by heterodox persons for the polluting
of the Church, which obscures to us the elegance and
beauty of the divine decrees; we, therefore, for the edification
and security of the most Christian flock, reject properly such
constitutions; by no means admitting the offspring of heretical
error, and cleaving to the pure and perfect doctrine of the
Apostles. But we set our seal likewise upon all the other
holy canons set forth by our holy and blessed Fathers, that is,
by the three hundred and eighteen God-fearing Fathers
assembled at Nicæa, and those at Ancyra; further, those at
Neo-Cæsarea and at Gangra, and besides these those at Antioch
in Syria [A. D. 341], those too at Laodicea in Phrygia,
and likewise those of the one hundred and fifty assembled
in this God-preserved imperial city and of the two hundred,
who assembled for the first time in the metropolis of the
Ephesians, and of the six hundred and thirty holy and blessed
Fathers at Chalcedon; in like manner those of Sardica and
those of Carthage; those also who assembled in this God-preserved
imperial city under Nectarius [A. D. 394], and under
Theophilus, archbishop of Alexandria; likewise too the
canons<note place="foot">Decretal letters.</note>
of Dionysius, formerly archbishop of the great city
of Alexandria, and of Peter, archbishop of Alexandria, and
martyr; of Gregory the Wonder-worker, archbishop of Neo-Cæsarea;

moreover the canons set forth by Cyprian, archbishop of the
country of the Africans, and martyr, and by the synod under
him,<note place="foot">Probably that of 256.</note>
which have been kept in the country of the aforesaid
bishops and only according to the custom delivered down to
them. And that no one be allowed to transgress the aforesaid
canons, or to receive other canons besides them, supposititiously
set forth by some who have attempted to make a traffic of

The following canon permits subdeacons and priests if married
before ordination to continue to live in marriage relations with their
wives. But they are not allowed to marry a second time or to marry a
widow. Neither are bishops to remain married; but if they are married
when elected, their wives must enter a monastery at a distance.
With this canon should be compared the earlier legislation of Nicæa, <hi rend='italic'>v.

<p>
Since we know that it is handed down in the canonical discipline
in the Roman Church that those who are about to be
deemed worthy of ordination to the diaconate or presbyterate
should promise no longer to live maritally with their wives,
we, pursuing the ancient rule of apostolic discipline and order,

remain firm, by no means dissolving their union with their
wives, nor depriving them of intercourse with each other at a
convenient season.… Therefore, if any one shall have
dared, contrary to the Apostolic Canons, to deprive any one
in holy orders, that is, any presbyter, deacon, or subdeacon,
of cohabitation and intercourse with his lawful wife, let him
be deposed; likewise also if any presbyter or deacon, on pretence
of piety, puts away his wife, let him be excluded from

<p>
Since at different times there have been invasions of the
barbarians, and consequently very many cities have come into
the possession of the infidels, so that as a consequence the
prelate of a city may not be able, after he has been ordained,
to take possession of his see and to be settled in it in sacerdotal
order, and so to perform and manage, according to custom,
the ordinations and all other things which appertain to the
bishop; we, preserving the honor and veneration of the priesthood,
and in nowise wishing to make use of the heathen
injury to the ruin of ecclesiastical rights, have decreed that
they who have been thus ordained, and for the aforesaid
causes have not settled in their sees, may be kept from any
prejudice from this thing, so that they may canonically perform
the ordination of the different clerics and use the authority
of their offices according to proper limits, and that whatever
administration proceeds from them may be valid and

The <hi rend='italic'>Liber Diurnus</hi> was the book of official formulæ
used on occasions such as elections of pontiffs and the conferring of the
pallium. It was composed between 685 and 751, and was employed in the papal
chancellery down to the eleventh century, when it became antiquated on
account of the changes in the position of the popes. The modern
editions of the book are by Rozière, Paris, 1869, and by Sickel, Vienna,

Although it has not been without the merciful divine ordering
that, after the death of the supreme pontiff, the votes of
all should agree in the election of one, and that there be perfect
harmony so that no one at all is to be found who would
oppose it, it is yet necessary that we ought obediently to pour
forth the prayers of our petitions to our most serene and most

and graciously to grant what has been asked by them in
unanimity. And so when our Pope (<hi rend='italic'>name</hi>) of most blessed

to the election of (<hi rend='italic'>name</hi>), the venerable archdeacon of the

served the same church, and in all things shown himself so
able that he ought deservedly to be placed, with the divine

by his constant association with the aforesaid most blessed
pontiff (<hi rend='italic'>name</hi>), he has been able to attain to the same
distinctions of so great merit, by which the same prelate of holy
memory is known to have been adorned, who by his words
always stirred up his mind, being desirous of heavenly joys,
so that whatsoever good we have lost in his predecessor we
are confident that we have certainly found in him. Therefore,

may deign to hear the supplication of their servants, and the
desires of their petitioners may be granted by the command
of their piety, for the benefit of the Empire, that command
may be given for his ordination; so that when we have been
placed by your sacred and exalted clemency under him as our

<p>
Inasmuch as (<hi rend='italic'>name</hi>), of pontifical memory, has been called
from present cares to eternal rest, as is the lot of mortals, a
great load of sorrow oppressed us, for as guardians we were
deprived of our own guardian. But the accustomed kindness
of our God did not permit us to remain long in this affliction
because we hoped in Him. For after we had humbly spent
three days in prayer that the heavenly kindness might, for
the merits of all, make known whom as worthy it commanded
to be elected to succeed to the apostolic office, with the aid
of His grace which inspired the minds of all; and after we had
assembled as is customary, that is, the clergy and the people
of Rome with the presence of the nobility and the army, from
the least to the greatest, so to speak; and the election, with
the help of God and the aid of the holy Apostles, fell upon the
person of (<hi rend='italic'>name</hi>), the most holy archdeacon of this holy Apostolic
See of the Roman Church. The good and chaste life
of this man, beloved of God, was in the opinion of all so deserving
that none opposed his election, no one was absent,
and none dissented from it. For why should not men agree
unanimously upon him whom the incomparable and unfailing
providence of our God had foreordained to this office?
For without doubt this had been determined upon in the
presence of God. So solemnly performing his decrees and
confirming with our signatures the desires of hearts concerning
his election, we have sent you our fellow-servants as the
bearers of this letter (<hi rend='italic'>names</hi>), most holy bishop
(<hi rend='italic'>name</hi>), venerable presbyter (<hi rend='italic'>name</hi>),
regionary notary (<hi rend='italic'>name</hi>), regionary
subdeacons (<hi rend='italic'>names</hi>), honorable citizens, and from the most
<pb n='682'/><anchor id='Pg682'/>
flourishing and successful Roman army (<hi rend='italic'>name</hi>), most eminent
consul, and (<hi rend='italic'>names</hi>) chief men, tribunes of the army, begging
and praying together that your excellency, whom may God
preserve, may with your accustomed goodness agree with our
pious choice; because he, who has been unanimously elected
by our humility, is such that so far as human discernment is
able to see, no spot of reproach appears in him. And therefore
we beg and beseech you, by God's inspiration, to grant
our petition quickly, because there are many questions and
other matters arising daily which require for remedy the care
of pontifical favor. And the affairs of the province and the
need of causes connected therewith also seek and await the
control of due authority. Besides we need some one to keep
the neighboring enemy in check, which can only be done by
the power of God, and of the Prince of the Apostles through
his vicar, the bishop of Rome; since it is well known that at
various times the bishop of Rome has driven off enemies by
his warnings, and at other times he has turned aside and restrained
them by his prayers; so that by his words alone, on
account of their reverence for the Prince of the Apostles, they
have offered voluntary obedience, and thus they, whom the
force of arms had not overcome, have yielded to the warnings
and prayers of the Pope.
</p>

<p>
Since these things are so, we again and again beseech you,
our exalted lord, preserved by God, that, with the aid and inspiration
of God in your heart, you may quickly give orders
to adorn the Apostolic See by the completed ordination of
the same, our father. And we, your humble servants, on seeing
our desires fulfilled, may then give unceasing thanks to
God and to you, and with our spiritual pastor, our bishop,
enthroned in the Apostolic Seat, we may pour out prayers
for the life and health and complete victories of our most
exalted and Christian lords (<hi rend='italic'>names</hi>), the great and victorious
emperors, that the merciful God may give manifold victories
to their royal courage, and cause them to triumph over all
peoples, and that God may give them joy of heart, because the

ancient rule of Rome has been restored. For we know that he
whom we have elected Pope can, with his prayers, influence
the divine omnipotence; and he has prepared a joyful increase
for the Roman Empire, and he will aid you in this, in the
government of this province of Italy, which is subject to you,
and will aid and protect all of us, your servants, through many

strong, brave man, and walked in the paths of justice; in
Christian faith, however, he did not hold to the right way,
but was polluted by the unbelief of the Arian heresy. The
Arians say, to their confusion, that the Son is inferior to the
Father and, in the same way, the Holy Ghost is inferior to
the Father and the Son; we, Catholic Christians, on the contrary,
confess that the Father and the Son and the Holy
Ghost are one true God in three persons, equal in power and
glory. In the times of Rothari there were in nearly all the
cities of his kingdom two bishops, a Catholic and an Arian.

To this very day there is shown in the city of Ticinus [Pavia]

Eusebius, and held the baptistery while the Catholic bishop was
at the head of another church. The Arian bishop, however,
who was in this city, whose name was Anastasius, accepted the
Catholic faith and afterward ruled the Church of Christ.
This king Rothari caused the laws of the Lombards to be reduced
to writing and named the book <hi rend='italic'>The Edict</hi>; the law of
the Lombards up to that time had been retained merely in
memory and by their use in the courts. This took place, as

<head>§ 109. Rome, Constantinople, and the Lombards in the
Period of the First Iconoclastic Controversy;
the Seventh General Council, Nicæa, A. D. 787</head>

<p>
By the eight century the veneration of pictures or icons
had become wide-spread throughout the Eastern Church.
Apart from their due place in the cultus, grave abuses and
superstitions had arisen in many parts of the Church in connection
with the icons. To Leo III the Isaurian (717-741),
and to the army, the veneration of the icons, as practised
by the populace, and especially by the monks, seemed but
little removed from the grossest idolatry. Accordingly, in
an edict issued in 726, Leo attempted to put an end to the
abuses by preventing all veneration of the icons. Meeting
with opposition, his measures passed from moderate to
severe. In Italy, although the use of icons was not developed
to the same extent as in the East, sympathy was entirely
against the Iconoclasts. Gregory II (715-731) and Gregory
III (731-741) bitterly reproached and denounced the action
of the Emperor. Nearly all the exarchate willingly passed
under the power of the Lombards. Other parts of northern
Italy also broke with the Emperor. Leo retaliated by annexing
<pb n='685'/><anchor id='Pg685'/>
Illyricum to the see of Constantinople and confiscating the
papal revenues in southern Italy. From that time the connection
between the Pope and the Emperor was very slight.
The Emperor Constantine V Copronymus (741-775) was more
severe than his father, and in many respects even fiercely
brutal in his treatment of the monks. A synod was assembled
at Constantinople, 754, attended by three hundred and thirty-eight
bishops, who, as was customary in Eastern synods, supported
the Emperor. His son, Leo IV Chazarus (775-780)
was less energetic and disposed to tolerate the use of icons in
private. But his widow, Irene, the guardian of her infant
son, Constantine VI, was determined to restore the images or
icons. A synod held at Constantinople in 786 was broken up
by the soldiery of the capital. In 787 at Nicæa, a council was
called at a safe distance and Iconoclasm was condemned.

Disorders in Italy consequent upon Iconoclasm.

<quote rend="display">
The following passage from the <hi rend='italic'>Liber Pontificalis</hi> gives a vivid
and, on the whole, accurate picture of the confusion in Italy during the last
years of the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire in the peninsula.
It is hardly likely that the Emperor ordered the death of the pontiff
as recorded, and more probable that his over-officious representatives
regarded it as a means of ingratiating themselves with their master.
The passage is strictly contemporaneous, as the <hi rend='italic'>Liber
Pontificalis</hi>, at least in this part, is composed of brief biographies
of Popes written immediately after their decease and in some instances during
their lives. For a fuller statement of the whole period, see Hefele, §§ 332
<hi rend='italic'>ff.</hi>, who gives an abstract of the following and also of
two letters alleged to have been written by Gregory II to the Emperor, which
Hefele accepts as genuine. For a criticism of these letters, see Hodgkin,
<hi rend='italic'>op. cit.</hi>, VI, 501-505. Hodgkin gives an excellent account of
King Liutprand in ch. XII of the same volume, pp. 437-508, and throws much light on
the following passage.
</quote>

<quote rend="display">
For the events immediately preceding this, see Paulus Diaconus,
<hi rend='italic'>Hist. Langobardorum</hi>, VI, 46-48, given above in
<ref target="Section_106">§ 106</ref>. Paulus refers
<pb n='686'/><anchor id='Pg686'/>
to the capture of Narnia in the last sentence of ch. 48. and his next
chapter is apparently a condensation of the following sections of the
official papal biography.
</quote>

<p>
At that time [<hi rend='italic'>circa</hi> A. D. 725]
Narnia<note place="foot">In the duchy of Spoleto.</note> was taken by the
Lombards. And Liutprand, the king of the Lombards, advanced
upon Ravenna with his entire army, and besieged it
for some days. Taking the fortress of Classis, he bore off
many captives and immense booty. After some time the
duke Basilius, the chartularius Jordanes, and the subdeacon
John, surnamed Lurion, conspired to kill the Pope; and
Marinus, the imperial spatarius, who at that time held the
government of the duchy of Rome, having been sent by the
command of the Emperor to the royal city, joined their conspiracy.
But they could not find an opportunity. The plot
was broken up by the judgment of God, and he therefore left
Rome. Later Paulus, the patrician, was sent as exarch to
Italy, who planned how at length he might accomplish the
crime; but their plans were disclosed to the Romans, These
were so enraged that they killed Jordanes and John Lurion.
Basilius, however, became a monk and ended his life hidden
in a certain place. But the exarch Paulus, on the command of
the Emperor, tried to kill the pontiff because he hindered the
levying of a tax upon the province, intending to strip the
churches of their property, as was done in other places, and to
appoint another [Pope] in his place. After this another spatarius
was sent with commands to remove the pontiff from his
seat. Then again the patrician Paulus sent, for the accomplishment
of this crime, such soldiers as he could withdraw
from Ravenna, with his guard and some from the camps.
But the Romans were aroused, and from all sides the Lombards
gathered for the defence of the pontiff at the bridge
of Solario, in the district of Spoleto, and the dukes of the
Lombards, surrounding the Roman territories, prevented this
crime.
</p>

<p>
In a decree afterward sent, the Emperor ordered that there
<pb n='687'/><anchor id='Pg687'/>
no longer should be in any church an
image<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>I.e.</hi>, a picture,
and not a statue, for these had been forbidden long since.</note> of any saint, or
martyr, or angel (for he said that all these were accursed);
and if the pontiff assented he should enjoy his favor, but if
he prevented the accomplishment of this also he should fall
from his position. The pious man, despising therefore the profane
command of the prince, armed himself against the Emperor
as against an enemy, rejecting this heresy and writing
everywhere to warn Christians of the impiety which had arisen.
</p>

<p>
Aroused by this, the inhabitants of the Pentapolis<note place="foot">Rimini,
Pesaro, Fano, Sinigaglia, and Ancona.</note> and
the armies of Venetia resisted the command of the Emperor,
saying that they would never assent to the murder of the pontiff,
but on the contrary would strive manfully for his defence.
They anathematized the exarch Paulus, him who had sent
him, and those who sided with him, refusing to obey them;
and throughout Italy all chose leaders<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Duces</hi>
can hardly mean dukes here.</note> for themselves, so
eager were all concerning the pontiff and his safety. When
the iniquities of the Emperor were known, all Italy started
to choose for itself an emperor and conduct him to Constantinople,
but the pontiff prevented this plan, hoping for the
conversion of the prince.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, in those days, the duke Exhiliratus,<note place="foot">Governor
of Naples under the Emperor.</note> deceived
by the instigation of the devil, with his son Adrian, occupied
parts of Campania, persuading the people to obey the Emperor
and kill the pontiff. Then all the Romans pursued after
him, took him, and killed both him and his son. After this
they chased away the duke Peter [governor of Rome under
the Emperor], saying that he had written against the pontiff
to the Emperor. When, therefore, a dissension arose in and
about Ravenna, some consenting to the wickedness of the
Emperor and some holding to the pontiff and those faithful
to him, a great fight took place between them and they killed
the patrician Paulus [exarch at that time]. And the cities
of Castra Æmilia, Ferrorianus, Montebelli, Verabulum, with
<pb n='688'/><anchor id='Pg688'/>
its towns, Buxo, Persiceta, the Pentapolis, and Auximanum,
surrendered to the Lombards.<note place="foot">These names are
not all to be identified. Auximanum, however, is Osimo,
south of Ancona; Ferronianus is Fregnano, near Modena; Montebelli or Monte
Veglio is west of Bologna; Persiceta is also near Bologna, which Paulus Diaconus
says was taken by the Lombards, <hi rend='italic'>op. cit.</hi>, VI, 49.</note>
After this the Emperor sent
to Naples Eutychius Fratricius, the eunuch, who had formerly
been exarch, to accomplish what the exarch Paulus, the spatarii,
and the other evil counsellors had been unable to do.
But by God's ordering his miserable craft was not so hidden
but that his most wicked plot was disclosed to all, that he
would attempt to violate the churches of Christ, to destroy
all, and to take away the property of all. When he had sent
one of his own men to Rome with written instructions, among
other things, that the pontiff should be killed, together with
the chief men of Rome, this most bloody outrage was discovered,
and the Romans would at once have killed the messenger
of the patrician if the opposition of the Pope had not
prevented them. But they anathematized the same exarch
Eutychius, binding themselves, great and small, by an oath,
never to permit the pontiff, the zealous guardian of the Christian
faith and the defender of the churches, to be killed or removed,
but to be ready all to die for his safety. Thereupon
the patrician [Eutychius], promising many gifts to the dukes
and to the king of the Lombards, attempted to persuade them
by his messengers to abandon the support of the pontiff. But
they despised the man's detestable wiles contained in his letters;
and the Romans and the Lombards bound themselves
as brothers in the bond of faith, all desiring to suffer a glorious
death for the pontiff, and never to permit him to receive any
harm, contending for the true faith and the salvation of
Christians. While they were doing this that father chose,
as a stronger protection, to distribute with his own hand such
alms to the poor as he found; giving himself to prayers and
fastings, he besought the Lord daily with litanies, and he remained
always more supported by this hope than by men;
however, he thanked the people for their offer, and with gentle
<pb n='689'/><anchor id='Pg689'/>
words he besought all to serve God with good deeds and to
remain steadfast in the faith; and he admonished them not
to renounce their love and fidelity to the Roman Emperor.
</p>

<p>
At that time in the eleventh indiction,<note place="foot">From
Sept. 1, A. D. 727, to Sept. 1, A. D. 728.</note> the castle of Sutri
was taken by the Lombards by craft, and was held by them

of the pontiff and warnings sent to the king, when very
many gifts had been made, as a gift at least for all the
towns, the king of the Lombards restored them and gave
them as a donation to the most blessed Apostles Peter and
Paul. At the same time, in the twelfth indiction [A. D. 729],
in the month of January, for ten days and more, a star, called
Gold-bearing,<note place="foot">Aurifer, or, according to another
reading, Lucifer.</note> with rays, appeared in the west. Its rays were
toward the north and reached to the midst of the heavens.
At that time, also, the patrician Eutychius and King Liutprand
made a most wicked agreement, that when an army had been
gathered the king should subject Spoleto and Beneventum,<note place="foot">Both
duchies were nominally under the king of the Lombards, but it is very
probable that they were attempting to free themselves from his rule.</note>
and the exarch of Rome, and they should carry out what was
already commanded concerning the pontiff. When the king
came to Spoleto, oaths and hostages were received from both
[<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the dukes of Spoleto and Beneventum], and he came with
all his troops to the Campus Neronis.<note place="foot">The
Campus Neronis was outside the walls of Rome, as they then extended
and adjoined the Vatican.</note> The pontiff went
forth and presented himself before him and endeavored to the
extent of his ability to soften the mind of the king by pious
warnings, so that the king threw himself at his feet and promised
to harm no one; and he was so moved to compunction
by the pious warnings that he abandoned his undertaking
and laid on the grave of the Apostle his mantle, his military
cloak, his sword belt, his short two-edged sword, and his golden
sword, as well as a golden crown and a silver cross. After
prayer he besought the pontiff to consent to make peace with
<pb n='690'/><anchor id='Pg690'/>
the exarch, which also was done. So he departed, for the king
forsook the bad designs with which he had entered into the
plot with the exarch. While the exarch remained in Rome,
there came into Tuscany to Castrum Maturianense,<note place="foot">Barberino,
fifteen miles east of Civita Vecchia.</note> a certain
deceiver, Tiberius by name, called also Petasius,<note place="foot">This
was his real name.</note> who attempted
to usurp the rule of the Roman Empire and deceived some of the
less important, so that Maturianum, Luna, and Blera [Bieda]
took oath to him. The exarch, hearing of this, was troubled,
but the most holy Pope supported him, and, sending with him
his chief men and an army, he advanced and came to Castrum
Maturianense. Petasius was killed, his head was cut off and
sent to Constantinople, to the prince; nevertheless the Emperor
showed no great favor to the Romans.
</p>

<p>
After these things the malice of the Emperor became evident,
on account of which he had persecuted the pontiff. For
he compelled all the inhabitants of Constantinople, by force
and persuasion, to displace the images of the Saviour as well
as of His holy mother, and of all saints, wherever they were,
and (what is horrible to tell) to burn them in the fire in the
middle of the city, and to whitewash all the painted churches.
Because very many of the people of the city withstood the
commission of such an enormity, they were subjected to
punishment; some were beheaded, others lost a part of their
body. For this reason also, because Germanus, the prelate
of the church of Constantinople, was unwilling to consent to
this, the Emperor deprived him of his pontifical position, and
appointed in his place the presbyter Anastasius, an accomplice.
Anastasius sent to the Pope a synodical letter, but when that
holy man saw that he held the same error, he did not regard
him as brother and fellow-priest, but wrote him warning letters,
commanding him to be put out of his sacerdotal office
unless he returned to the Catholic faith. He also charged the
Emperor, urging wholesome advice, that he should desist from
such execrable wickedness, and he warned him by letter.<note place="foot">See

<head>(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) John of Damascus, <hi rend='italic'>De Fide
Orthodoxa</hi>, IV, 16. (MSG, 94:1168.)</head>

<quote rend="display">
John of Damascus (<hi rend='italic'>ob. ante</hi> 754) was the last of the Church Fathers
of the East. He became the classical representative of the theology
of the Eastern Church, and his system forms the conclusion and summing
up of the results of all the great controversies that had distracted
that part of the Church. His greatest work, <hi rend='italic'>De Fide Orthodoxa</hi>,
may be found translated in PNF. In the following chapter John sums up
briefly the arguments which he uses in his three orations <hi rend='italic'>In Defence
of Images</hi> (to be found in MSG, 94:1227 <hi rend='italic'>ff.</hi>; for translation
see head of section). By images one should understand pictures rather than
statues. The latter were never common and fell entirely out of use
and were forbidden. They seemed too closely akin to idols. In the
translation, the phrase <q>to show reverence</q> is the equivalent of the
Greek προσκυνέω.
</quote>

<p>
Since some find fault with us for showing reverence and honoring
the image of our Saviour and that of our Lady, and also
of the rest of the saints and servants of Christ, let them hear
that from the beginning God made man after His own image.
On what other grounds, then, do we show reverence to each
other than that we are made after God's image? For as
Basil, that most learned expounder of divine things, says: <q>The
honor given to the image passes over to the prototype.</q><note place="foot">See
next selection.</note> Now
a prototype is that which is imaged, from which the form is
derived. Why was it that the Mosaic people showed reverence
round about the tabernacle which bore an image and type of
heavenly things, or rather the whole creation? God, indeed,
said to Moses: <q>Look that thou make all things after the pattern
which was shewed thee in the mount</q> [Ex. 33:10]. The
Cherubim, also, which overshadowed the mercy-seat, are they
not the work of men's hands? What is the renowned temple
at Jerusalem? Is it not made by hands and fashioned by the
skill of men? The divine Scriptures, however, blame those
who show reverence to graven images, but also those who
sacrifice to demons. The Greeks sacrificed and the Jews also
sacrificed; but the Greeks to demons; the Jews, however, to
God. And the sacrifice of the Greeks was rejected and condemned,
<pb n='692'/><anchor id='Pg692'/>
but the sacrifice of the just was acceptable to God.
For Noah sacrificed, and God smelled a sweet savor of a good
purpose, receiving, also, the fragrance of a good-will toward
Him. And so the graven images of the Greeks, since they
were the images of demon deities, were rejected and forbidden.
</p>

<p>
But besides this, who can make an imitation of the invisible,
incorporeal, uncircumscribed, and formless God? Therefore
to give form to the Deity is the height of folly and impiety.
And therefore in the Old Testament the use of images was
repressed. But after God, in the bowels of His mercy, became
for our salvation in truth man, not as He was seen by Abraham
in the semblance of a man, or by the prophets, but He became
in truth man, according to substance, and after He lived upon
earth and dwelt among men, worked miracles, suffered, and was
crucified, He rose again, and was received up into heaven; since
all these things actually took place and were seen by men,
they were written for the remembrance and instruction of us
who were not present at that time, in order that, though we
saw not, we may still, hearing and believing, obtain the blessing
of the Lord. But since all have not a knowledge of letters
nor time for reading, it appeared good to the Fathers
that those events, as acts of heroism, should be depicted on
images<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>I.e.</hi>, in pictures.</note>
to be a brief memorial of them. Often, doubtless,
when we have not the Lord's passion in mind and see the image
of Christ's crucifixion, we remember the passion and we fall
down and show reverence not to the material but to that
which is imaged; just as we do not show reverence to the
material of the Gospel, nor to the material of the cross, but that
which these typify.<note place="foot">John had a strong argument
here as the Iconoclasts reverenced the true cross.</note>
For wherein does the cross that typifies
the Lord differ from a cross that does not do so? It is the
same also as to the case of the Mother of God.<note place="foot">
θεομήτως, not θεοτόκος.</note> For the honor
which is given her is referred to Him who was incarnate of her.
And similarly also the brave acts of holy men stir us to bravery
<pb n='693'/><anchor id='Pg693'/>
and to emulation and imitation of their valor and to the glory
of God. For, as we said, the honor that is given to the best
of fellow servants is a proof of good-will toward our common
lady, and the honor rendered the image passes over to the
prototype. But this is an unwritten tradition, just as is also
to show reverence toward the East and to the cross, and very
many similar things.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Cf.</hi>
Basil, <hi rend='italic'>De Spiritu</hi>, ch. 27; <hi rend='italic'>v. supra</hi>,
<ref target="Section_87">§ 87</ref>, for Basil on the force of tradition.</note>
</p>

<p>
A certain tale is told also that when Augarus [<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, Abgarus]
was king over the city of the Edessenes, he sent a portrait-painter
to paint a likeness of the Lord; and when the painter
could not paint because of the brightness that shone from His
countenance, the Lord himself put a garment over His divine
and life-giving face and impressed on it an image of Himself,
and sent this to Augarus to satisfy in this way his desire.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, that the Apostles handed down much that was
unwritten, Paul the Apostle of the Gentiles writes: Therefore,
brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which ye have
been taught of us, whether by word or by epistles [II Thess.
2:14]. And to the Corinthians he writes: Now I praise you,
brethren, that ye remembered me in all things and keep the
traditions as I have delivered them to you [I Cor. 2:2].

<head>(<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>) Basil the Great, <hi rend='italic'>De Spiritu

<quote rend="display">
Basil is speaking of the three persons of the Trinity, and says that
although we speak of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, we must not
count up <q>by way of addition gradually increasing from unity to multitude,</q>
but that number must be understood otherwise in speaking
of the three divine persons.
</quote>

<p>
How then, if one and one, are there not two Gods? Because
we speak of a king and of the king's image, and not of two
kings. The power is not parted nor the glory divided. The
power ruling over us is one, and the authority one, and so also
the doxology ascribed by us is one and not plural; because
the honor paid to the image passes over to the prototype.
</p>

<pb n='694'/><anchor id='Pg694'/>

<p>
Now what in the one case the image is by reason of imitation,
that in the other case the Son is by nature; and as in works of
art the likeness is dependent upon the form, so in the case of
the divine and uncompounded nature the union consists in
the communion of the godhead.

<p>
The holy, great and ecumenical synod which, by the grace
of God and the command of the pious and Christ-loving
Emperors, Constantine, and Irene his mother, was gathered
together for the second time at Nicæa, the illustrious metropolis
of the eparchy of Bithynia, in the holy Church of God
which is named Sophia, having followed the tradition of the
Catholic Church, hath defined as follows:
</p>

<p>
Christ our Lord, who hath bestowed upon us the light of
the knowledge of Himself, and hath redeemed us from the
darkness of idolatrous madness, having espoused to Himself
His holy Catholic Church without spot or defect, promised
that He would so preserve her; and assured His holy disciples,
saying, <q>I am with you always, even unto the end of the
world</q> [Matt. 28:20], which promise He made, not only to
them, but to us also who through them should believe in His
name. But some, not considering this gift, and having
become fickle through the temptation of the wily enemy, have
fallen from the right faith; for, withdrawing from the tradition
of the Catholic Church, they have erred from the knowledge
of the truth, and as the proverb saith: <q>The husbandmen
have gone astray in their own husbandry, and have
gathered in their hands sterility,</q> because certain priests in
deed, but not priests in reality, had dared to slander the God-approved
ornaments of the sacred monuments. Of whom God
<pb n='695'/><anchor id='Pg695'/>
cries aloud through the prophet: <q>Many pastors have corrupted
my vineyard, they have polluted my portion</q> [Jer.
12:10; <hi rend='italic'>cf.</hi> LXX]. And, forsooth, following profane men,
trusting to their own senses, they have calumniated His holy
Church espoused to Christ our God, and have not distinguished
between holy and profane, styling the images of the
Lord and of His saints by the same name as the statute of
diabolical idols. Seeing which things, our Lord God (not
willing to behold His people corrupted by such manner of
plague) hath of His good pleasure called us together, the chief
of His priests, from every quarter, moved with a divine zeal
and brought hither by the will of our Emperors, Constantine
and Irene, to the end that the divine tradition of the Catholic
Church may receive stability by our common decree. Therefore,
with all diligence, making a thorough examination and
investigation, and following the trend of the truth, diminishing
naught, adding naught, we preserve unchanged all
things which pertain to the Catholic Church, and following
the six ecumenical synods, especially that which met in this
illustrious metropolis of Nicæa, as also that which was afterward
gathered together in the God-preserved royal city.
</p>

<p>
We believe in one God … life of the world to come. Amen.<note place="foot">The
creed of Nicæa is not here recited, only the so-called creed of Constantinople,
but without the <hi rend='italic'>filioque</hi> in the Greek.</note>
</p>

<p>
We detest and anathematize Arius and all who agree with
him and share his absurd opinion; also Macedonius and those
who, following him, are well styled foes of the
Spirit.<note place="foot">Pneumatomachians.</note> We
confess that our lady, St. Mary, is properly and truly the
Theotokos, because she bore, after the flesh, one of the Holy
Trinity, to wit, Christ our God, as the Council of Ephesus has
already defined, when it cast out of the Church the impious
Nestorius with his allies, because he introduced a personal
[προσωπικὴν] duality [in Christ]. With the Fathers of this
synod we confess the two natures of Him who was incarnate
for us of the immaculate Theotokos and ever-Virgin Mary,
<pb n='696'/><anchor id='Pg696'/>
recognizing Him as perfect God and perfect man, as also the
Council of Chalcedon hath promulgated, expelling from the
divine Atrium as blasphemers, Eutyches and Dioscurus; and
placing with them Severus, Peter, and a number of others
blaspheming in divers fashions. Moreover, with these we
anathematize the fables of Origen, Evagrius, and Didymus,
in accordance with the decision of the Fifth Council held at
Constantinople. We affirm that in Christ there are two wills
and operations according to the reality of each nature, as also
the Sixth Council held at Constantinople taught, casting out
Sergius, Honorius, Cyrus, Pyrrhus, Macarius, and those
who are unwilling to be reverent and who agree with these.
</p>

<p>
To make our confession short, we keep unchanged all the
ecclesiastical traditions handed down to us, written or unwritten,
and of these one is the making of pictorial representations,
agreeable to the history of the preaching of the Gospel,
a tradition useful in many respects, but especially in this,
that so the incarnation of the Word of God is shown forth as
real and not merely fantastic, for these have mutual indications,
and without doubt have also mutual significations.
</p>

<p>
We, therefore, following the royal pathway and the divinely
inspired authority of our holy Fathers and the traditions of
the Catholic Church for, as we all know, the Holy Spirit
dwells in her, define with all certitude and accuracy, that just
as the figure of the precious and life-giving cross, so also the
venerable and holy images, as well in painting and mosaic,
as of other fit materials, should be set forth in the holy churches
of God, and on the sacred vessels and on the vestments and
on hangings and in tablets both in houses and by the wayside,
to wit, the figure of our Lord God and Saviour Jesus Christ,
of our spotless lady, the Theotokos, of the venerable angels,
of all saints, and of all pious people. For by so much the more
frequently as they are seen in artistic representation, by so
much the more readily are men lifted up to the memory of
their prototypes, and to a longing after them; and to these
should be given due salutation and honorable reverence
<pb n='697'/><anchor id='Pg697'/>
[ἀσπασμὸν καὶ τιμητικὴν προσκύνησιν], not indeed that true
worship [τὴν ἀληθινὴν λατρείαν] which pertains alone to the divine
nature; but to these, as to the figure of the precious and
life-giving cross, and to the book of the Gospels and to other
holy objects, incense and lights may be offered according to
ancient pious custom. For the honor which is paid to the
image passes on to that which the image represents, and he
who shows reverence [προσκυνεῖ] to the image shows reverence
to the subject represented in it. For thus the teaching of our
holy Fathers, which is called the tradition of the Catholic
Church, which from one end of the earth to the other hath
received the Gospel, is strengthened. Thus we follow Paul,
who spake in Christ, and the whole divine Apostolic company
and the holy Fathers, holding fast the traditions which we
have received. So we sing prophetically the triumphal hymns
of the Church: Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion; Shout,
O daughter of Jerusalem. Rejoice and be glad with all thy
heart. The Lord hath taken away from thee the oppression
of thy adversaries; thou art redeemed from the hand of thy
enemies: The Lord is a king in the midst of thee; thou shalt
not see evil any more, and peace be unto thee forever.
</p>

<p>
Those, therefore, who dare to think or teach otherwise, or
as wicked heretics dare to spurn the traditions of the Church
and to invent some novelty, or else to reject some of those
things which the Church hath received, to wit, the book of
the Gospels, or the image of the cross, or the pictorial icons,
or the holy relics of a martyr, or evilly and sharply to devise
anything subversive of the lawful traditions of the Catholic
Church, or to turn to common uses the sacred vessels and the
venerable monasteries, if they be bishops or clerics we command
that they be deposed; if
religious<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>I.e.</hi>, monks.</note>
or laics, that they be
cut off from communion.
