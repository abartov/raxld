To-Do List for the Interedition Open Annotation Collaboration Server

- add an option to the annotations query that dumps the annotations in full, not just their URIs
- Fix insertion logic
  - sort annotations by start position
  - handle overlapping annotations correctly
- Add support for line= positions
- Improve look of annotated text renderer
- Add support for images as annotation targets in the renderer
- Support editing annotations with PUT operations
- Implement access control (API keys?)
- Make annotations versioned entities?
- Update annotation constraints when the constraint service returns an updated position, while keeping the original position as well
- Make validation phase configurable (on/off, validation service URL, currently hard-coded in annotations_controller.rb)
- if there's no constraint, I currently just ignore the annotation.  TODO: eventually, place the annotation at the beginning of the URI -- i.e. treat URI frags correctly
- Add an HTML interface to everything beside the renderer
- Add query options (by author, by annotation type)
- Accept and emit RDF
